'''17th century philosophy''' is generally regarded as seeing the start of [[modern philosophy]], and the shaking off of the medieval approach, especially [[scholasticism]]. It succeeded the [[Renaissance]] and preceded the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It is often considered to be part of [[early modern philosophy]].

==History==
The period is usually taken to start in the seventeenth century with the work of [[René Descartes]], who set much of the agenda as well as much of the methodology for those who came after him.  The period is typified in Europe by the great system-builders &amp;mdash;  philosophers who present unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]], and often [[politics]] and the physical sciences too. [[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1 "Immanuel Kant: Metaphysics"] ([[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[early modern philosophy]] is often characterised in terms of a conflict between these schools.

The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Building upon their English predecessors [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], the three main empiricists were [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].  The former were distinguished by the belief that, in principle (though not in practice), all knowledge can be gained by the power of our reason alone; the latter rejected this, believing that all knowledge has to come through the senses, from experience.  Thus the rationalists took [[mathematics]] as their model for knowledge, and the empiricists took the [[physical sciences]]. 

This period also saw the birth of some of the classics of [[political philosophy]], especially [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes)|Leviathan]]'', and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''.

The seventeenth century in Europe saw the culmination of the slow process of detachment of philosophy from [[theology]].  Thus, while philosophers still talked about &amp;ndash; and even offered arguments for the existence of &amp;ndash; a [[deity]], this was done in the service of philosophical argument and thought.  (In the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the "Age of Reason", [[18th-century philosophy]] was to go still further, leaving theology and [[religion]] behind altogether.)

'''''Adrsta''''' ({{lang-sa|अदृष्ट}}, Adr̥ṣṭa) is a concept in [[Indian philosophy]] which means that which is "unobserved, not seen, invisible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=adRSTa&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes adRSTa] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''adrsta'' is discussed in the ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'', the main text of the [[Vaisheshika]] Hindu school of philosophy, as part of its philosophical discussion on the nature of the universe. After explaining the atomistic cosmology that this school theorizes as the constituents of universe, it focuses on explaining phenomena such as motion and change. These occurrences are attributed to manifestations of ''adrsta'', or invisible forces and fields as causative reasons behind change.

In the [[philosophy]] of [[consciousness]], the '''anti-nesting principle''' states that one [[state of consciousness]] cannot exist within another.&lt;ref name=Kammerer2015&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How a Materialist Can Deny That the United States is Probably Conscious – Response to Schwitzgebel|journal = Philosophia|volume = 43|issue = 4|date = 2015-09-28|issn = 0048-3893|pages = 1047–1057|doi = 10.1007/s11406-015-9653-z|language = en|first = François|last = Kammerer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10 Tango Tree generated from the reference tree P after the last warm-up search for element 20, Nodes in pink are roots of Auxiliary trees.jpg|thumb|Arboresence is defined by vertical hierarchy rather than horizontal connections]]

'''Arborescent''' ({{lang-fr|arborescent}}) is a term used by the French thinkers [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] to characterize thinking marked by insistence on [[Universality (philosophy)|totalizing]] principles, [[binarism]], and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. The term, first used in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) where it was opposed to the [[rhizome (metaphor)|rhizome]], comes from the way [[genealogy tree]]s are drawn: unidirectional [[progress (history)|progress]], with no possible retroactivity and continuous binary cuts (thus enforcing a dualist metaphysical conception, criticized by Deleuze). Rhizomes, on the contrary, mark a horizontal and non-hierarchical conception, where anything may be linked to anything else, with no respect whatsoever for specific [[species]]: rhizomes are [[heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] links between things that have nothing to do between themselves (for example, Deleuze and Guattari linked together desire and [[machine]]s to create the - most surprising - concept of [[desiring-production|desiring machine]]s). [[Horizontal gene transfer]] is also an example of rhizomes, opposed to the arborescent [[evolutionism]] theory. Deleuze also criticizes the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] of [[formal languages]], which he considers a perfect example of arborescent dualistic theory.&lt;ref&gt; [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Félix Guattari | Guattari, Félix]]. 1980.

The '''Aristotelian Society for the Systematic Study of Philosophy''', more generally known as the '''Aristotelian Society''', was founded at a meeting on 19 April 1880, at 17 [[Bloomsbury Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Five individuals attended this meeting: [[Frederick Gard Fleay|Mr. F. G. Fleay]], [[Alfred Senier|Dr. Alfred Senier]] (1853-I918) (later Professor of Chemistry in the University of Galway), [[Herbert Burrows|Mr. Herbert Burrows]], [[Edward Clarkson|Mr. Edward Clarkson]], and [[Alfred Lowe|Mr. Alfred Lowe]] (Carr, 1928-1929, pp.360).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The Aristotelian Society resolved "to constitute a society of about twenty and to include ladies; the society to meet fortnightly, on Mondays at 8 o'clock, at the rooms of the Spelling Reform Association…"&lt;ref&gt;Carr (1928-1929), 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules of the society stipulated:

{{quote|The object of this Society shall be the systematic study of philosophy; 1st, as to its historical development; 2nd, as to its methods and problems.}}

According to [[H. Wildon Carr]], in choosing a name for the society, it was:

{{quote|essential to find a name which would definitely prescribe the speculative character of the study which was to be the Society's ideal, and it seemed that this could best be secured by adopting the name of a philosopher eminently representative. There is only one such name in the history of philosophy and so we became the Aristotelian Society, not for the special study of Aristotle, or of [[Aristotelianism]], but for the systematic study of Philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Carr (1928-1929), 361.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The society's first president was [[Shadworth Hodgson|Mr. Shadworth H. Hodgson]]. He was president for fourteen years from 1880 until 1894, when he proposed [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Dr. Bernard Bosanquet]] as his replacement.

Professor Alan Willard Brown [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/15/obituaries/dr-alan-w-brown.html] noted in 1947 that '[The Society]'s members were not all men of established intellectual position. It welcomed young minds just out of university as well as older amateur philosophers with serious interests and purposes. But many distinguished men were faithful members, and not the least virtue of the society has remained, even to the present day, the opportunity it affords for different intellectual generations to meet in an atmosphere of reasoned and responsible discussion.'."&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1947), p.249.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society continues to meet fortnightly at the [[University of London]]'s [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] to hear and discuss philosophical papers from all philosophical traditions. The current President (2016-2017) is [[Tim Crane]], a Professor of Philosophy at [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/about/the-council "The Council"], Aristotelian Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Its other work includes giving grants to support the organisation of academic conferences in philosophy, and, with [[Oxford University Press]], the production of the 'Lines of Thought' series of philosophical monographs.

The society's annual conference, organised since 1918 in conjunction with the [[Mind Association]], (publishers of the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''), is known as the Joint Session of the Aristotelian Society and the Mind Association, and is hosted by different university departments in July each year.

==Publications==
The first edition of the society's proceedings, the '''''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society for the Systematic Study of Philosophy''''', now the '''''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society''''', was issued in 1888.

Papers from invited speakers at the Joint Session conference are published in June each year (i.e., before the joint conference) in '''''The Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume'''''.

The Proceedings and the Supplementary Volume are published by the society and distributed by [[Oxford University Press]]. The back run of both journals has been digitised by [[JSTOR]].

The '''belief–desire–intention''' ('''BDI''') model of human practical reasoning was developed by [[Michael Bratman]] as a way of explaining future-directed intention.

BDI is fundamentally reliant on [[folk psychology]] (the 'theory theory'), which is the notion that our mental models of the world are theories. It was used as a basis for developing the [[belief–desire–intention software model]].

==Applications==

BDI was part of the inspiration behind the [[Belief–desire–intention software model|BDI software architecture]], which Bratman was also involved in developing. Here, the notion of intention was seen as a way of limiting time spent on deliberating about what to do, by eliminating choices inconsistent with current intentions.

BDI has also aroused some interest in psychology. BDI formed the basis for a computational model of childlike reasoning [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629002644/http://cognition.iig.uni-freiburg.de/csq/pdf-files/Wahl_Spada.pdf CRIBB]. It has been proposed that autistic children do not recognise other people as folk-psychological agents (i.e., agents with their own beliefs, etc.). BDI has been used to develop a [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7906/21803/01011803.pdf rehabilitation strategy] to teach autistic children to reason about other people.

'''Byzantinism''', or '''Byzantism''', is the political system and culture of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and its spiritual successors, in particular, the Christian [[Balkan]] states ([[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]]) and Orthodox countries in Eastern Europe ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and most importantly, [[Russia]]).&lt;ref name=dim3&gt;Dimiter G. Angelov, ''Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe'', in Dimitris Keridis, [[Ellen Elias-Bursać]], Nicholas Yatromanolakis, ''New approaches to Balkan studies'', Brassey's, 2003, {{ISBN|1-57488-724-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dim11&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.11]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''byzantinism'' itself was coined in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=dim8&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.8]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has primarily negative associations, implying complexity and [[autocracy]].

This negative reputation stressed the confusing complexities of the Empire's [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|ministries]] and the elaborateness of its court ceremonies. Likewise, the "Byzantine system" also suggests a penchant for intrigue, plots and assassinations and an overall unstable political state of affairs. The term has been criticized by modern scholars for being a [[generalization]] that is not very representative of the reality of the [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy]].&lt;ref name=dim6&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dim1718&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.17–18]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristocracy and bureaucracy==
{{Main|Byzantine bureaucracy}}

The [[Byzantine Empire]] is a modern term applied by Westerners to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (that survived a thousand years after the western one collapsed in 476) and thus had a complex system of [[aristocracy]] and [[bureaucracy]] which was derived from earlier [[Roman Empire|Roman]] systems. At the apex of the pyramid stood the [[Byzantine emperor|Emperor]], sole ruler and divinely ordained, and beneath him a multitude of officials and court functionaries operated the administrative machinery of the state. A key component of state power was the prestige of the Imperial institution and its long antiquity. Ceremony and the granting of both honorific titles and valuable offices was therefore extensive and elaborate.

Over the nearly fifteen hundred years of the empire's existence, different titles were adopted and discarded, and many lost or gained prestige. By the time of [[Heraclius]] in the 7th century many of the early Roman titles, grounded in the Latin language and the traditions of the old Roman republic had become obsolete in the now mostly Greek-speaking empire, although Latin survived longer in law and in the military. Heraclius formally changed the official language to Greek from Latin in 620. Titles inspired by their Greek tradition, often only rough approximation of Latin concepts, became common (i.e. "basileus" [βασιλεύς] instead of "caesar" or "augustus" for the title of the emperor himself). Other titles changed meaning (for example, "Patriarch") or were devalued with time (such as "consul").

Among important qualities of the Empire was also the [[caesaropapism]], the subjugation of church to the state.&lt;ref name=dim4-5&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.4–5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[Byzantine Empire]] acquired a negative reputation in the [[Western world]] as early as the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim7&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.6]&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the 9th century and the [[East–West Schism]] in the 11th century made the Empire an outcast to the Western European countries following the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]], and the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|siege and sack of Constantinopole]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 only cemented those differences.&lt;ref name=dim7/&gt; Hence the European medieval stereotypes of the people of the Byzantine Empire portrayed them as perfidious, treacherous, servile, effeminate and unwarlike.&lt;ref name=dim7/&gt;

Medievalist [[Steven Runciman]] described the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]]an view of the Byzantine Empire by saying:
{{quote|Ever since our rough crusading forefathers first saw [[Constantinople]] and met, to their contemptuous disgust, a society where everyone read and wrote, ate food with forks and preferred diplomacy to war, it has been fashionable to pass the Byzantines by with scorn and to use their name as synonymous with decadence.|[[Steven Runciman]], ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and His Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium'', 1988&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and His Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-521-35722-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XHVzWN6gqxQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Ever+since+our+rough+crusading+forefathers+first+saw%22&amp;ei=Xp8JSseLL4SSzQSa2LH4Cw Google Print, p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Criticism of the Empire continued among historians of the 18th century and 19th century, particularly in the works of historians and philosophers influenced by [[The Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], [[Hegel]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[William Lecky]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Voltaire]] were among the many Western writers of that period who were critical of the Byzantine system.&lt;ref name=dim8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Mango, ''The Oxford history of Byzantium'', Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-814098-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6-kHUyyUIsC&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=Edward+Gibbon+decadent+Byzantium&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=tqgJSr3kAqG2zQTqzeiQDw Google Print, p.v]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Of that Byzantine empire, the universal verdict of history is that it constitutes, without a single exception, the most thoroughly base and despicable form that civilization has yet assumed. There has been no other enduring civilization so absolutely destitute of all forms and elements of greatness, and none to which the epithet "mean" may be so emphatically applied ... The history of the empire is a monotonous story of the intrigues of priests, eunuchs, and women, of poisonings, of conspiracies, of uniform ingratitude.|[[William Lecky]], ''A history of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne'' 2 vols.

[[Edward Gibbon]], the first English historian to write a full [[history of the Byzantine Empire]] in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776–1789), was a sharp critic of the Empire.&lt;ref name=dim9&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.9]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Burckhardt]], an influential 19th-century historian shared Gibbon's view:

{{quote|At its summit was despotism, infinitely strengthened by the union of churchly and secular dominion; in the place of morality it imposed orthodoxy; in the place of unbridled and demoralized expression of the natural instincts, hypocrisy and pretense; in the face of despotism there was developed greed masquerading as poverty, and deep cunning; in religious art and literature there was an incredible stubbornness in the constant repetition of obsolete motifs.|[[Jacob Burckhardt]], ''The age of Constantine the Great''&lt;ref name=dim10&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;vq=stubbornness&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.10]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics pointed out that the Byzantine Empire and its successors were uninfluenced by such major shifts in Western philosophy as the [[Investiture Controversy]], the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Renaissance]];&lt;ref name=dim4-5/&gt; and reduced the Byzantine political culture to [[caesaropapism]] and authoritarian political culture, described as [[authoritarian]], [[despotism|despotic]], and [[imperialist]]ic.&lt;ref name=dim9/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim10/&gt;

After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, critics of the Byzantine system pointed out that it has survived and "corrupted" other states, in particular, it has been used in the discourse of the political system, culture and society of the [[Russia]] (from the times of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] through the [[tsardom of Russia]] to the [[Russian Empire]] – see also [[tsarist autocracy]]),&lt;ref name=dim11/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim12&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=dim13&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.13]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ottoman Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Balkan]] states (the former European [[provinces of the Ottoman Empire]]).&lt;ref name=dim3/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim4-5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.12–13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians point out that this negative reputation is not necessarily true, and at the very least, a very simplistic [[generalization]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim1718/&gt; As a [[social constructivism|constructed term]], Byzantinism also shares those fallacies with a closely related term, [[Balkanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Angelov sums it up as follows:

{{quote|Byzantinism begins from simple stereotypes, passes through [[reductionism]] and [[essentialization]], and then proceeds to impute Byzantium's supposed essence onto modern Balkans or Russia as the burden of history. ... As a discourse of "otherness", Byzantinism evolves from, and reflects upon, the West's worst dreams and nightmares about its own self.|Dimiter G. Angelov, ''Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe''&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.13–14]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Praise==
While the Byzantine Empire was commonly seen in a negative fashion, there were exceptions. Byzantium was rehabilitated in France during the [[Age of Absolutism]], from the 17th century to the [[French Revolution]], in the works of such individuals as the [[Jesuit]] [[Pierre Poussines]].&lt;ref name=dim8/&gt;

As the Enlightenment swept Western Europe, French traditions found refuge in the [[Russian Empire]]. The term Byzantinism was used in a positive context by 19th-century Russian scholar [[Konstantin Leontiev]] in ''Byzantism and Slavdom'' (1875) to describe the type of society which [[Russian Empire]] needs to counter the [[liberalism|degenerating influence]] of the [[Western world|West]].&lt;ref name=dim12/&gt;&lt;ref name=pipes&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russian Conservatism and Its Critics: A Study in Political Culture'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-12269-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I1yCrMAfg_IC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, pp.148–149]&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev praised the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[tsarist autocracy]], and a society and political system that comprises authoritative power of the monarch, devout following of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the maintenance of [[obshchina]] for peasants, and sharp class division; he also criticized [[universal education]] and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=pipes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

{{quote|When we mentally picture Byzantinism we see before us as if... the austere, clear plan of a spacious and capacious structure. We know, for example, that in politics it means autocracy. In religion, it means Christianity with distinct features, which distinguish it from Western churches, from heresies and schisms. In the area of ethics we know that the Byzantine ideal does not have that elevated and in many instances highly exaggerated notion of terrestrial human individual introduced into history by German feudalism. We know the inclination of the Byzantine ethical ideal to be disappointed in all that is of this world, in happiness, in the constancy of our own purity, in our capacity here, below, to attain complete moral perfection. We know that Byzantinism (as Christianity in general) rejects all hope of the universal well-being of nations; it is the strongest antithesis of the idea of well-being of nations; it is the strongest antithesis of the idea of humanity in the sense of universal worldly equality, universal worldly freedom, universal worldly perfectibility, and universal contentment. |[[Konstantin Leontiev]], ''Byzantism and Slavdom'' (1875)}}

In Russian political discourse, Russia is sometimes affectionately called ''[[Third Rome]]'', the second Rome being the Eastern Roman Empire, which outlived its western counterpart at Rome itself, the first Rome, by a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Raphael Johnson, ''The Third Rome: Holy Russia, Tsarism and Orthodoxy'', The Foundation for Economic Liberty, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|0-9742303-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evgeny Pavlov, ''[http://www.eusanz.org/pdf/conf02/pavlov_eusanz_2002.pdf The new Third Rome?

In his article, "Was There Ever Byzantinism?"

'''Cartesian anxiety''' refers to the notion that, since [[René Descartes]] posited his influential form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-mind dualism]], Western [[civilization]] has suffered from a longing for [[ontology|ontological]] certainty, or feeling that [[scientific method]]s, and especially the study of the world as a thing separate from ourselves, should be able to lead us to a firm and unchanging [[knowledge]] of ourselves and the world around us. The term is named after Descartes because of his well-known emphasis on "mind" as different from "body", "[[self]]" as different from "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]". 

[[Richard J. Bernstein]] coined the term in his 1983 book ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis''.

The concept can be traced back to [[Epicurus]] (341 BCE – 270 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/1533.html|title=Kirchner: Kasualismus|website=Textlog.de|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however most of the original sources dealing with the concept have been lost and most material today is based on [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s  work ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (c. 3rd century CE), and copies plus developments by [[Titus Lucretius Carus|Lucretius]] (c. 99 BCE – c. 55 BCE) and [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]] (3 January 106 BCE – 7 December 43 BCE).&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/ "Epicurus"], Plato.Stanford&lt;/ref&gt;

Casualism assumes the universe came into existence as a random event, and was not created by any omnipotent entity. Followers have therefore often been accused of [[atheism]]. Casualism has certain atheistic traits, but none of the ancient philosophers denied the existence of gods.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epicurus postulates that the gods simply stay out of the day-to-day running of the universe and are not even aware of the existence of man.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt; The philosophy is based on observations of well known natural phenomena, such as ocean waves or the random fall of rain drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/785?msg=welcome_stranger|title=On the Nature of Things by Titus Lucretius Carus|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2018|website=Gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casualism is the concept of randomness as a philosophy.

'''Chee Soo''' (born '''Clifford Soo''', also known as '''Clifford Gibbs''', 4 June 1919 – 29 August 1994) was an author of books about the philosophy of [[Taoism]] and in particular [[Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan]], [[Qigong]], [[Ch'ang Ming]], [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] and [[Feng Shou]] 'Hand of the Wind' [[Kung Fu]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born on 4 June 1919 in All Souls, [[Marylebone]], London, Chee Soo was the son of Ah Chee Soo, a Chinese seaman and a pastry chef at the Westminster restaurant. His English mother was Beatrice Annie Alice Gibbs. They lived in Westminster. Although he enlisted in the [[British Army]] under the name Clifford Gibbs, his mother's maiden name, in later life he took his father's name and was known as Chee Soo. In a 1977 [[LBC]] radio interview Chee Soo described meeting a Chinese Martial Arts teacher from [[Shandong]] called [[Chan Kam Lee]] in Hyde Park when he was fourteen years old. Chee Soo said he was invited to Chan Lee's class in the summer of 1934, and this was the beginning of his martial arts training. Chee Soo said that Chan Kam Lee adopted him as a nephew, and taught him the arts whenever his work and time permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0010200177004 |title=Clifford Chee talks to Brian Hayes · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council |website=Bufvc.ac.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military career===
In 1937 Chee Soo joined the 2nd Battalion of the [[2nd Royal Tank Regiment|Royal Tank Regiment]] part of the 7th Armoured division known as the [[British 7th Armoured Division|Desert rats]]. During the Second World War, he was promoted to Lance-Corporal and Corporal in 1941, then to "Acting Serjeant" in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/namesearch/?FirstName=Clifford&amp;Surname=Gibbs&amp;RecordType=Ww2&amp;RecordDateStartYear=1939&amp;RecordDateEndYear=1945 |accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Military Medal]] after the [[Battle of Beda Fomm]] in Libya in February 1941, part of [[Operation Compass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/chee_soo_military_medal.png |format=PNG |title=4 Armd Bds, 7 Arm Div., Gibbs, Clifford |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his regiment were transferred to Burma he was captured by the Japanese on 19 April 1942 during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and forced to work on the [[Burma Railway|Death Railway]] as a [[Prisoner of war|POW]] where he contracted Malaria, he was later classified as a war crimes witness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1939 the Second World War broke out, and Chee Soo did his share of fighting as a Tank Commander in the Second Battalion of the Royal Tank Corps, in France, in North Africa — where he won the Military Medal, and in Burma where, after a hectic battle, he was finally taken prisoner by the Japanese. He went through many periods of beatings, torture, starvation and very hard work as a member of a working party in the mountains between India and Burma. Finally, three years later, as the Japanese started to retreat from the advancing Allies, he managed to escape into the Shan Mountains of West Burma and made his way over very rugged terrain and through many jungles, till finally one month afterwards he was able to make contact with the Allies again. Three months after recuperation and treatment (for he then weighed only 84 lbs), he was flown back to England, where he was able to enjoy a long leave with his wife. After that, he was discharged from the forces and took a course in book-keeping, stock control, commercial history and sales promotion.
Chee Soo claimed that he managed to make contact with Chan Lee again after the war was finished, and the class in Holborn was restarted. In 1950, Chee Soo formed his own class in Manor Road School, West Ham, East London.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo page 139 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author [[Rupert Croft-Cooke]] who was Chee's friend from 1938 provides us with some biographical details of this period in Chee Soo's life in his book 'The Dogs of Peace'.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Clifford Gibbs had got his rather grand name from Dr Barnardo's Homes, for he had been reared in one of these, the son of a Chinese father and English mother, neither of whom he had ever seen. I had known him before the war and was as proud as he was of the Military Medal he had earned as a Corporal in the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa. He had been sent to Burma and taken prisoner by the Japanese, and suffered unspeakable tortures and humiliations because of his race, separated as he was from his fellow British. He had survived and, inwardly as inscrutable as a Conrad character, a little like Wang in Victory, he had married a blonde English girl and had an exquisite baby daughter whose godfather I became at a Sunday afternoon service in an East End Anglican church.
Clifford, who went about life methodically, was severely industrious and found the means of saving for his family even in those days of grudging wages. But he had a humorous cheerful side to his character and enlivened my flat during his weekly visits between office hours and his return to Durban Street, E.15. He was an expert wrestler and had earned the Judo black belt. Only from the depths of his character emerged sometimes the exotic or oriental; in speech and manner he was very much an Englishman, and it was strange to hear from his curved lips words that might have been used by any London ex-soldier. I am glad to have had his friendship throughout those years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Croft-Cooke]] – ''The Dogs of Peace'', W.H.Allen and Co 1973 {{ISBN|0-491-00864-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Teaching the Taoist Arts===
Chee Soo said that after the death of his teacher Chan Kam Lee, he went on to become the President of the International Taoist Society {{Citation needed|reason=This claim is sourced only from Chee Soo himself, and needs backing up with independent sources that don't originate from Chee Soo, his writings, or coverage based on them. Assuming that such a prominent International society existed, there would be records that could be cited, so it's not unreasonable to ask for them.|date=March 2017}} and taught a variety of martial arts ranging from self-defence techniques to healing and spiritual disciplines based on Chinese Medicine, ch'i kung and meditation.

Chee Soo's daughter Lavinia Soo-Warr adds that Chee Soo began learning [[Judo]] and [[Kendo]] in London after World War 2, and followed this up with training in [[Aikido]] with [[Kenshiro Abbe]] after his arrival in London in 1955. This history states that Chee Soo "switched back to the Chinese arts", possibly influenced by his negative experiences as a Japanese prisoner-of-war during WW2. Lavinia states that Chee Soo began teaching a small group in Dunstable in "Ch'i Shu". This is probably the Aikido-influenced system which Chee Soo demonstrates and is called "Qi Shu" or "Chinese Aikido" in contemporary Movietone footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage footage of Chee Soo Doing Qi Shu (Chinese Aikido)| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glhigfam4X4 | access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history says that later "as the Chi'Shu and Kung Fu systems became more popular, he introduced Taijiquan and the Chang Ming Diet", which suggests that Chee Soo was not teaching Tai Chi up to this point. Lavinia's history says that Chee Soo changed his teachings fundamentally "at least three times" during his teaching career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factual History of Chee Soo (English name, Clifford Gibbs) and Li Style Taijiquan| first=Lavinia | last=Soo-Warr | url=http://www.peterwarr.co.uk/wu-kung/articles-lavinia.asp | access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chee Soo, Chan Lee died in the winter of 1953–4 off the coast of China, near Canton, when the ship he was travelling in sank in a severe storm, and he was asked to take over the leadership of the association.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the association has grown in The British Isles, Australia, South Africa, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Mauritius and New Zealand.

Chee Soo taught 'The Eight Strands of the Brocade', comprising :
*Ch'ang Ming 	—	Taoist long life health diet therapy
*Ts'ao Yao 	—    	Taoist herbal therapy
*Anmo          	—    	Taoist massage
*Tao Yin         –    	Taoist respiration therapy
*Tien Chen	—    	Taoist Acupressure (Spot Pressing)
*Chen Tuan	—    	Taoist diagnosis techniques
*Chili Nung	—    	(The way of occlusion)

There are two associations which are affiliated to the Chinese Cultural Arts Association and the International Wu Shu Association.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Cultural Arts Association teach :
*T'ai chi ch'uan	—	The Supreme Ultimate
*K'ai Men	—	(Taoist Yoga or the Taoist form of Ch'i Kung)
*I Fu Shou	—	(Sticky Hands)
*Li Kung	        —	(Taoist development of Li energy)
*Mo Kun	        —	(Taoist Wand for Li energy control)
*Mo Hsiang 	—	(Taoist Meditation)
*T'ai Chi Dance 
*T'ai Chi Stick
*T'ai Chi Sword

The International Wu Shu Association teach:
*Feng Shou 	—	(‘Hand of the Wind' Kung fu, very soft, very gentle, and very fast, and suitable for women and men of all ages &lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;).
*Chi Shu		—	(A form of self defence with throws &amp; breakfalls similar to [[Aikido]], which Chee Soo studied after World War 2 )
*Tao Shu (Sword)
*Kan Shu (Stick/Spear)&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chee avengers.jpg|thumb|Chee Soo, Diana Rigg and Film Stunt arranger Ray Austin worked together on "The Avengers" cult TV series]]
Chee Soo was also involved as a fight choreographer with the cult TV series [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]] during the 1960s as is evidenced by publicity photographs of him with [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]] (himself a Black Belt third dan Kung Fu Master and pupil of Soo's) and [[Diana Rigg]] probably taken around 1967. He brought Kung Fu before a western audience years before Bruce Lee had even been heard of.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Guinness world record]] site states that "In 1965, Dame Diana Rigg (UK) became the first western actress to perform kung fu on Television when the combat choreographers Ray Austin (UK) and Chee Soo (UK/China) worked elements of the martial art into her fight scenes on The Avengers. Certificate presentation was done on [[The New Paul O'Grady Show]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-6000/first-western-actress-to-perform-kung-fu-on-television/ |title=First western actress to perform kung fu on television |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s he ran a Chinese Health and Herbal clinic in London.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan – Gordon and Cremonesi 1976 page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a British [[Movietone News]] documentary filmed on 21 May 1970 at Guildford in Surrey – UK, Chee Soo had over 2000 students studying [[Wushu (term)|Wu Shu]] in Britain as part of the British Wu Shu Association, and was one of only three men outside of Beijing qualified to teach Wu Shu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 | title=Chinese Martial Arts | publisher=movietone.com | id=Story number: 95962 | date=21 May 1970 | accessdate=23 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928101121/http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 | archivedate=28 September 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chee Soo appeared in a [[BBC]] [[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]] TV interview on 21 September 1973 where he demonstrated Kung fu self-defence techniques and inner power live in the studio with presenter [[Bob Wellings]]. Chee Soo talked about the history of Kung Fu and the difference between Northern and Southern kung fu styles in China and how it differs from Karate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/BBC%20TV%20interview%20Nationwide%201973.PNG |format=PNG |title=Nationwide |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Chee Soo was filmed by the BBC at his Feng shou kung fu class in Seymour Hall in London and subsequently appeared in a documentary broadcast for schools entitled '''Scene:Looking for a fight'''. His soft style kung fu self-defence class was contrasted with boxing and hard style kung fu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/BBC%20TV%20Looking%20for%20a%20fight%201975.PNG |format=PNG |title=Scene Looking for a Fight |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 he was interviewed by [[Brian Hayes (broadcaster)|Brian Hayes]] on [[LBC]] radio and talked about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan, meeting his teacher Chan Kam Lee and [[Reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0010200177004 |title=Clifford Chee talks to Brian Hayes · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council |website=Bufvc.ac.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings===
According to an interview with Marilyn Soo who is Chee Soo's widow, during the 1980s he moved to Coventry and spent his time writing and teaching courses in Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan and Feng Shou Kung Fu at the Alderman Callow School in Coventry (now called [[The Westwood Academy]]) and other locations around Britain, as well as visiting some of his students overseas in places like Australia and around Europe. Chee Soo was the author of five books published during his lifetime and one book published posthumously about Taoist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Tao of My Thoughts pages 127–150&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Ebbw Vale on 29 August 1994 as a result of an [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm|abdominal aneurism]] caused by [[Deep vein thrombosis]] probably aggravated by several [[Deep vein thrombosis#Travelers|long haul plane flights]] during the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;Tao of My Thoughts page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Chee Soo's books were first published in hardback by Gordon and Cremonesi from 1976, then by Aquarian Press (Thorsons/HarperCollins) from 1983 who published reprints throughout the 1980s which topped the best sellers listings for several years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2015">The '''Cheng–Zhu school''' ({{zh|p=Chéng Zhū lĭxué|t=程朱理學}}), is one of the major philosophical schools of [[Neo-Confucianism]], based on the ideas of the Neo-Confucian philosophers [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]], [[Cheng Hao]], and [[Zhu Xi]]. It is also referred to as the Rationalistic School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qs9W6Km6UC&amp;pg=PA545#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy |pages=545&amp;ndash;546 |isbn=9781400820030 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhu Xi's formulation of the Neo-Confucian world view is as follows. He believed that the Dao (Chinese: 道; pinyin: dào; literally "way") of Tian (Chinese: 天; pinyin: tiān; literally "heaven") is expressed in principle or li (Chinese: 理; pinyin: lǐ), but that it is sheathed in matter or qi (Chinese: 氣; pinyin: qì). In this, his system is based on Buddhist systems of the time that divided things into principle (again, li), and shi (Chinese: 事; pinyin: shì). In the Neo-Confucian formulation, li in itself is pure and almost-perfect, but with the addition of qi, base emotions and conflicts arise. Human nature is originally good, the Neo-Confucians argued (following Mencius), but not pure unless action is taken to purify it. The imperative is then to purify one's li. However, in contrast to Buddhists and Daoists, neo-Confucians did not believe in an external world unconnected with the world of matter. In addition, Neo-Confucians in general rejected the idea of reincarnation and the associated idea of karma.

Different Neo-Confucians had differing ideas for how to do so. Zhu Xi believed in gewu (Chinese: 格物; pinyin: géwù), the Investigation of Things, essentially an academic form of observational science, based on the idea that li lies within the world.

A '''closed-circle''' argument is one that is [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]].

[[Psychoanalytic]] theory, for example, is held up by the proponents of [[Karl Popper]] as an example of an [[ideology]] rather than a [[science]]. A patient regarded by his psychoanalyst as "[[in denial]]" about his [[sexual orientation]] may be viewed as confirming he is [[homosexual]] simply by denying that he is; and if he has had sex with women, he may be accused of trying to buttress his denials. In other words, there is no way the patient could convincingly demonstrate his heterosexuality to his analyst. This is an example of what Popper called a "closed circle": The proposition that the patient is homosexual is not falsifiable.

Closed-circle theory is sometimes used to denote a [[relativism|relativist]], [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] philosophy of science, such that different groups may have different self-consistent truth claims about the natural world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="844">A '''closed concept''' is a concept where all the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] required to include something within the concept can be listed. For example, the concept of a [[triangle]] is closed because a three-sided polygon, and only a three-sided polygon, is a triangle. All the conditions required to call something a triangle can be, and are, listed.

A '''co-premise''' is a [[premise]] in [[reasoning]] and [[informal logic]] which is not the main supporting reason for a [[main contention|contention]] or a [[Lemma (logic)|lemma]], but is logically necessary to ensure the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of an [[argument]]. One premise by itself, or a group of co-premises can form a reason. 

== Logical structure ==

Every significant term or phrase appearing in a premise of a [[simple argument]], should also appear in the contention/conclusion or in a co-premise. But this by itself does not guarantee a valid argument, see the [[fallacy of the undistributed middle]] for an example of this.

Sometimes a co-premise will not be explicitly stated. This type of argument is known as an 'enthymematic' argument, and the co-premise may be referred to as a 'hidden' or an 'unstated' co-premise and will often be subject to an [[inference objection]]. In this [[argument map]] of a simple argument the two reasons for the main contention are co-premises and not separate reasons for believing the contention to be true. They are both necessary to ensure that the argument as a whole retains logical validity.

In this example, "What the Bible says is true" is a hidden co-premise.

In early philosophies of [[psychology]] and [[metaphysics]], '''conatus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|ˈ|n|eɪ|t|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=conatus&amp;nbsp;— Definitions from Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conatus|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "effort; endeavor; impulse, inclination, tendency; undertaking; striving") is an innate inclination of a thing to continue to exist and enhance itself.&lt;ref name="Traup"&gt;{{Harvnb|Traupman|1966|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "thing" may be [[mind]], [[matter]], or a combination of both. Over the millennia, many different definitions and treatments have been formulated. Seventeenth-century philosophers [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]] made important contributions.&lt;ref Name="LeB"&gt;{{Harvnb|LeBuffe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--These last three constitute the "great early modern classic[s] of ''conatus''" {{Harv|Tuusvuori|2000|p=147}}.--&gt; The ''conatus'' may refer to the instinctive "will to live" of living organisms or to various metaphysical theories of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[inertia]].&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the concept is associated with [[God]]'s will in a [[pantheist]] view of [[Nature]].&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept may be broken up into separate definitions for the mind and body and split when discussing [[centrifugal force]] and inertia.&lt;ref name="Koll"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kollerstrom|1999|pp=331–356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the term ''conatus'' is that of a series of subtle tweaks in meaning and clarifications of scope developed over the course of two and a half millennia. Successive philosophers to adopt the term put their own personal twist on the concept, each developing the term differently such that it now has no accepted definition.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt; The earliest authors to discuss ''conatus'' wrote primarily in Latin, basing their usage on [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concepts. These thinkers therefore used "''conatus''" not only as a technical term but as a common word and in a general sense. In archaic texts, the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one, and they are also hard to differentiate in translation. In [[English (language)|English]] translations, the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by ''conatus'' in brackets.&lt;ref name="Leib89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1989|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''conatus'' is rarely used in the technical sense, since modern physics uses concepts such as [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]] that have superseded it. It has, however, been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]].

==Classical origins==
[[Image:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
The Latin ''[[wikt:conatus|cōnātus]]'' comes from the verb ''[[wikt:conor|cōnor]]'', which is usually translated into English as, "to endeavor"; but the concept of the ''conatus'' was first developed by the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] (333–264 BCE) and [[Peripatetics]] (c. 335 BCE) before the [[Common Era]]. These groups used the word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὁρμή|ὁρμή]]}} (''hormê'', translated in Latin by ''[[Theory of impetus|impetus]]'') to describe the movement of the soul towards an object, and from which a physical act results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], in SVF, III, 377; [[Cicero]], ''[[De Officiis]]'', I, 132; [[Seneca the Younger]], ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium]]'', 113, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Classical thinkers, [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (106–43 BCE) and [[Diogenes Laertius]] (c. 235 BCE), expanded this principle to include an aversion to destruction, but continued to limit its application to the motivations of non-human animals. Diogenes Laertius, for example, specifically denied the application of the term to plants. Before the [[Renaissance]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274 CE), [[Duns Scotus]] (c. 1266–1308 CE) and [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321 CE) expressed similar sentiments using the Latin words ''vult'', ''velle'' or ''appetit'' as synonyms of ''conatus''; indeed, all four terms may be used to translate the original Greek {{lang|grc|ὁρμή}}. Later&lt;!--Did Wolfson give exact date? I wrote down 1700, originally, but that is impossible.--&gt;, [[Telesius]] and [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]] extended the ancient Greek notions and applied them to all objects, animate and inanimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Wolfson|1934|pp=196,199,202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First [[Aristotle]], then Cicero and Laertius each alluded to a connection between the ''conatus'' and other emotions. In their view, the former induces the latter. They maintained that humans do not wish to do something because they think it "good", but rather they think it "good" because they want to do it. In other words, the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval views==
{{Further|Theory of impetus}}
{{See also|Physics in medieval Islam|Scholasticism|Medieval philosophy}}
There is a traditional connection between ''conatus'' and motion itself. Aquinas and [[Judah Leon Abravanel|Abravanel]] (1265–1321) both related the concept directly to that which [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430 CE) saw to be the "natural movements upward and downward or with their being balanced in an intermediate position" described in his ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'', (c. 520 CE). They called this force that causes objects to rise or fall, "''amor naturalis''", or "natural love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|pp=197,200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century, [[John Philoponus]] (c. 490–c. 570 CE) criticized Aristotle's view of motion, noting the inconsistency between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where the medium of [[aether (classical element)|aether]] keeps projectiles going, and his discussion of the void, where there is no such medium and hence a body's motion should be impossible. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of some surrounding medium but by some property, or ''conatus'' implanted in the object when it was set in motion. This was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for an inherent power to keep a body in motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|1988|pp=227,228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was strongly opposed by [[Averroës]] and many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers who supported Aristotle.&lt;ref name="Leaman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leaman|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aristotelian view was also challenged in the Islamic world. For example, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) seems to have supported Philoponus' views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sabra|1994|pp=133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he developed a concept similar to [[inertia]].&lt;ref name=salam&gt;{{Harvnb|Salam|1987|pp=179–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of inertia was developed more clearly in the work of his contemporary [[Avicenna]], who conceived a permanent force whose effect is dissipated only as a result of external agents such as [[air resistance]], making him "the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sayili|1987|p=477}}:
{{quote|"It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna's concept of ''mayl'' is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion and is reminiscent of [[Newton's first law of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sayili|1987|p=477}}: {{quote|"Indeed, self-motion of the type conceived by Ibn Sina is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion of the projectile type, and it is rather reminiscent of the principle of inertia, i.e., Newton's first law of motion."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna also developed an idea similar to [[momentum]], when he attempted to provide a quantitative relation between the [[weight]] and [[velocity]] of a moving body.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia|author=[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] &amp; Mehdi Amin Razavi|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-7007-0314-4|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Buridan]] (1300–1358) also rejected the notion that this motion-generating property, which he named ''impetus'', dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of [[momentum]]. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grant|1964|pp=265–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Descartes==
&lt;!--linked from 'René Descartes'--&gt;
{{See also|René Descartes}}
[[Image:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]
In the first half of the seventeenth century, René Descartes (1596–1650) began to develop a more modern, [[materialism|materialistic]] concept of the ''conatus'', describing it as "an active power or tendency of bodies to move, expressing the power of God".&lt;ref name="Piet"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pietarinen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the ancients used the term in a strictly [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] sense similar to voluntary "endeavoring" or "struggling" to achieve certain ends, and medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers developed a notion of ''conatus'' as a mysterious intrinsic property of things, Descartes uses the term in a somewhat more [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=150,154}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, for Descartes, in contrast to Buridan, movement and stasis are two states of the same thing, not different things. Although there is much ambiguity in Descartes' notion of ''conatus'', one can see here the beginnings of a move away from the attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaukroger|1980|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes rejects the [[teleology|teleological]], or purposive, view of the material world that was dominant in the West from the time of Aristotle.&lt;!--Steve Nadler refutes the use of "despite" here--&gt; The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The ''conatus'' is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no ''new'' motion or rest can be created or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gueroult|1980|pp=120–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes specifies two varieties of the ''conatus'': ''conatus a centro'' and ''conatus recedendi''. ''Conatus a centro'', or "tendency towards the center", is used by Descartes as a theory of [[gravity]]; ''conatus recendendi'', or "tendency away from the center", represents the [[centrifugal force]]s.&lt;ref name="Koll" /&gt; These tendencies are not to be thought of in terms of animate dispositions and intentions, nor as inherent properties or "forces" of things, but rather as a unifying, external characteristic of the physical universe itself which God has bestowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=180,184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes, in developing his First Law of Nature, also invokes the idea of a ''conatus se movendi'', or "''conatus'' of self-preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is a generalization of the principle of [[inertia]], which was developed and experimentally demonstrated earlier by [[Galileo]]. The principle was formalized by [[Isaac Newton]] and made into the first of his three [[Laws of Motion]] fifty years after the death of Descartes. Descartes' version states: "Each thing, insofar as in it lies, always perseveres in the same state, and when once moved, always continues to move."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackwell|1966|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hobbes==
&lt;!--linked from 'Thomas Hobbes'--&gt;
{{See also|Thomas Hobbes}}
[[Image:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]

===''Conatus'' and the psyche===
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), too, worked off of the previous notions of the ''conatus'' principle. However, he criticized the previous definitions for failing to explain the origin of motion. Working toward this end became the primary focus of Hobbes' work in this area. Indeed, Hobbes "reduces all the cognitive functions of the mind to variations of its ''conative'' functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Hobbes describes [[emotion]] as the beginning of motion and the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] as the sum of all emotions. This "will" forms the ''conatus'' of a body&lt;ref name="Piet" /&gt; and its physical manifestation is the perceived "will to survive".&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; In order that living beings may thrive, Hobbes says, "they seek peace and fight anything that threatens this peace".&lt;ref name="Piet" /&gt; Hobbes also equates this ''conatus'' with "imagination", and states that a change in the ''conatus'', or will, is the result of "deliberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmitter|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Conatus'' and physics===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I define [''conatus''] to be motion made in less space and time than can be given; that is, less than can be determined or assigned by exposition or number; that is, motion made through the length of a point, and in an instant or point of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobbes|1998|loc=III, xiv, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As in his psychological theory, Hobbes's physical ''conatus'' is an infinitesimal unit of motion. It is the ''beginning'' of motion: an inclination in a specified direction. The concept of ''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]'', as used by Hobbes, is defined in terms of this physical ''conatus''. It is "a measure of the ''conatus'' exercised by a moving body over the course of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friction|Resistance]] is caused by a contrary ''conatus''; [[force]] is this motion plus "the magnitude of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes also uses the word ''conatus'' to refer to the "restorative forces" which may cause [[Spring (device)|springs]], for example, to contract or expand. Hobbes claims there is some force inherent in these objects that inclines them to return to their previous state. Today, science attributes this phenomenon to material [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].&lt;ref name="Osler"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osler|2001|pp=157–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Spinoza==
{{See also|Baruch Spinoza}}
Conatus is a central theme in the philosophy of Benedict de Spinoza (1632–1677). According to Spinoza, "each thing, as far as it lies in itself, strives to persevere in its being" (''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', part 3, prop. 6). Spinoza presents a few reasons for believing this. First, particular things are, as he puts it, modes of God, which means that each one expresses the power of God in a particular way (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 6, dem.). Moreover, it could never be part of the definition of God that his modes contradict one another (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 5); each thing, therefore, "is opposed to everything which can take its existence away" (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 6, dem.). This resistance to destruction is formulated by Spinoza in terms of a striving to continue to exist, and ''conatus'' is the word he most often uses to describe this force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedictus de Spinoza]]]]

Striving to persevere is not merely something that a thing does in addition to other activities it might happen to undertake. Rather, striving is "nothing but the actual essence of the thing" (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 7). Spinoza also uses the term ''conatus'' to refer to rudimentary concepts of [[inertia]], as Descartes had earlier.&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; Since a thing cannot be destroyed without the action of external forces, motion and rest, too, exist indefinitely until disturbed.&lt;ref name="All"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral manifestation===
The concept of the ''conatus'', as used in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s [[psychology]], is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates principles that [[the Stoics]], [[Cicero]], [[Laertius]], and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|2006|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; One significant change he makes to Hobbes' theory is his belief that the ''conatus ad motum'', (''conatus'' to motion), is ''not'' mental, but material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza, with his [[determinism]], believes that man and nature must be unified under a consistent set of laws; [[God]] and [[nature]] are one, and there is no [[free will]]. Contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of the present, Spinoza rejects the dualistic assumption that mind, [[intentionality]], ethics, and freedom are to be treated as things separate from the natural world of physical objects and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jarrett|1991|pp=470–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal is to provide a unified explanation of all these things within a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] framework, and his notion of ''conatus'' is central to this project. For example, an action is "free", for Spinoza, only if it arises from the essence and ''conatus'' of an entity. There can be no absolute, unconditioned freedom of the will, since all events in the natural world, including human actions and choices, are [[determinism|determined]] in accord with the natural laws of the universe, which are inescapable. However, an action can still be free in the sense that it is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lachterman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings are thus an integral part of nature.&lt;ref name="All" /&gt; Spinoza explains seemingly irregular human behaviour as really "natural" and rational and motivated by this principle of the ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutton|2006|loc= chp. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he replaces the notion of free will with the ''conatus'', a principle that can be applied to all of nature and not just man.&lt;ref name="All" /&gt;

====Emotions and affects====
Spinoza's view of the relationship between the ''conatus'' and the human [[affect (psychology)|affects]] is not clear. [[Firmin DeBrabander]], assistant professor of philosophy at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], and [[Antonio Damasio]], professor of [[neuroscience]] at the [[University of Southern California]], both argue that the human affects arise from the ''conatus'' and the perpetual drive toward perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeBrabander|2007|pp=20–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Spinoza states in his ''Ethics'' that happiness, specifically, "consists in the human capacity to preserve itself". This "endeavor" is also characterized by Spinoza as the "foundation of [[virtue]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a person is saddened by anything that opposes his ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Bidney]] (1908–1987), professor at [[Yale University]], disagrees. Bidney closely associates "desire", a primary affect, with the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza. This view is backed by the Scholium of IIIP9 of the ''Ethics'' which states, "Between appetite and desire there is no difference, except that desire is generally related to men insofar as they are conscious of the appetite. So desire can be defined as appetite together with consciousness of the appetite."&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; According to Bidney, this desire is controlled by the other affects, pleasure and pain, and thus the ''conatus'' strives towards that which causes joy and avoids that which produces pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) was a student of [[Erhard Weigel]] (1625–1699) and learned of the ''conatus'' principle from him and from Hobbes, though Weigel used the word ''tendentia'' (Latin: tendency).&lt;ref name="Art98" /&gt; Specifically, Leibniz uses the word ''conatus'' in his ''Exposition and Defence of the New System'' (1695) to describe a notion similar that of Hobbes, but he differentiates between the ''conatus'' of the body and soul, the first of which may only travel in a straight line by its own power, and the latter of which may "remember" more complicated motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1988|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Leibniz, the problem of motion comes to a resolution of the [[paradox of Zeno]].
Since motion is continuous, space must be infinitely divisible. In order for anything to begin moving at all, there must be some mind-like, voluntaristic property or force inherent in the basic constituents of the universe that propels them. This ''conatus'' is a sort of instantaneous or "virtual" motion that all things possess, even when they are static. Motion, meanwhile, is just the summation of all the ''conatuses'' that a thing has, along with the interactions of things. The ''conatus'' is to motion as a point is to space.&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gillespie|1971|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this view is that an object that collides with another would not be able to bounce back, if the only force in play were the ''conatus''. Hence, Leibniz was forced to postulate the existence of an [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] that kept objects moving and allowed for elastic collisions. Leibniz' concept of a mind-like memory-less property of ''conatus'', coupled with his rejection of [[atom]]s, eventually led to his theory of [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]].&lt;ref name="Carl"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlin|2004|pp=365–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz also uses his concept of a ''conatus'' in developing the principles of the [[integral calculus]], adapting the meaning of the term, in this case, to signify a mathematical analog of Newton's accelerative "[[force]]". By summing an infinity of such ''conatuses'' (i.e., what is now called [[integral|integration]]), Leibniz could measure the effect of a continuous force.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; He defines ''[[Theory of impetus|impetus]]'' as the result of a continuous summation of the ''conatus'' of a body, just as the ''[[vis viva]]'' (or "living force") is the sum of the inactive ''[[vis mortua]]''.&lt;ref name="Duch"&gt;{{Harvnb|Duchesneau|1998|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the work of Kepler and probably Descartes, Leibniz develops a model of planetary motion based on the ''conatus'' principle, the idea of aether and a fluid [[vortex]]. This theory is expounded in the work ''Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis'' (1689).&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; According to Leibniz, Kepler's analysis of elliptical orbits into a circular and a radial component can be explained by a "harmonic vortex" for the circular motion combined with a centrifugal force and gravity, both of which are examples of ''conatus'', to account for the radial motion.&lt;ref name="Carl" /&gt; Leibniz later defines the term ''monadic conatus'', as the "state of change" through which his monads perpetually advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arthur|1994|loc=sec. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related usages and terms==
[[Image:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]]]
Several other uses of the term ''conatus'', apart from the primary ones mentioned above, have been formulated by various philosophers over the centuries. There are also some important related terms and concepts which have, more or less, similar meanings and usages. [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) defined ''conatus'' as the essence of human [[society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goulding|2005|p=22040}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also, in a more traditional, [[hylozoism|hylozoistic]] sense, as the generating power of movement which pervades all of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vico|1710|pp=180–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a century after the beginnings of modern science, Vico, inspired by [[Neoplatonism]], explicitly rejected the principle of inertia and the laws of motion of the new physics. For him, nature was composed neither of atoms, as in the dominant view, nor of extension, as in Descartes, but of ''metaphysical points'' animated by a ''conatus'' principle provoked by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landucci|2004|pp=1174,1175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860) developed a philosophy that contains a principle notably similar to that of Hobbes's ''conatus''. This principle, ''Wille zum Leben'', or "Will to Live", described the specific phenomenon of an organism's self-preservation instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rabenort|1911|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer qualified this, however, by suggesting that the Will to Live is not limited in duration. Rather, "the will wills absolutely and for all time", across generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=568}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), an early disciple of Schopenhauer, developed a separate principle which comes out of a rejection of the primacy of Schopenhauer's Will to Live and other notions of self-preservation. He called his version the [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Will to Power]], or ''Wille zur Macht''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Durant|Durant|1963|loc=chp. IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Nietzsche criticized Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle, arguing that if true, it would allegedly favour a stagnant Universe. He thought "the opposite is true"; every organism strives not to just to persevere, but to "become more" than it is and to exert its creative strength. Spinoza's conatus, however, was much more alike to such an understanding than to simple self-preservation, as it was akin to empowerment. DIFFICULT TO SOURCE: SEE TALK PAGE--&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939), greatly depended on Spinoza's formulation of the ''conatus'' principle as a system of self-preservation, though he never cited him directly in any of his published works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), developed the principle of the ''[[élan vital]]'', or "vital impulse", which was thought to aid in the [[evolution]] of [[organism]]s. This concept, which implies a fundamental driving force behind all life, is reminiscent of the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schrift|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Max Scheler]], the concept of ''Drang'' is the centerpiece of [[philosophical anthropology]] and [[metaphysics]].  Though his concept has been important throughout his entire philosophical career, it was only developed later in his life when his focus shifted from phenomenology to metaphysics.  Like Bergson's ''élan vital,'' ''Drang'' (drive or impulsion) is the impetus of all life; however, unlike in Bergson's vitalistic metaphysics, the significance of Drang is that it provides the motivation and driving force even of Spirit (''Geist'').  Spirit, which includes all theoretical intentionality, is powerless without the movement of ''Drang'', the material principle, as well as ''Eros'', the psychological principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheler|2008|pp=231–41, 323–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] (1911–1988), described a ''cultural conatus'' built directly upon Spinoza's seminal definition in IIIP3&lt;!--reread this book--&gt; of his ''Ethics''. The principle behind this derivative concept states that any given culture, "tends to persevere in its being, whether by dominating other cultures or by struggling against their domination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Polt|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern significance==
&lt;!--conation--&gt;

===Physical===
After the advent of Newtonian physics, the concept of a ''conatus'' of all physical bodies was largely superseded by the principle of [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]]. As Bidney states, "It is true that logically desire or the ''conatus'' is merely a principle of inertia&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the fact remains, however, that this is not Spinoza's usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''conatus'' was used by many philosophers to describe other concepts which have slowly been made obsolete. ''Conatus recendendi'', for instance, became the centrifugal force, and [[gravity]] is used where ''conatus a centro'' had been previously.&lt;ref name="Koll" /&gt; Today, the topics with which ''conatus'' dealt are matters of [[science]] and are thus subject to inquiry by the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological===
The archaic concept of ''conatus'' is today being reconciled with modern biology by scientists such as [[Antonio Damasio]].&lt;!--psychology and philosophy. --&gt; The ''conatus'' of today, however, is explained in terms of chemistry and neurology where, before, it was a matter of metaphysics and [[theurgy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept may be "constructed so as to maintain the coherence of a living [[organism]]'s structures and functions against numerous life-threatening odds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--NEED SOURCE This stability required to maintain life can also refer to the notion of [[homeostasis]] developed by [[Claude Bernard]] which later inspired the field of [[cybernetics]].--&gt;&lt;!--ALSO NEED SOURCE This ''conatus'' is similar to modern notions of the [[libido]] in the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] sense, and the animal directive of [[self-preservation]].--&gt;

====Systems theory====
The Spinozistic conception of a ''conatus'' was a historical precursor to modern theories of [[autopoiesis]] in biological systems.&lt;ref name=ziemke6&gt;{{Harvnb|Ziemke|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[systems theory]] and the [[sciences]] in general, the concept of a ''conatus'' may be related to the phenomenon of [[emergence]], whereby [[complex systems]] may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle;&lt;ref name=sandy144145&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandywell|1996|pp=144–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.&lt;ref name=mathews110&gt;{{Harvnb|Mathews|1991|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concepts''' are mental representations, abstract objects or abilities that make up the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

== Concepts in the representational theory of mind ==

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of concepts ==
{{main article|Abstract object}}

A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what concepts ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts – what they are really like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3–83|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept – or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

=== A priori concepts ===
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

===Embodied content===
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Ontology===
{{Main article|Ontology}}

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Mental representations ==
{{Main article|Mental representation}}

In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] – [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions – especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

=== Prototype theory ===
{{Main article|Prototype theory}}

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm" /&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member – the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

=== Theory-theory ===
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory–Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2733">In the [[philosophy of language]], the '''context principle''' is a form of [[semantic holism]]{{cn|date=April 2013}} holding that a philosopher should "never ... ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition" (Frege [1884/1980] x). 

==Analysis&lt;!--'Compositionalism' and 'Semantic contextualism' redirect here--&gt;==
The context principle is one of [[Gottlob Frege]]'s "three fundamental principles" for philosophical analysis, first discussed in his Introduction to ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (''Grundlagen der Arithmetik'', 1884). Frege argued that many philosophical errors, especially those related to [[psychologism]] in the [[philosophy of logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], could be avoided by adhering carefully to the context principle. The view of meaning expressed by the context principle is sometimes called '''semantic contextualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. This view need not be contrasted with the view that the meanings of words or expressions can (or must) be determined prior to, and independently of, the meanings of the propositions in which they occur, which is often referred to as '''compositionalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

The context principle also figures prominently in the work of other [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic philosophers]], such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who were greatly influenced by Frege's work.

== Formulations of the context principle ==
=== Gottlob Frege, Introduction to ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'' (1884/1980) ===

: In the enquiry that follows, I have kept to three fundamental principles:
:: always to separate sharply the psychological from the logical, the subjective from the objective;
:: never to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition
:: never to lose sight of the distinction between concept and object.

=== Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' (1921/1922) ===

: '''3.3''' Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning. ...
: '''3.314''' An expression has meaning only in a proposition. Every variable can be conceived as a [[propositional variable]].
: (Including the variable name.)

'''''Credo ut intelligam''''' (alternatively spelled '''''Credo ut intellegam''''') is [[Latin]] for "I believe so that I may understand" and is a maxim of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (''Proslogion'', 1), which is based on a saying of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (''crede, ut intelligas'', "believe so that you may understand"; ''Tract. Ev. Jo.'', 29.6) to relate [[faith]] and [[reason]]. In Anselm's writing, it is placed in juxtaposition to its converse, ''intellego ut credam'' ("I think so that I may believe"), when he says ''Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam'' ("I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand"). It is often associated with Anselm's other famous phrase ''[[fides quaerens intellectum]]'' ("faith seeking understanding").
Augustine understood the saying to mean that we must believe in something in order to know anything about God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Nash|Nash, Ronald H.]],"Faith and Reason," p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term has been used pejoratively to describe uncritical acceptance of questionable concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Tallis|Tallis, Raymond]], "The Shrink from Hell", ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' October 1997 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Doig''' [[FRSE]] LLD (1719–1800) was a Scottish educator, philologist and writer known for historical and philosophical works. He was Rector of Stirling High School from 1760 to 1800. Doig is also believed to have been the inventor of the tartan pattern now associated with [[Burberry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails?ref=440|title=Tartan Details - The Scottish Register of Tartans|first=National Records of|last=Scotland|website=www.tartanregister.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David Doig Silhouette.jpg|thumb|David Doig, silhouette]]
[[File:Memorial to David Doig, Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling.jpg|thumb|Memorial to David Doig, [[Church of the Holy Rude]], Stirling]]

==Life==
David was born 14 Feb 1719 at Mill of Melgund, [[Aberlemno]], Angus, son of David Doig and Ann Sturrock. His father, who was a small farmer, died while he was an infant, and his mother married again. He was successful in a Latin competition for a bursary at the [[University of St. Andrews]]. Having finished the classical and philosophical course and proceeded B.A., he began the study of divinity, but scruples regarding the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] prevented him from entering the ministry of the [[Church of Scotland]].

Doig taught from 1749 in the parochial schools of Monifieth, [[Kennoway]] and [[Falkland, Fifeshire]]. His reputation then gained for him the rectorship of the grammar school of [[Stirling]], a post he filled for over 40 years. In addition to Greek and Latin Doig had mastered Hebrew and Arabic. The [[University of Glasgow]] conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D., and on the same day he received from St. Andrews his diploma as M.A. He was also elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], and a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]].

Robert Burns visited Stirling on 27 Aug 1787 when he had dinner at the Golden Lion Hotel with Lieutenant Forrester of the Castle garrison, Dr David Doig of the Grammar School and Christopher Bell, a singing teacher. He later described Dr. David Doig as "a queerish figure, and something of a pedant." [Note: Robert Burns' school teacher in Maybole, Ayr was also a David Doig (1679/80-1784).]

Doig was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1798. His proposers were [[James Gregory (physician)|Dr James Gregory]], [[Andrew Dalzell]], and [[John Playfair]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doig died in [[Stirling]] on 16 March 1800, aged 81. He is buried in the Holy Rude Cemetery next to [[Stirling Castle]].

A mural tablet, with an inscription in commemoration of his virtues and learning, was raised by his friend [[John Ramsay of Ochtertyre]]. The town of Stirling also erected a marble monument to his memory, with a Latin epitaph written by himself.

==Family==

Doig was married to Isabella Janet Bower (1727-1762) in [[Monifieth]] on 17 November 1749.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

They had children: Isabella, Ann, Jean, David, George, and Patrick. Their daughter Isabella (1751-1819) married Dr. John Aird (c.1740-1790) with sons William, David, and John. The next four children died young. Patrick Doig (1762-1833) married Jane Austin (1781-1849)with a son David (1812-1819); Patrick later became a medical doctor in Antigua.

==Works==
Doig's first known appearance in print was some twenty pages of annotation on the ''[[Gaberlunzie-man]]'', in an edition of that and another old Scottish poem, ''[[Christis Kirk on the Green|Christ's Kirk on the Green]]'', published in 1782 by his friend and neighbour [[John Callander]] of Craigforth. ''Two Letters on the Savage State, addressed to the late Lord Kaims'' (London, 1792) attacked the views of [[Lord Kames]] in ''[[Sketches of the History of Man]]'' (1774). The first of the letters, from 1775, had been sent to Kames, who was passing the Christmas vacation a few miles from Stirling, and who invited Doig to dinner next day.

Doig's next publication was ''Extracts from a Poem on the Prospect from Stirling Castle'' (Stirling, 1796). He contributed to vol. iii. of the ''Transactions'' of the Royal Society of Edinburgh a dissertation "On the Ancient Hellenes". He also wrote in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' third edition]] the articles on "Mythology", "Mysteries", and "Philology". They brought Doig correspondence with [[William Vincent (priest)|William Vincent]] and [[Jacob Bryant]].

Besides Latin and English poems Doig left some treatises in manuscript. A partial list  was in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 8th edit. viii. 92.

[[File:Cagnacci Allegoria.jpg|thumb|An [[allegorical]] painting of a woman, representing eternity. She holds an [[hourglass]], a skull rests on the table beside her, and an [[Ouroboros]] floats above her head. All of these are common symbols of eternity.]]

'''Eternity''' in [[common parlance]] is an infinitely long period of [[time]]. In [[classical philosophy]], however, eternity is defined as what exists outside time while sempiternity is the concept that corresponds to the colloquial definition of eternity. 

Eternity is an  important concept in many [[religion]]s, where the god or gods are said to endure eternally. Some, such as [[Aristotle]], would say the same about the natural [[cosmos]] in regard to both past and future eternal duration, and like the eternal [[Platonic realism|Platonic form]]s, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]] was considered essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eternity/#Ety |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Eternity |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Philosophy of space and time}}
[[Aristotle]] [[arguments for eternity|argued]] that the [[cosmos]] has no beginning. In Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]], eternity is the [[unmoved mover]] (God), understood as the [[gradient]] of [[Minimum total potential energy principle|total synergy]] ("produces motion by being loved").&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Jiyuan [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5pRlUoAbmIC&amp;pg=PA188 The Structure of Being in Aristotle’s Metaphysics] Springer, 2003, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boethius]] defined eternity as "simultaneously full and perfect possession of interminable life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boedder|first1=Bernard|title=Natural Theology|url=http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/nath34.htm|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 15, 2015|quote=Aeternitas est interminablis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
Eternity is often symbolized by the image of a snake swallowing its own tail, known as the [[Ouroboros]] (or Uroboros). The circle is also commonly used as a symbol for eternity, as is the mathematical symbol of infinity, &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. {{cn|date=March 2015}}   Symbolically, it suggests that Eternity has no beginning or end.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born on 15 December 1923, at [[Crowthorne]] in [[Berkshire]], Dyson is the son of the English composer [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]], who was later knighted. His mother had a law degree, and after Dyson was born she worked as a social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/quarkpark_dyson.php |title=The Scientist as Rebel |access-date=5 December 2017}} Wild River Review Interview by Joy E. Stocke&lt;/ref&gt; Although not known to be related to the early 20th-century astronomer [[Frank Watson Dyson]], as a small boy Dyson was aware of him and has credited the popularity of an astronomer sharing his surname with helping to spark his own interest in science.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson. From Eros to Gaia 1992 p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five he calculated the number of atoms in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |medium=Video |title=Greatest Mysteries of the Cold War: America's Interplanetary Spaceship (Project Orion) |publisher=BBC Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he showed an interest in large numbers and in the solar system, and was strongly influenced by the book ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' by [[Eric Temple Bell]].&lt;ref name=wired20140331 /&gt; Politically, Dyson says he was "brought up as a socialist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ghodsee | first = Kristen | year = 2015 | title = The Left Side of History: World War II and the Unfulfilled Promise of Communism in Eastern Europe | location = Durham, NC | publisher = Duke University Press | page = 5 | isbn = 978-0-822-35823-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1936 to 1941, Dyson was a Scholar at [[Winchester College]], where his father was Director of Music. At age 17 he studied mathematics with [[G.H. Hardy]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (where he won a scholarship at age 15) and at age 19 was assigned to war work in the [[Operations research#Second World War|Operational Research Section]] (ORS) of the Royal Air Force's [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]],&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=Freeman|title=A Failure of Intelligence|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/406789/a-failure-of-intelligence/|website=MIT Technology Review Magazine|publisher=MIT Technology Review|access-date=20 October 2013|date=1 November 2006|quote=Prominent physicist Freeman Dyson recalls the time he spent developing analytical methods to help the British Royal Air Force bomb German targets during World War II.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed analytical methods to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; After the war, Dyson was readmitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;''Fractals in Physics: Essays in Honour of Benoit B. Mandelbrot : Proceedings of the International Conference Honouring Benoit B. Mandelbrot on His 65th Birthday, Vence, France, 1–4 October 1989'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in mathematics.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeman Dyson|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/dyson/|website=Institute for Advanced Study, School of Natural Sciences|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1946 to 1949, he was a [[Fellow]] of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who resigned his professorship in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (10 Nov 2011) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/what-can-you-really-know/?pagination=false "What Can You Really Know"], [[New York Review of Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Dyson published two papers in [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Approximation to Algebraic Numbers by Rationals," Acta Mathematica (Uppsala), 89, 1947, pp. 225–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"On Simultaneous Diophantine Approximations," Proceedings of the London
Mathematical Society, Series 2, 49, 1947, pp. 409–420.&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and colleagues describe him as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends find refreshing but his intellectual opponents find exasperating. "I have the sense that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice", [[Steven Weinberg]] said of him. His friend, the neurologist and author [[Oliver Sacks]], said: "A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life."&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dawidoff |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=magazine |title=The Civil Heretic |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|reason=How does the following pertain to character?|date=November 2013}}

===Career in the United States===
On [[G. I. Taylor]]'s advise and recommendation, Dyson moved to the United States in 1947 as a Commonwealth Fellow to earn a physics doctorate with [[Hans Bethe]] at [[Cornell University]] (1947–48).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |interviewer=Finn Aaserud |title=Freeman Dyson |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4585 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |location=Princeton, New Jersey |date=17 December 1986 |work=Oral History Interviews }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = QED and the Men Who Made It|last = Schweber|first = Silvan S.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Princeton, NJ|pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=61n5dE7FJQgC&amp;pg=492 392ff]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week, however, he had made the acquaintance of [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlaPLvETBug|title = Freeman Dyson: A 'Rebel' Without a Ph.D|last = |first = |date = 11 June 2015|language = |at = Event at 1:17 |publisher = Quanta Magazine|access-date = 20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budding English physicist recognized the brilliance of the flamboyant American, and attached himself as quickly as possible. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (1948–49), before returning to England (1949–51), where he was a research fellow at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |publisher=The American Institute of Physics |access-date=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017131442/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson never got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree.

In 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two then-current formulations of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED): [[Richard Feynman]]'s diagrams and the operator method developed by [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The radiation theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=75|pages=486–502|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.486|issue=3|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75..486D }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first person after their creator to appreciate the power of [[Feynman diagram]]s, and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool, but a physical theory, and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the [[renormalization]] problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Oppenheimer rewarded Dyson with a lifetime appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study, "for proving me wrong", in Oppenheimer's words.&lt;ref name="Dyson, F.J. 1979"/&gt;

Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the [[Dyson series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The S matrix in quantum electrodynamics|journal=[[Phys. Rev.]]|volume=75|pages=1736–1755|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.1736|issue=11|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75.1736D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this paper that inspired [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]] to derive his celebrated [[Ward–Takahashi identity#The Ward identity|Ward identity]].&lt;ref name="qeid-jw-1950"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J. C. Ward|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=78|page=182|year=1950|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..182W |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.78.182|title=An Identity in Quantum Electrodynamics|issue=2 }}. [Note: this Ward letter opens with "It has been recently proven by Dyson&amp;nbsp;..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Dyson joined the faculty at Cornell as a physics professor, although still lacking a doctorate, and in 1953, he received a permanent post at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he has now lived for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; In 1957, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States and renounced his [[British nationality law|British nationality]]. One reason he gave decades later is that his children born in the United States had not been recognized as British subjects.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abjure" /&gt;

From 1957 to 1961, he worked on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], which proposed the possibility of space-flight using [[nuclear pulse propulsion]]. A prototype was demonstrated using [[Explosive material|conventional explosives]], but the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|Partial Test Ban Treaty]], in which Dyson was involved and supported, permitted only [[underground nuclear weapons testing]], so the project was abandoned.

In 1958, he led the design team for the [[TRIGA]], a small, inherently safe [[nuclear reactor]] used throughout the world in hospitals and universities for the production of [[Isotopes in medicine|medical isotopes]].

A seminal paper by Dyson came in 1966, when, together with Andrew Lenard and independently of [[Elliott H. Lieb]] and [[Walter Thirring]], he proved rigorously that the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] plays the main role in the stability of bulk matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson, A. Lenard|journal=[[J. Math. Phys.]]|volume=8|issue=3|pages=423–434|year=1967|doi=10.1063/1.1705209|title=Stability of Matter. I|bibcode = 1967JMP.....8..423D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= F. J. Dyson, A. Lenard|journal=J. Math. Phys.|volume=9|issue= 5|pages= 698–711 |year=1968|doi= 10.1063/1.1664631|title= Stability of Matter. II|bibcode = 1968JMP.....9..698L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= E. H. Lieb, W. Thirring|journal=[[Phys. Rev.

In [[condensed matter physics]], Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the [[Ising model]] in 1 dimension and [[spin wave]]s.&lt;ref name=SelectedPapers&gt;F. J. Dyson, E. H. Lieb, ''Selected papers by Freeman Dyson'', AMS (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and [[Random matrix|random matrices]].&lt;ref name="SelectedPapers" /&gt; There is an interesting story involving random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture|pair correlation conjecture]] concerning the distribution of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. He showed his formula to the mathematician [[Atle Selberg]] who said it looked like something in [[mathematical physics]] and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the [[pair correlation function]] of the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]], which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the [[distribution of primes]] 2,3,5,7,11,&amp;nbsp; ... and the energy levels in the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[heavy elements]] such as [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Derbyshire]], ''[[Prime Obsession]]'', 2004, {{ISBN|0309085497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1979, Dyson worked with the [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities|Institute for Energy Analysis]] on [[Climatology|climate studies]]. This group, under the direction of [[Alvin Weinberg]], pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, he worked on climate studies conducted by the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] defense advisory group.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|access-date=2011-12-19|title=InterViews Freeman Dyson|date=2004-07-23|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035534/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Dyson joined the board of the [[Solar Electric Light Fund]]. {{As of|2003}} he was president of the [[Space Studies Institute]], the space research organization founded by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]; {{as of|2013}} he is on its Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssi.org/about/ssi-officers-and-board/|title=Officers and Board|publisher=Space Studies Institute|access-date=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson is a long-time member of the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] group.

Dyson has won numerous scientific awards but never a [[Nobel Prize]]. Nobel physics laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] has said that the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel committee]] has "fleeced" Dyson, but Dyson himself remarked in 2009, "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years.

===Biotechnology and genetic engineering===
{{quote|My book ''[[The Sun, the Genome and the Internet|The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet]]'' (1999) describes a vision of green technology enriching villages all over the world and halting the migration from villages to megacities. The three components of the vision are all essential: the sun to provide energy where it is needed, the genome to provide plants that can convert sunlight into chemical fuels cheaply and efficiently, the Internet to end the intellectual and economic isolation of rural populations. With all three components in place, every village in Africa could enjoy its fair share of the blessings of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.

Dyson cheerfully admits his record as a prophet is mixed, but "it is better to be wrong than to be vague."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1999) ''The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet''&lt;/ref&gt;

"To answer the world's material needs, technology has to be not only beautiful but also cheap."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Greening of the Galaxy" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Origin of Life''===
Dyson favors the dual origin concept: Life first formed cells, then enzymes, and finally, much later, genes. This was first propounded by the Russian [[Alexander Oparin]].&lt;ref&gt;Oparin, A. I. ''The Origin of Life'', Moscow Worker publisher, 1924 (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] developed the same theory independently.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of Life'', J.B.S.Haldane, The Rationalist Annual, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson has simplified things by saying simply that life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. He regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process, because of the biochemistry. Current cells contain [[adenosine triphosphate]] or ATP and [[adenosine 5'-monophosphate]] or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposes that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication were invented accidentally because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggests that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]]'s experiment and produced RNA.

Unfortunately there is no direct evidence for the dual origin concept, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these "little city economies" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''Origins of Life,,. Second Edition'', Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dyson rings.PNG|thumb|Artist's concept of Dyson rings, forming a stable [[Dyson Sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson swarm]], or "Dyson sphere"]]

===Dyson sphere===
{{Main|Dyson sphere}}
{{quote|One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |title=Freeman Dyson: Imagine … |interviewer=Monte Davis |date=October 1978 |work=[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]] |access-date=2006-12-17 |deadurl=usurped |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981207065016/http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |archivedate=1998-12-07 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1960, Dyson wrote a short paper for the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', titled "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation| doi=10.1126/science.131.3414.1667| journal=Science| volume= 131| pages= 1667–1668| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| date=3 June 1960| issue=3414| pmid=17780673| bibcode= 1960Sci...131.1667D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he theorized that a technologically advanced [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilization]] might completely surround its native star with artificial structures in order to maximize the capture of the star's available energy. Eventually, the civilization would completely enclose the star, intercepting [[electromagnetic radiation]] with wavelengths from visible light downwards and radiating waste heat outwards as [[infrared]] radiation. Therefore, one method of [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|searching for extraterrestrial civilizations]] would be to look for large objects radiating in the infrared range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Dyson conceived that such structures would be clouds of [[asteroid]]-sized [[space habitat]]s, though [[science fiction]] writers have preferred a solid structure: either way, such an artifact is often called a [[Dyson sphere]], although Dyson used the term "shell". Dyson says that he used the term "artificial biosphere" in the article meaning a habitat, not a shape.&lt;ref&gt;20 minutes into [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=350379535220823176&amp;q=genome a video]&lt;/ref&gt; The general concept of such an energy-transferring shell had been advanced decades earlier by author [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his 1937 novel ''[[Star Maker]]'', a source that Dyson has credited publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Living Through Four Revolutions |first = Freeman | last = Dyson | event = Perimeter Institute Public Lecture Series | location = Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | date = 1 June 2011 | url = https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/living-through-four-revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 211, "Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere. In fact, I took the idea from Olaf Stapledon, one of their own colleagues"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson tree===
{{Main|Dyson tree}}

Dyson has also proposed the creation of a ''Dyson tree'', a [[genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] plant capable of growing on a [[comet]]. He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a breathable atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer [[Solar System]].

{{quote|Plants could grow greenhouses ... just as turtles grow shells and polar bears grow fur and polyps build coral reefs in tropical seas. These plants could keep warm by the light from a distant Sun and conserve the oxygen that they produce by photosynthesis. The greenhouse would consist of a thick skin providing thermal insulation, with small transparent windows to admit sunlight. Outside the skin would be an array of simple lenses, focusing sunlight through the windows into the interior ... Groups of greenhouses could grow together to form extended habitats for other species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish&gt;Dyson, FJ, "Warm-blooded plants and freeze-dried fish: the future of space exploration. Played" The Atlantic Monthly, November 1997 [https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97nov/space.htm#Dyson Subscribers only]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Space colonies===
{{quote|I've done some historical research on the costs of the Mayflower's voyage, and on the Mormons' emigration to Utah, and I think it's possible to go into space on a much smaller scale. A cost on the order of $40,000 per person [1978 dollars, $143,254 in 2013 dollars] would be the target to shoot for; in terms of real wages, that would make it comparable to the colonization of America. Unless it's brought down to that level it's not really interesting to me, because otherwise it would be a luxury that only governments could afford.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

Dyson has been interested in space travel since he was a child, reading such [[science fiction]] classics as [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Star Maker]]''. As a young man, he worked for [[General Atomics]] on the nuclear-powered [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion]] spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, Saturn by 1970. He's been unhappy for a quarter-century about how the government conducts space travel:
{{quote|The problem is, of course, that they can't afford to fail. The rules of the game are that you don't take a chance, because if you fail, then probably your whole program gets wiped out.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

He still hopes for cheap space travel, but is resigned to waiting for private entrepreneurs to develop something new and inexpensive.

{{quote|No law of physics or biology forbids cheap travel and settlement all over the solar system and beyond. But it is impossible to predict how long this will take. Predictions of the dates of future achievements are notoriously fallible. My guess is that the era of cheap unmanned missions will be the next fifty years, and the era of cheap manned missions will start sometime late in the twenty-first century.

Any affordable program of manned exploration must be centered in biology, and its time frame tied to the time frame of biotechnology; a hundred years, roughly the time it will take us to learn to grow warm-blooded plants, is probably reasonable.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

Dyson also proposed the use of bioengineered space colonies to colonize the Kuiper Belt on the outer edge of our Solar System. He proposed that habitats could be grown from space hardened spores. The colonies could then be warmed by large reflector plant leaves that could focus the dim, distant sunlight back on the growing colony. This was illustrated by Pat Rawlings on the cover of the National Space Society's Ad Astra magazine.

===Space exploration===
{{quote|A direct search for life in Europa's ocean would today be prohibitively expensive. Impacts on Europa give us an easier way to look for evidence of life there. Every time a major impact occurs on Europa, a vast quantity of water is splashed from the ocean into the space around Jupiter. Some of the water evaporates, and some condenses into snow. Creatures living in the water far enough from the impact have a chance of being splashed intact into space and quickly freeze-dried. Therefore, an easy way to look for evidence of life in Europa's ocean is to look for freeze-dried fish in the ring of space debris orbiting Jupiter.

Freeze-dried fish orbiting Jupiter is a fanciful notion, but nature in the biological realm has a tendency to be fanciful. Nature is usually more imaginative than we are. ... To have the best chance of success, we should keep our eyes open for all possibilities.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

===Dyson's eternal intelligence===
{{Main|Dyson's eternal intelligence}}
Dyson's proposal that intelligent beings may be capable of thinking an infinite number of thoughts in an open/ expanding universe.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, [http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/dyson.txt "Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe,"] ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', Vol. 51, Issue 3 (July 1979), pp. 447-460; {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson's transform===
{{Main|Dyson's transform}}
Dyson also has some credits in pure mathematics. His concept "Dyson's transform" led to one of the most important [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] of [[Olivier Ramaré]]'s theorem that every even integer can be written as a sum of no more than six primes.

===Dyson series===
The [[Dyson series]], the formal solution of an explicitly time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] by iteration, and the corresponding Dyson time-ordering operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T\,,&lt;/math&gt; an entity of basic importance in the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], are also named after Dyson.

[[File:Freeman dyson.jpg|thumb|upright|Freeman Dyson in 2007 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] ]]

===Quantum physics and prime numbers===
Dyson and [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] discovered together an intriguing connection between quantum physics and [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture]] about the zeros of the Zeta function. The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... are described by the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = Freeman J. | year = 1962 | title = A Brownian?Motion Model for the Eigenvalues of a Random Matrix | url = | journal = J. Math. Phys. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| page = 1191 | doi = 10.1063/1.1703862 |bibcode = 1962JMP.....3.1191D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What Montgomery and Dyson discovered is that the ''[[eigenvalues]]'' of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the Zeta function. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his  [[Odlyzko–Schönhage algorithm]] to calculate many zeros. Dyson recognized this connection because of a number-theory question Montgomery asked him. Dyson had published results in [[number theory]] in 1947, while a Fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and so was able to understand Montgomery's question. If Montgomery had not been visiting the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] that week, this connection might not have been discovered.

There are in nature one, two, and three dimensional [[quasicrystals]]. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose [[Fourier transform]] is also a set of discrete points. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has done extensive computations of the Fourier transform of the nontrivial zeros of the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and they seem to form a one dimensional quasicrystal. This would in fact follow from the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, Selected papers, 1990-2014, pp. 41–42, World Scientific, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Metaphysics===
Dyson has suggested a kind of cosmic metaphysics of [[mind]]. In his book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'' he writes about three levels of mind: "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level is the level of elementary physical processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is ... constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. ... The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. ... [I]t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. If we believe in this mental component and call it God, then we can say that we are small pieces of God's mental apparatus" (p.&amp;nbsp;297).

===Climate change===
Dyson agrees that anthropogenic [[global warming]] exists. While he agrees that "[one] of the main causes of warming is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from our burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal and natural gas",&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dysonf07/dysonf07_index.html|publisher=Edge|title=Heretical Thoughts about Science and Society|date=8 August 2007|author=Freeman Dyson|access-date=2007-09-05}}dl&lt;/ref&gt; he believes that existing simulation models of climate fail to account for some important factors, and hence the results will contain too much error to reliably predict future trends:

{{quote|The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics, and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans. They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests. They do not begin to describe the real world we live in&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;}}

and, in 2009:

{{quote|What has happened in the past 10 years is that the discrepancies between what's observed and what's predicted have become much stronger. It's clear now the models are wrong, but it wasn't so clear 10 years ago.&lt;ref name=dy8&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/11/freeman_dyson_interview/ "Top boffin Freeman Dyson on climate change, interstellar travel, fusion, and more"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[The Register]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He is among signatories of a letter to the UN criticizing the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |title=Don't fight, adapt |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |dead-url=yes |access-date=19 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911074152/http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |archivedate=11 September 2016 |df=dmy }} Open Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

"[H]eretics who question the dogmas are needed&amp;nbsp; ... I am proud to be a heretic. The world always needs heretics to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies."&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;

Dyson says his views on global warming have been strongly criticized. In reply, he notes that "[m]y objections to the global warming propaganda are not so much over the technical facts, about which I do not know much, but it's rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have."&lt;ref name=e360&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090608114821/http://www.e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2151 "Freeman Dyson Takes On The Climate Establishment"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[Yale University]]'s ''Environment 360''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he endorsed the now common usage of "global warming" as synonymous with global anthropogenic climate change, referring to "measurements that transformed global warming from a vague theoretical speculation into a precise observational science."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (12 June 2008) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21494 "The Question of Global Warming"], The New York Review of Books. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has, however, argued that political efforts to reduce the causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority:

{{quote|I'm not saying the warming doesn't cause problems, obviously it does. Obviously we should be trying to understand it. I'm saying that the problems are being grossly exaggerated. They take away money and attention from other problems that are much more urgent and important. Poverty, infectious diseases, public education and public health. Not to mention the preservation of living creatures on land and in the oceans.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831094244/http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|archivedate=31 August 2006 |url=http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|title= University of Michigan 2005 Winter Commencement Address|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an opinion piece in the Boston Globe of 3 Dec 2015 he wrote,

{{quote|[T]he environmental movement [has been] hijacked by a bunch of climate fanatics, who have captured the attention of the public with scare stories. ...

China and India have a simple choice to make. Either they get rich [by burning prodigious quantities of coal and causing] a major increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or they stay poor. I hope they choose to get rich. ...

The good news is that the main effect of carbon dioxide ... is to make the planet greener, [by] feeding the growth of green plants of all kinds [and] increasing the fertility of farms and fields and forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyson|first1=Freeman|title=Misunderstandings, questionable beliefs mar Paris climate talks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/12/03/freeman-dyson-misunderstandings-questionable-beliefs-mar-paris-climate-talks/vG3oBrbmcZlv2m22DTNjMP/story.html|access-date=7 December 2015|publisher=''Boston Globe''|date=3 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since originally taking interest in climate studies in the 1970s, Dyson has suggested that [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the atmosphere could be controlled by planting fast-growing trees. He calculates that it would take a trillion trees to remove all carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, "Can we control the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?", Energy, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1977, Pages 287–291. {{doi|10.1016/0360-5442(77)90033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;

In a 2014 interview, he said that "What I'm convinced of is that we don't understand climate ...  It will take a lot of very hard work before that question is settled."&lt;ref name=wired20140331&gt;

===Nuclear winter===
From his 1988 book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'', he offered some criticism of then current models predicting a devastating [[nuclear winter]] in the event of a large-scale nuclear war:

{{quote|As a scientist I want to rip the theory of nuclear winter apart, but as a human being I want to believe it.  This is one of the rare instances of a genuine conflict between the demands of science and the demands of humanity.  As a scientist, I judge the nuclear winter theory to be a sloppy piece of work, full of gaps and unjustified assumptions.  As a human being, I hope fervently that it is right.  Here is a real and uncomfortable dilemma.  What does a scientist do when science and humanity pull in opposite directions?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Freeman J. Dyson|title=Infinite in All Directions: Gifford Lectures Given at Aberdeen, Scotland April—November 1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca3OH0a4tZoC&amp;pg=PA259|access-date=8 October 2011|date=22 July 2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-072889-2|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Warfare and weapons===

At the [[British Bomber Command]], Dyson and colleagues proposed removing two gun turrets from the RAF [[Lancaster bomber]]s, to cut the catastrophic losses due to German fighters in the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Battle of Berlin]]. A Lancaster without turrets could fly {{convert|50|mph|-1|abbr=on}} faster and be much more maneuverable.

{{quote|All our advice to the commander in chief [went] through the chief of our section, who was a career civil servant. His guiding principle was to tell the commander in chief things that the commander in chief liked to hear ... To push the idea of ripping out gun turrets, against the official mythology of the gallant gunner defending his crew mates ... was not the kind of suggestion the commander in chief liked to hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Children's Crusade" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On hearing the news of the bombing of [[Hiroshima]]:

{{quote|I agreed emphatically with [[Henry Stimson]]. Once we had got ourselves into the business of bombing cities, we might as well do the job competently and get it over with. I felt better that morning than I had felt for years ... Those fellows who had built the atomic bombs obviously knew their stuff ... Later, much later, I would remember [the downside].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Blood of a Poet" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|I am convinced that to avoid nuclear war it is not sufficient to be afraid of it. It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand. And the first step in understanding is to recognize that the problem of nuclear war is basically not technical but human and historical. If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the [[Vietnam War]]. When a general said in a meeting, "I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Ethics of Defense" in ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, ''Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia'', published by the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], was obtained, with some redactions, by the [[Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability]] under the [[Freedom of Information act]] in 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Dyson, R. Gomer, S. Weinberg, S.C. Wright [http://nautilus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tactical_nukes_vietnam.pdf "Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia"] (March 1967) [declassified December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the [[Dick Cavett show]] that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because "our targets were large and theirs were small." (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.)

Dyson opposed the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]]. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 US presidential election]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described him as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]].&lt;ref name=civil /&gt; He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote a strongly supportive letter to Obama regarding his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.&lt;ref name = "29 support letter"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Broad | first = William J. | date = 8 August 2015 | title = 29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html | work = The New York Times | access-date = 9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil defence===
While teaching for a few weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defence authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]], since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) "Shelters" in ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of failure===
{{quote|You can't possibly get a good technology going without an enormous number of failures. It's a universal rule. If you look at [[bicycles]], there were thousands of weird models built and tried before they found the one that really worked. You could never design a bicycle theoretically. Even now, after we've been building them for 100 years, it's very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works – it's even difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial and error, we found out how to do it, and the error was essential.&lt;ref name=BrandInterview&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/dyson.html?pg=7&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= Interview by Stewart Brand, February 1998]. [[Wired.com]] (2009-01-04). Retrieved on January 07, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===On English academics===
{{quote|My view of the prevalence of doom-and-gloom in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] is that it is a result of the English class system.  In England there were always two sharply opposed middle classes, the academic middle class and the commercial middle class. In the nineteenth century, the academic middle class won the battle for power and status.  As a child of the academic middle class, I learned to look on the commercial middle class with loathing and contempt.  Then came the triumph of [[Margaret Thatcher]], which was also the revenge of the commercial middle class.  The academics lost their power and prestige and the business people took over. The academics never forgave Thatcher and have been gloomy ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703082513/http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 July 2007|

===Science and religion===
He is a [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational Christian]] and has attended various churches from [[Presbyterian]] to [[Roman Catholic]]. Regarding doctrinal or [[Christological]] issues, he has said, "I am neither a saint nor a theologian. To me, good works are more important than theology."&lt;ref name="edge68.html"&gt;{{cite speech |url=https://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge68.html |author= Freeman Dyson |event=Templeton Prize Lecture |title=Progress In Religion |via=[[Edge.org]] |date=15 March 2000 |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Science and religion are two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here. The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.

Trouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.&lt;ref name="edge68.html" /&gt;}}

Dyson partially disagrees with the famous remark by his fellow physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] that "With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion."&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html"&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion from the Outside |author=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19090 |date=22 June 2006 |work=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Weinberg's statement is true as far as it goes, but it is not the  whole truth. To make it the whole truth, we must add an additional clause: "And for bad people to do good things—that [also] takes religion." The main point of Christianity is that it is a religion for sinners. Jesus made that very clear. When the Pharisees asked his disciples, "Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?" he said, "I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance." Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things.&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html" /&gt;}}

While Dyson has labeled himself a Christian, he identifies himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Back to Hell |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781591608158 |author=Moses Gbenu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8aLHpyW7vEC&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=110 |quote=The cash part of this award is over $1 million. Three facts are significant about this award. First, the same award was given to an agnostic Mathematician Freeman Dyson, the Buddhist Dalai Lama, Mother Theresa, and Charles R. Filmore, son of the founder of the mind-science cult, Unity. |access-date=15 February 2014 |date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Species of Origins: America's Search for a Creation Story |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9780742507654 |author1=Karl Giberson |author2=Donald A. Yerxa |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BXt7khUslccC&amp;pg=PA141 |page=141 |quote=Dyson is not a hard-nosed materialist and, in fact, criticizes his colleagues who champion that viewpoint. Officially, he calls himself an agnostic, but his writings make it clear that his agnosticism is tinged with something akin to deism. |access-date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, here is a passage from Dyson's review of ''The God of Hope and the End of the World'' from [[John Polkinghorne]]:

{{quote|I am myself a Christian, a member of a community that preserves an ancient heritage of great literature and great music, provides help and counsel to young and old when they are in trouble, educates children in moral responsibility, and worships God in its own fashion. But I find Polkinghorne's theology altogether too narrow for my taste. I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian. To me, to worship God means to recognize that mind and intelligence are woven into the fabric of our universe in a way that altogether surpasses our comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science &amp; Religion: No Ends in Sight |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/mar/28/science-religion-no-ends-in-sight/ |work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=30 July 2012|author=Freeman Dyson|date=28 March 2002|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] criticized Dyson for accepting the religious [[Templeton Prize]] in 2000; "It would be taken as an endorsement of religion by one of the world's most distinguished physicists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Bantam Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-61868-000-9|page=152|title-link=The God Delusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dyson declared in 2000 that he is a (non-denominational) Christian,&lt;ref name="edge68.html"/&gt; and he has disagreed with Dawkins on several occasions, as when he criticized Dawkins' understanding of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=John Brockman |url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/dawkins_dyson.html |title=Richard Dawkins—Freeman Dyson: an exchange |year=2007 |website=[[Edge.org]]|access-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[feminist philosophy]] journal [[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|''Hypatia'']] became involved in a dispute in April 2017 that led to the [[online shaming]] of one of its authors, Rebecca Tuvel, a Canadian [[Academic tenure|untenured]] [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at [[Rhodes College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017&gt;[[Rogers Brubaker|Brubaker, Rogers]] (18 May 2017). [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/the-uproar-over-transracialism.html "The Uproar Over 'Transracialism'"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal had published a [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] article by Tuvel in which she compared aspects of the situation of [[Caitlyn Jenner]], a [[trans woman]], to that of [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies as black. When the article was criticized on [[social media]], scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and urged the journal to retract it.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017&gt;Singal, Jesse (2 May 2017). [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html "This Is What a Modern-Day Witch Hunt Looks Like"], ''New York'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy exposed a rift within the journal's editorial team and more broadly within [[feminism]] and academic [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

In the article—"In Defense of Transracialism", published in ''Hypatia''{{'}}s spring 2017 issue on 25 April—Tuvel argued that "[s]ince we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuvel|first=Rebecca|date=Spring 2017|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/pdf|title=In Defense of Transracialism|work=Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=(263–278), 264|doi-access=free|doi=10.1111/hypa.12327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510220050/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/full|archive-date=10 May 2017|dead-url=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, a small group on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]  began criticizing the article and attacking Tuvel. From 29 April an open letter, naming a member of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial board as its point of contact, urged that the article be retracted. The article's publication had sent a message, the letter said, that "white [[Cisgender|cis]] scholars may engage in speculative discussion of these themes" without engaging "theorists whose lives are most directly affected by [[transphobia]] and [[racism]]".&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

On 1 May a post appeared on the journal's Facebook page apologizing for the article's publication, on behalf of "a majority" of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s associate editors.&lt;ref name=Heyes30April2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; By the following day the open letter had 830 signatories,&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt; including scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' and two members of Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]].

===Jenner and Dolezal===
Tuvel began writing the article after noticing the contrast, in 2015, between the reception given to [[Caitlyn Jenner]]'s coming out as a [[trans woman]] in April and that given in June to [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies and had been [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]] as black. Jenner became one of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine's Women of the Year and appeared on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', while Dolezal lost her position as president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] chapter in [[Spokane]], Washington, and became, in her view, unemployable.&lt;ref&gt;Engber, Daniel (30 May 2017).

Woman's Story Stirs Up a Furor"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel was not interested in the details of the cases but in their structure. She set about writing an argument in support of the position: "Since we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

===Arguments===

Tuvel suggests that "[g]enerally, we treat people wrongly when we block them from assuming the personal identity they wish to assume." As an example, she offers [[conversion to Judaism]]. Assuming there is no reason to block the conversion, such as the rabbi doubting the seriousness of the commitment, transition to the new identity will be accepted. Self-identification and social recognition of the new identity are the two components needed for a successful change.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

Tuvel then argues for "an account of race that allows for racial membership on the basis of social treatment and&amp;nbsp;... self-identification".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} She maintains that [[Race (human categorization)|race]] is a malleable [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and that, while [[ancestry]]—a feature external to the body—is a highly valued determinant of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race in America]], its value varies elsewhere. [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|In Brazil]], for example, Tuvel suggests that Dolezal's exposure to [[African-American culture|black culture]], self-identification as black, and living as someone society had accepted as black, would be enough to deem her black. From a genetic standpoint, there is no matter of fact, no "real race", Tuvel writes.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=266–267}}

Four objections to [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]] are addressed and rejected. The first is that a claim to be black cannot be accepted without the experience of having grown up with the suffering anti-black [[racism]] causes; Tuvel quotes the journalist [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]], who called this the "one thing that binds black people"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}; Schwartz, Ian (16 June 2015). [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/toure_roasts_rachel_dolezal_the_one_thing_that_binds_black_people_is_the_experience_of_racism.html "Toure Roasts Rachel Dolezal: "The One Thing That Binds Black People Is The Experience Of Racism"], ''RealClear Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt; That trans women are not raised with the suffering caused by [[sexism]] is not reason enough, Tuvel argues, to reject their identification as women. Following this argument, Dolezal's experience of racism while living as a black woman would be sufficient exposure.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}

The second objection holds that Dolezal cannot identify as black because of the importance placed on ancestry (in America, at least). No matter the genetic facts, there is [[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] agreement that ancestry matters; it is crucial because it is regarded as crucial. Tuvel argues that this position—espoused by [[Cressida Heyes]], the associate editor who posted the apology—holds the possibility of change "hostage to the status quo". How racial categorization does operate is not necessarily how it should operate.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268–269}}

Third, there is an objection that the black community is harmed when a white individual seeks to enter that category; several commentators compared Dolezal's passing as black to the harmful practice of [[blackface]]. Tuvel distinguishes between what she calls problematic and unproblematic identification. Dolezal's self-identification is not based on a change in physical appearance alone; there is nothing obviously insulting about it; her change does not appear to be temporary; there are no questionable ends; and there is no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. It is therefore an example of unproblematic identification, Tuvel argues.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=269–270}}

A fourth objection holds that Dolezal is engaged in a "wrongful exercise of white privilege". This argument holds that a white person can restore their [[white privilege]] whenever they need it; a black person is denied this ease of movement.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}} Tuvel quotes the writer Tamara Winfrey Harris: "I will accept Ms. Dolezal as black like me only when society can accept me as white like her."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}}; Harris, Tamara Winfrey (16 June 2015). [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/rachel-dolezals-harmful-masquerade.html "Black Like Who? Rachel Dolezal’s Harmful Masquerade"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel writes that the same argument applies to trans women, especially before surgery; that someone could return to [[male privilege]] should not preclude their transition. She argues further than the exercise of privilege is a separate issue. That more men than women get jobs as philosophy professors does not mean we should get rid of philosophy professors; instead, we should address the inequality. Similarly, if society comes to accept transracialism, it could be made easier for all races to transition. Tuvel adds that it is hard to see how Dolezal could be accused of exercising white privilege by choosing to give it up.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270–271}}

Finally, Tuvel asks whether, if we accept her position, we are obliged to accept any and all self-identification, such as individuals who [[Otherkin|identify as nonhuman]]. She repeats that two components are necessary for a successful change: self-identification and social acceptance of the new identity. It is reasonable to ask that social acceptance depend on it being possible for individuals to imagine what it is like to exist and be treated as a member of the category they seek to join. Without that, there is "too little commonality to make the group designation meaningful".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=272}}

Botts was unable to attend, but she submitted a couple of paragraphs in reply to Tuvel and the panel members, arguing that the contemporary understanding of race in the United States in the 21st century is that it is an "identity marker based in ancestry", which unlike gender is not changeable; she called race "externally derived" and gender "internally derived".

Tuvel was called transphobic, racist, crazy and stupid, and was accused of having engaged in "epistemic violence".&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017&gt;[[Kelly Oliver|Oliver, Kelly]] (7 May 2017). [http://thephilosophicalsalon.com/if-this-is-feminism-its-been-hijacked-by-the-thought-police/ "If this is feminism"], ''The Philosophical Salon'' (''Los Angeles Review of Books'').&lt;/ref&gt; Several feminists referred to her as a "[[Becky (slang)|Becky]]", a pejorative sexist term.&lt;ref name=Sosis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuvel2018&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuvel|first=Rebecca|date=Winter 2018|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/C1257B82005A7B6C/file/A70140B8B305A70B8525826B006A6E2D/$FILE/philtoday_2018_0062_0001_0077_0092.pdf|title=Racial Transitions and Controversial Positions: Reply to Taylor, Gordon, Sealey, Hom, and Botts|work=Philosophy Today|volume=62|issue=1|pages=(73–88), 74|format=pdf|doi=10.5840/philtoday2018223200|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718161146/https://www.pdcnet.org/C1257B82005A7B6C/file/A70140B8B305A70B8525826B006A6E2D/$FILE/philtoday_2018_0062_0001_0077_0092.pdf |archive-date=18 July 2018 |dead-url=no|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brean, Joseph (3 May 2017).

''The National Post.&lt;/ref&gt; The article was called violent, crap and "wack shit".&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKenzie1May2017/&gt; [[Kelly Oliver]], W. Alton Jones Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt University, who chaired Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]] in 2014,&lt;ref name=PhDcommittee/&gt; made an effort on Facebook to defend Tuvel by asking for arguments rather than insults, and suggested that ''Hypatia'' invite critical responses. She was told her comments were "unforgivable", and that her suggestions were "doing violence" and triggering [[PTSD]].&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;

According to Oliver, several people associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and apologized individually for the article. A friend of Oliver's described one of the Facebook apologies as "like something ISIS makes its captors read in a hostage video before beheading them". Dissenters were shut down or afraid to speak up. Several people who wrote sympathetically to Tuvel in private attacked her in public. Others who posted criticism acknowledged privately that they had not read the article.  A "senior feminist philosopher" telephoned Tuvel to remind her that she had to appeal to the "right people" to get tenure. Oliver writes: "Through every medium imaginable, senior feminist scholars were pressuring, even ''threatening'', Tuvel that she wouldn't get tenure and her career would be ruined if she didn’t retract her article."&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt; Tuvel said that people were "absolutely vicious" toward her.&lt;ref name=Sosis/&gt;

Nora Berenstain, [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of Tennessee]], wrote on Facebook on 29 April that the paper contained "egregious levels of liberal white ignorance and discursive transmisogynistic violence".&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;{{efn|Berenstain said that the term "violence" referred to "structural violence", which she described as "a range of systemic harms that go beyond direct interpersonal physical contact".&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;}} Criticizing Tuvel for failing to cite women-of-color philosophers or black trans women, Berenstain objected to Tuvel's parenthetical reference to Jenner's former name ([[deadnaming]]), and her use of the terms "transgenderism", "biological sex" and "male genitalia". The paper's references to surgery, Berenstain wrote, objectified trans bodies, and its reference to "a male-to-female (mtf) trans individual who could return to male privilege" promoted "the harmful transmisogynistic ideology that trans women have (at some point had) male privilege".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

===Open letter===
====Signatories and objections{{anchor|Letter}}====
An open letter requesting a [[retraction]] began to circulate on 29 April 2017; its point of contact was Alexis Shotwell of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial board.&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=editorialboardJune2017/&gt; The letter had 130 signatories by 9&amp;nbsp;am on 1 May,&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; 520 later that day,&lt;ref name=letter/&gt; and 830 by the afternoon of 2 May.&lt;ref name=Piper2May2017&gt;Piper, Greg (2 May 2017). [https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/32415/ "Sorry for comparing transgenders to Rachel Dolezal, feminist journal tells outrage mob"], ''The College Fix''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Singal, the top five signatories were Elise Springer ([[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]]), Alexis Shotwell ([[Carleton University|Carleton]]), Dilek Huseyinzadegan ([[Emory University|Emory]]), [[Lori Gruen]] (Wesleyan), and Shannon Winnubst ([[Ohio State University|Ohio State]]).&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; [[Lisa Guenther]] (Vanderbilt) also signed it;&lt;ref name=Guenther2May2017&gt;{{cite news|last=Guenther|first=Lisa|author-link=Lisa Guenther|date=2 May 2017|title=This article&amp;nbsp;...|url=https://www.facebook.com/lisa.guenther.982/posts/1038183326316452|publisher=Facebook|archiveurl=https://archive.is/amyBC|archivedate=3 May 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gruen and Guenther were members of Tuvel's dissertation committee in 2014.&lt;ref name=PhDcommittee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guenther2May2017/&gt;

Delivered on 2 May to ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editor-in-chief,&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt; the letter urged the journal to retract the article; avoid deadnaming; open its editorial procedures to scrutiny; release a statement about how it plans to improve its review process; and undertake to involve in future "people targeted by transphobia and racism and scholars who specialize in the related relevant subfields of philosophy".&lt;ref name=letter/&gt; It alleged that the article had fallen "short of scholarly standards":

{{quote|1.  It uses vocabulary and frameworks not recognized, accepted, or adopted by the conventions of the relevant subfields; for example, the author uses the language of “transgenderism” and engages in [[deadnaming]] a trans woman;

2.  It mischaracterizes various theories and practices relating to religious identity and conversion; for example, the author gives an off-hand example about conversion to Judaism;

3.  It misrepresents leading accounts of belonging to a racial group; for example, the author incorrectly cites [[Charles W. Mills|Charles Mills]] as a defender of voluntary racial identification;

4.  It fails to seek out and sufficiently engage with scholarly work by those who are most vulnerable to the intersection of racial and gender oppressions (women of color) in its discussion of “transracialism”. We endorse Hypatia's stated commitment to "actively reflect and engage the diversity within feminism, the diverse experiences and situations of women, and the diverse forms that gender takes around the globe," and we find that this submission was published without being held to that commitment.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;"Open letter to Hypatia", Google Docs.

====Rebuttal====
{{Feminism sidebar}}
According to Justin Weinberg, [[associate professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of South Carolina]], and Jesse Singal of ''New York'' magazine, most of the letter's claims were false or arguable.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Regarding the term ''transgenderism'', [[GLAAD]] does caution against its use. The [[deadnaming]] consisted of Tuvel including Jenner's previous name in parentheses, a name that Jenner herself refers to, Singal wrote.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;{{efn|[[Caitlyn Jenner]] (2017): "Transgender guidelines suggest that I no longer be referred to as Bruce in any circumstance. Here are my guidelines: I will refer to the name Bruce when I think it appropriate and the name Caitlyn when I think it appropriate. Bruce existed for sixty-five years, and Caitlyn is just going on her second birthday. That's the reality."&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, Caitlyn (2017). ''The Secrets of My Life''. New York: Grand Central Publishing, vii.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Weinberg argued that it was unclear why the conversion example was deemed objectionable; it consisted of a paragraph explaining that, barring (for example) objections from the rabbi that the prospective convert is not committed to Judaism, those who wish to become Jews can do so.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} Weinberg also argued that Tuvel had not identified Charles Mills as a "defender of voluntary racial identification"; he wrote that this allegation was "just plain false".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{efn|Tuvel (2017): "Charles Mills identifies at least five categories generally relevant to the determination of racial membership, including 'self-awareness of ancestry, public awareness of ancestry, culture, experience, and self-identification' (Mills 1998, 50). If ancestry is a less emphasized feature in some places (for example, in Brazil), then Dolezal's exposure to black culture, experience living as someone read as black, and her self-identification could be sufficient to deem she is black in those places. And because there is no fact of the matter about her 'actual' race from a genetic standpoint, these features of Dolezal's experience would be decisive for determining her race in that particular context. The crucial point here is that no 'truth' about Dolezal's 'real' race would be violated."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}}}

The criticism that Tuvel had not cited enough women of color may be a fair point, according to Singal, but hardly sufficient to demand a retraction.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Weinberg argued that Tuvel's critics had failed to point out a particular work that was both directly relevant and that had been omitted.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017&gt;Justin Weinberg (1 May 2017).

===Associate editors' apology===
On 30 April 2017—two days before the open letter was delivered to ''Hypatia''—[[Cressida Heyes]], then one of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s 10 associate editors,&lt;ref name=editorialboardJune2017/&gt; posted a 1,000-word apology on her Facebook page from "We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors". The post was later removed or made private. On 1 May it was reposted to ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page, this time ending with "Sincerely, A Majority of the Hypatia's Board of Associated Editors".&lt;ref name=Heyes30April2017&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heyes |first1=Cressida |author-link=Cressida Heyes|title=To our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy |url=https://www.facebook.com/cressida.heyes/posts/10154548425035895 |publisher=Personal Facebook page|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qKlW3Fnc |archivedate=9 May 2017 |date=30 April 2017|dead-url=yes}}{{pb}}
{{cite web |last1= |first1=|title=To our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy |url=https://www.facebook.com/hypatia.editorialoffice/posts/1852550825032876 |publisher=Hypatia Facebook page|archiveurl=https://archive.is/TbVNM |archivedate=13 May 2017 |date=1 May 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; The apology stated: "We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors, extend our profound apology to our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy, especially transfeminists, queer feminists, and feminists of color, for the harms that the publication of the article on transracialism has caused":

&lt;blockquote&gt;To compare ethically the lived experience of trans people (from a distinctly external perspective) primarily to a single example of a white person claiming to have adopted a black identity creates an equivalency that fails to recognize the history of racial appropriation, while also associating trans people with racial appropriation. We recognize and mourn that these harms will disproportionately fall upon those members of our community who continue to experience marginalization and discrimination due to racism and cisnormativity.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It continued that "clearly, the article should not have been published", and blamed the review process, which had exposed Tuvel to criticism that was "both predictable and justifiable". The associate editors had been asked but declined to name the anonymous reviewers.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

==Reception==
===Author's statement===
Tuvel issued a statement, on 1 May 2017, in response to the associate editors' apology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wrote this piece from a place of support for those with non-normative identities, and frustration about the ways individuals who inhabit them are so often excoriated, body-shamed, and silenced. When the case of Rachel Dolezal surfaced, I perceived a transphobic logic that lay at the heart of the constant attacks against her. My article is an effort to extend our thinking alongside transgender theories to other non-normative possibilities.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing scholars who have adopted sympathetic positions on transracialism, including [[Adolph L. Reed Jr.]] and [[Melissa Harris-Perry]], she argued that failing to examine the issues would "reinforce gender and racial essentialism". She apologized for the parenthetical reference to Jenner's previous name,&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; which was removed from the article at her request on 4&amp;nbsp;May.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017}} She also acknowledged that "[a] valid reproach is that my article discusses the lives of vulnerable people without sufficiently citing their own first-person experiences and views." Expressing concern about the personal attacks and hate mail she had received, including from commentators who had not read the article, she wrote that commentators had warned her that failing to retract the article would "be devastating for&amp;nbsp;... [her] personally, professionally, and morally". She argued that "critical thought is in danger", and that "the last place one expects to find such calls for censorship rather than discussion is amongst philosophers".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKenzie1May2017&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (1 May 2017).

===Early response from ''Hypatia''===
[[Sally Scholz]], the journal's editor-in-chief, offered her support to Tuvel on 6 May, writing that "it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data)." The board of associate editors was a policy board with no role in the journal's management, she wrote, and it had acted independently in drafting and posting the letter.{{efn|[[Sally Scholz|Sally J. Scholz]] (6 May 2017): "As Editor of an academic journal that espouses pluralism and diversity, I believe that Hypatia should publish on a wide array of topics employing a wide array of methodologies. I believe that a community of scholars should contest concepts and engage in dialogue within the pages of the journal to advance our collective project of educating—students and ourselves. I believe that an academic journal is not a blog or a discussion board.{{pb}}"I firmly believe, and this belief will not waver, that it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data). In this respect, editors must stand behind the authors of accepted papers. That is where I stand. Professor Tuvel's paper went through the peer review process and was accepted by the reviewers and by me.{{pb}} "The Associate Editorial board acted independently in drafting and posting their statement. That board is a policy board and plays no role in the day to day management of the Journal.{{pb}} "Since April 30, I have been working with the publisher, Wiley, to respond responsibly and appropriately. We have consulted with the corporation which owns ''Hypatia'' and, together, we are proceeding to refer the situation to Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) for guidance."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;}} Scholz's position was supported by [[Miriam Solomon]], president of Hypatia Inc.'s board of directors. Scholz, the board and the publisher, John Wiley &amp; Sons, referred the matter to the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

On 18 May the board issued a statement with a mixed message.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Charlotte (18 May 2017). [http://www.weeklystandard.com/finally-a-meek-and-halfhearted-defense-of-rebecca-tuvel-from-hypatia/article/2008107 "Finally, a (Meek and Halfhearted) Defense of Rebecca Tuvel from Hypatia"], ''The Weekly Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt; Signed by [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]], [[Leslie Francis]] (treasurer), Heidi Grasswick (secretary), Solomon (president), and [[Lisa Tessman]] (chair), it acknowledged the "intensity of experience and convictions around matters of intersectionality", and the "egregious history of treatment of women of color feminists and feminists from other marginalized social positions" within academic philosophy. Dismissing the view that objections to the article were too minor to have triggered such a strong response, the board wrote that such a view from "outsiders" reflects "ignorance of the cumulative history of marginalization, disrespect, and misrepresentation of oppressed groups".&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (18 May 2017). [http://www.chronicle.com/article/Journal-s-Board-Disavows/240116 "Journal's Board Disavows Apology for 'Transracialism' Article, Making Retraction Unlikely"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement continued that the associate editors had apologized without adequate consultation with the editor-in-chief and on their own behalf only. Condemning the personal attacks on Tuvel, the directors said they stood behind the editor-in-chief and that the article would not be retracted "barring discovery of misconduct or plagiarism". The associate editors' apology remained on ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page; on 25 May 2017 it was updated to say that it did not represent the views of the editor or board of directors.&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt;

===Early academic reaction===
The academic community came out in support of Tuvel, particularly on two popular philosophy blogs, Justin Weinberg's ''[[Daily Nous]]'' and [[Brian Leiter]]'s ''Leiter Reports''.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Leiter wrote that he had "never seen anything like this in academic philosophy".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Mark Newman, chair of the [[Rhodes College]] philosophy department where Tuvel teaches, expressed the department's "complete and unconditional support" for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leiter |first1=Brian |author-link=Brian Leiter|title=Philosophy Department at Rhodes College speaks out in support of Prof. Tuvel |url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |website=Leiter Reports |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725134940/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |archivedate=25 July 2018 |date=4 May 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of harm had been "twisted beyond all recognition" by the associate editors' letter, according to José Luis Bermúdez, professor of philosophy at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;Bermúdez, José Luis (5 May 2017). [https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/05/05/real-damage-done-flare-over-philosophers-journal-article-essay "Defining 'Harm' in the Tuvel Affair"], ''Inside Higher Ed''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] called the episode "a bizarre and ugly attack".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Several commentators blamed social media's [[call-out culture]] for the speed with which the dispute unfolded.&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; In the view of [[Suzanna Danuta Walters]], editor-in-chief of the feminist journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', the associate editors had undermined "the whole process of peer review and the principles of scholarly debate".&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; Dan Kaufman, professor of philosophy at [[Missouri State University]], blamed the profession's "increasing obsession with identity politics" and "purity-purges".&lt;ref&gt;Sosis, Cliff (25 January 2018). [http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/dan-kaufman/ "Interview with Dan Kaufman"], ''What Is It Like to Be a Philosopher?''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogers Brubaker]], author of ''Trans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities'' (2016), described as "epistemological insiderism" the idea that certain issues can be covered only by particular categories of scholar, and that as a white cisgender woman Tuvel had no standing to argue about transgender or transracial issues. For Brubaker, acknowledging himself as a white cisgender man, this position means not only that certain topics are too easily closed off to particular scholars, but that scholars with [[lived experience]] are expected to focus on those topics.&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017/&gt;

[[File:Sally Haslanger, May 2013 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sally Haslanger]]]]
Systemic [[sexism]] within the discipline was cited. There had been tension for some time between ''Hypatia'' and women-of-color philosophers, who believed the journal did not take their work seriously, according to [[Tina Fernandes Botts]]. Botts was critical of the ''Hypatia'' peer-review process that had allowed the paper to be published. "What you do when someone submits the paper is you find people who are experts in that area to review it," she told ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', "to make sure that it is situated within contemporary scholarly discussions. Obviously they didn’t do that."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

[[Sally Haslanger]], later appointed co-chair of ''Hypatia''{{'s}} governance task force, complained about poor working conditions and the narrow focus of philosophy journals; she wrote that there are days she can "hardly stand the arrogance, the ignorance, the complacency, in short, the bullshit, of the profession". The situation was not Tuvel's fault; she had been unfairly targeted, in Haslanger's view. Of 13,000 professional philosophers in the United States in 2013, she wrote, only 55 were black women and 30 percent of those were PhD students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Haslanger|Haslanger, Sally]] (4 May 2017).

===''Hypatia'' resignations and task force===
The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) reported in July 2017 that the associate editors' apology had been inappropriate, and that, when responding to an external complaint about a journal article, an internal inquiry should be held prior to a public response. The associate editors apparently refused to accept the report's conclusions.&lt;ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017/&gt; On 20 July ''Hypatia'' announced the resignation of Scholz, the editor-in-chief, and Shelley Wilcox, editor of Hypatia Reviews Online. They also announced that a task force would restructure the journal's governance, and that anyone holding an editorial or non-board position with ''Hypatia'' would be "required to sign a statement of adherence" to COPE guidelines.&lt;ref name=Weinberg21July2017&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinberg |first1=Justin |title=Hypatia’s Editor and Reviews Editor Resign; Authority of Associate Editors 'Temporarily Suspended' |url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |work=Daily Nous |date=21 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726135550/http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |archivedate=26 July 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resignation&gt;{{cite web |title=Board of Directors' Statement (July 20, 2017) |url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |website=Hypatia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724105806/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |date=20 July 2017|archivedate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interim&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuation of Interim Editorial Team|url=http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|publisher=Hypatia News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043838/http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|date=20 July 2017|archivedate=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg3Aug2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Further Developments at Hypatia|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/08/03/further-developments-at-hypatia/|work=Daily Nous|date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a statement from the associate editors, the board asked them, on 17 July, to resign or it would suspend the journal's governance documents, thereby removing the associate editors' authority to choose the next editor.

      <comment>Hard incompatibilism is the "bad" thing here, not giving up belief in it (what Smilansky endorses).</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">'''Illusionism''' is a [[metaphysics|metaphysical theory]] first propounded by professor Saul Smilansky of the [[University of Haifa]].  It holds that people have illusory beliefs about [[free will]].{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}  Furthermore, it holds that it is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society.{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Holroyd|2010|p=110}}  Belief in [[hard incompatibilism]], argues Smilansky, removes an individual's basis for a sense of self-worth in his or her own achievements.  It is "extremely damaging to our view of ourselves, to our sense of achievement, worth, and self-respect".{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}

Neither compatibilism nor hard determinism are the whole story, according to Smilansky, and there exists an ''ultimate perspective'' in which ''some'' parts of compatibilism are valid and ''some'' parts of hard determinism are valid.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=4}}  However, Smilansky asserts, the nature of what he terms the ''fundamental dualism'' between hard determinism and compatibilism is a morally undesirable one, in that both beliefs, in their absolute forms, have adverse consequences.  The distinctions between choice and luck made by compatibilism are important, but wholly undermined by hard determinism.  But, conversely, hard determinism undermines the morally important notions of justice and respect, leaving them nothing more than "shallow" notions.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=6}}

Smilansky's thesis is considered a radical one,{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}} and other philosophers disagree with it.  Professor [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] of Cornell University, for example, disagrees that hard incompatibilism necessarily does away with self-worth, because to a large extent that sense of self-worth isn't related to will at all, let alone to free will.  Aspects of worthiness such as natural beauty, native physical ability, and intelligence are not voluntary.{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}  Professor James Lenman of the University of Glasgow (at the time) takes a similar line, arguing that Smilansky's expression of the problems is overstated.  The problems that he presents are less fundamentally metaphysical than simply practical in nature.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=15–17}}

In India as elsewhere, [[political philosophy]] involves on the one hand speculations on the relationships between individual, society and state, and detailed treatises on the mechanics of statecraft, state policy, war and diplomacy and [[international relations]].

Contemporary Indian political philosophy is an emerging discipline garnering increasing interest with the rise of [[comparative political theory]]. The Indian political theorist Aakash Singh Rathore has been attempting to cultivate the discipline with the 2010 book ''Indian Political Thought--A Reader'' (Routledge), and the 2017 monograph ''Indian Political Theory: Laying the Groundwork for Svaraj'' (Routledge).

Currently, he is a senior associate researcher, by invitation, in the Bioethics Doctoral Program of the University of Brasília. He is best known for his works on "negative ethics" and cinema and philosophy. Other areas of philosophy that he deals with are philosophy of language, logic and Latin American philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/fundacionjaimeroca/docs/juliocabrera] ''Entrevista al Dr. Julio Cabrera'', Serie Entrevistas, Fundación Dr. Jaime Roca, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihuonline.unisinos.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4175] ''Sem grandes intuiçoes, nao há grande filosofia'', Instituto Humanitas Unisinos, number 379, November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/preview.do?metodo=apresentar&amp;id=K4781131E6] Biogram on Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/who-i-am.html] J.

== Negative ethics ==

In his book ''A Critique of Affirmative Morality (A reflection on Death, Birth and the Value of Life)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/17430/3/Livro_CritiqueAffirmativeMorality.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''A critique of affirmative morality (A reflection on death, birth and the value of life)'', Brasília: Julio Cabrera Editions, 2014 (English edition). J. Cabrera, ''Crítica de la moral afirmativa: Una reflexión sobre nacimiento, muerte y valor de la vida'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1996 (original Spanish edition).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera presents his theory about the value of human existence. Human life, for Cabrera, is "structurally negative" in that its constitutive components are inherently adverse: as prominent among them Cabrera cites loss, scarcity, [[pain]], conflicts, fragility, [[illness]], [[aging]], [[boredom]] and [[death]]. According to Cabrera they form the basic structure to human life, which he analyzes through what he calls [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], drawing freely from thinkers such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Cabrera has called his work an attempt to put together Schopenhauer and Heidegger, introducing a determinant judgement of the value of Being into the analysis of [[Dasein]], and putting morality above life, against Nietzsche. 

Cabrera develops an ethical theory, negative ethics, that is informed by this phenomenological analysis. He argues that there has been an unwarranted prejudice in ethics against non-Being, a view he calls "affirmativity". Because affirmative views take Being as good, they always view things that threaten this hegemony as bad; particularly things like abstention from [[procreation]] or [[suicide]]. Cabrera criticizes affirmative ethics for asking how people should live without asking the radical question of whether people should live tout court. He argues that, because of the structural negativity of Being, there is a fundamental "moral disqualification" of human beings due to the impossibility of nonharming and nonmanipulating others. Nonharming and nonmanipulating others is called by him the "fundamental ethical articulation" ("FEA"). The FEA is violated by our structural "moral impediment", by the worldly discomforts – notably pain and discouragement – imposed on us that prevent us from acting ethically. Cabrera argues that an affirmative morality is a self-contradiction because it conceives a human existence that precludes the possibility of not-harming or not-manipulating others. Thus he believes that affirmative societies, through their politics, require the common suspension of the FEA to even function.

As a response to the negative structure of Being, Cabrera's negative ethics is acutely aware of the morally disqualifying nature of Being. Cabrera believes children are usually considered as mere aesthetic objects, are not created for their own sake but for the sake of their parents, and are thrown into a structurally negative life by the act of procreation. Procreation is, as Cabrera argues, a supreme act of manipulation, a harm  and a violation of autonomy. He argues that the consistent application of normal moral concepts – like duty, virtue or respect – present in most affirmative moralities entails [[antinatalism]]. Cabrera also believes that a human being adopting negative ethics should not only abstain from procreation, but also should have a complete willingness for an ethical death, by immediate suspension of all personal projects in benefit of a political fight&lt;ref name=autoname1&gt;J.

(Mi encuentro con Enrique Dussel)'', Essay 9 in: ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or an altruistic suicide, when it becomes the least immoral course of action.

Cabrera’s ''Critique'' is one of his most systematic defenses of negative ethics, but he has also explored the same ideas in other works, such as ''Projeto de Ética Negativa''&lt;ref&gt;J.

== Cinema and philosophy ==

In his first book about cinema-philosophical thought, ''Cine, 100 anos de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Cine, 100 años de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1999 (second edition in 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera proposes the notion of "logopathy" (from Greek: "logos" – "reason" and "páthos" – "feelings"), that is, of "cognitive-affective concepts", treating them as capable of putting in question the traditional view of philosophy about concepts, which he calls apathetic and tied to purely [[intellectualism|intellectual]] concepts. Cabrera sustains that logopathic philosophy is of the order of meaning, and not of truth, and that it adds affective elements of judgment to these traditional intellectual view of concepts. 

Cabrera considers cinema one of the most fruitful means for the generation of concepts of a logopathic type, specifically denominated by him as "concept-image", as opposed to "concept-idea", the apathetic type of concept. He believes that cinema, by its powerful audiovisual means of expression, would provide a "superpotentiation" of conceptual possibilities, and therefore, of the establishment of the experience of the film, indispensable to the development of the concept-image, with the consequent increase of affective impact.

On the other hand, Cabrera believes that throughout history of European philosophy, at various moments, written philosophy – the opposite of visual philosophy – has also been logopathic, it has thought through affections, but without assuming it openly, while cinema usually has been seen only as a mere affective phenomenon, without relevant cognitive power. His notions of logopathy and concept-image seek to eliminate this dichotomy, pointing to the affectivity of the intellect and the cognitiveness of affections.
 
Cabrera gave continuity to the exposition of his cinema-philosophy thinking in books like ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15246/1/LIVRO_HitchcockGreenawaypelahistoria.pdf] J.

Cabrera, M. Tiburi, ''Diálogo/cinema'', São Paulo: Senac, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, where in a debate through letters with Marcia Tiburi, he discusses the subject from the perspective that, long before the invention of the cinema, philosophy was already "filming" ideas through images, and also in articles ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch''&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3003168] J.

== Philosophy of language and logic ==

For Cabrera, philosophies of language are philosophies for which language does not matter in so far as it merely conveys something, but insofar as it constitutes – and implements – concepts and structures of understanding of the world. From this large sense of the term, he identifies four philosophies of language, which are: [[analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[hermeneutic]], phenomenological and meta-critical. Looking through the prism of negativity, Cabrera shows how the four above types of philosophies of language fail at a common point: their incapacity to fight against the failures of meaning. For the analytics, the point presents itself in the “meaninglessness” of expressions which is treated as a limit beyond which one should not go. However, according to Cabrera, this analytic objectivism excludes fundamental dimensions of the problem of meaning, such as time and lived experience. Phenomenology expands the analytic semantic horizon with the dimension of [[intentionality]] (of which analytic [[intensionality]] is only an inauthentic correlate, essentially objective) without the problem of meaninglessness being tamed. It remains for phenomenology, however, the temporality and historicity that hermeneutics adds to the approach of the problem, which is called "misunderstanding". Hermeneutic falls into the basic "distortions of meanings", something stronger than "meaninglessness" and "misunderstanding", a subject of meta-critical philosophies, represented by [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx’s]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud’s]] philosophies of language. 

Cabrera strongly criticizes the analytic approach to language for its denial of everything that is not objective. But according to him, also the other philosophies of language show their faults, from phenomenology to hermeneutics and even meta-criticism harboring therapies redeeming only in an illusory manner: [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic healing]] or [[communism|communist utopia]]. Cabrera’s philosophy of language is a philosophy of confrontations between philosophies, which can only be made under the sign of resignation in finitude and negativism. He argues that not one of the kinds of philosophies of language that have been side-by-side in the last century and a half can, by itself, account for the complexity of the human. It is in this sense that, for Cabrera, all understanding is, ultimately, a self-sustaining illusion.

Logic for Cabrera is often linked to three fundamental principles: (1) The object that propositions deal with is indeterminate and general, (2) Logic applies to ordinary reasoning, albeit with some effort, and (3) Logic is formal rather than lexical, that is, based on the structural and non-semantic connections in language. Cabrera constructs his thought in this area by criticizing each of these three basic premises of the logical tradition. 

His intuition in this field of research is the same as in others: the intersections of traditions enriches thought and is essential to account for the human condition. Thus, logical formalization is important for thinking about existence, just as the issues of human existence are essential for understanding thinking and logic. This conception of philosophy owes the hardly unorthodox intersections that Cabrera did in his studies of logic, connecting [[Saul Kripke]] with Martin Heidegger, [[Immanuel Kant]] with [[John Langshaw Austin|John Austin]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Cabrera's work has the expectation of allying the formal instruments to the [[existentialism|existential]] contents of life. The critique to the alleged empty generality of logic goes in this direction as well as the proposal of a lexical logic of predicative connections, in an attempt to lend to lexical analysis a formal dimension, but loaded with content. The specific work on concept networks in lexical logic was developed in partnership with the physicist Olavo Leopoldino da Silva Filho, from the University of Brasilia.

His work on logic also proceeds to a revision of the history of logic. An outline of his version of the history of logic would be as follows: (1) [[Aristotle]], in [[syllogism|syllogisms]] and beyond, (2) The [[Plato]]nic conception of logic, (3) The logic of the connections of meanings in the [[Middle Ages]], (4) Modern criticisms of [[formal logic]]: [[Francis Bacon]], [[Rene Descartes]] and [[John Locke]], the [[scientific method]] and logic, [[analysis|philosophical analysis]] and [[heuristics]], the [[Port-Royal Logic]], (5) The case of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]: what the official history took and what it didn't analyze, (6) Formal logic, [[transcendental logic]]: [[Immanuel Kant]], (7) The logic in motion of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]: Hegelian criticism of denial, (8) [[Mill's Methods|the logic of the induction]] of [[John Stuart Mill]], (9) Three conceptions of logic in the passage from the nineteenth to the twentieth century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], logic within analysis, [[pragmatism]], and phenomenology, (10) The case of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]: what the official story took and what it didn't analyze.&lt;ref name=autoname2&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15264/1/LIVRO_MargensFilosofiasLinguagem.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Margens das filosofias da linguagem: conflitos e aproximações entre analíticas, hermenêuticas, fenomenologias e metacríticas da linguagem'', Brasília: UnB, 2003 (reprinted in 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, O.L. Da Silva Filho, ''Inferências Lexicais e Interpretação de Redes de Predicados'', Brasília: UnB, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autoname3&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Unijuí: Unijuí, 2010. (second edition in 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera also develops a negative approach to argumentation in the field of informal logic, a pessimistic parallel theory to his negative ethics. For him, an affirmative approach to argumentation is one in which philosophical problems are considered to have one solution or at least an adequate treatment amongst many others that are inadequate and wrong. In Cabrera's view, according to the affirmative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is a mistake which must be "resolved" in some way. On the other hand, according to the negative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is not a mistake, but its most natural development. The negative approach to argumentation is concerned with treating one's own position and perspective not as a unique truth, but as one of many within an extensive and complex [[holism|holistic]] web of approaches and perspectives, that speak and criticize mutually without discarding one another, although each of such positions may be fiercely maintained based on its perspective and assumptions, supported on defensible grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/philosophy-of-logic.html] J. Cabrera, ''Philosophy of logic'', ''The negative approach to argumentation''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.unisc.br/seer/index.php/signo/article/view/7990] J. Cabrera, ''Introduçao a uma abordagem negativa da argumentaçao'', Signo, Santa Cruz do Sul, volume 42, number 73, Januar/April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin American philosophy ==

Cabrera argues that there are epistemic injustices associated with the practice of philosophy in [[colonialism|colonized]] contexts such as in Latin America. In a lecture in [[Unisinos|Unisinos University]], Cabrera began to enunciate the problem of colonization in philosophy in a succinct and direct way:

{{blockquote|The problem is: they come here and talk about their problems in their language, we go there and talk about their problems in their language''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filosofojuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/08/filosofia-no-brasil.html] J. Cabrera, ''A questão da filosofia no Brasil no contexto da reflexão sobre civilização e barbárie no pensamento argentino'', lecture given at Unisinos University, 14 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A central idea he came to defend is that the current status of philosophy in many Latin American countries is a product of the way philosophy is taught, researched, and written by local institutions that are subordinate to the international scene. Professional philosophy in these countries have been developed around commenting European (and, to a lesser extent, North American) philosophers, and this emphasis has developed as a corollary of the idea that philosophy is done only with reference to European philosophers and no Latin American is encouraged to challenge this hegemony. Alongside this inhibition of Latin American philosophy is the idea that what is European is universal while what is Latin American is merely local or national. He makes a diagnosis in the form of "acervo T" ("T collection"), theses on the hegemony of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] philosophy; this collection of theses is understood by Cabrera as being tacitly adopted by most of the Latin American philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/18028/1/ARTIGO_EuropeuNaoSignificaUniversal.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Europeu não significa universal, brasileiro não significa nacional'', Brasileira de Humanidades, Nabuco, number 2, November 2014/January/February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this colonial order, Cabrera proposes and recommends several practices concerning the teaching and practice of philosophy, among them: (1) A greater attention to Latin American sources so that the history of philosophy on the continent does not continue to be ignored by local philosophers and that the work of these philosophers be as much discussed as that of European sources, (2) A stimulus to philosophy that is not from Latin America nor about Latin America, but from Latin America where the local starting point is made explicit, (3) The practice of appropriation in which philosophers from other contexts are placed in discussions of interest to Latin America. This practice can be found in important philosophical works in Latin America such as that of [[Enrique Dussel]] with which Cabrera maintained published debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dianoia.filosoficas.unam.mx/files/1913/6132/3542/DIA52_Cabrera.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Dussel y el suicídio'', Dianoia, XLIX, 52, 2004, pp. 111–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autoname1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essay 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera has defended the crossing of boundaries between traditions and has on many occasions shown the potential for fertilization stemming from the juxtaposition, friction and debate between philosophies originating from analytical and [[continental philosophy|continental]] traditions.&lt;ref name="autoname2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essays 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he extended this metaphilosophical approach in the direction of making it an element of the struggle against what he began to clearly see as the colonized state of philosophy in Latin America.

In his book ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Cabrera documents the problems of self-reliant inventive philosophy in Brazil; the book describes the environment of suppression of philosophical intuition in its many mechanisms attending to what is specific in the Brazilian colonized context.&lt;ref name="autoname3" /&gt; The book portraits what it means to philosophize from somewhere and tries to present alternatives to the philosophical commentary that can flourish even in a hostile environment. 

For Cabrera, it is important to understand from where philosophy in Latin America is made: it is made from invaded, looted, dominated countries that have been placed in intellectual subservience. He claims that this makes the philosophy produced there different from all European philosophy – and it is important to stress that no philosophy is born universal. Cabrera notes that philosophy in Brazil, especially made in departments in the academy, is particularly blind to the sources of Latin American thought, both from the classics ([[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], [[Antônio Vieira]], [[Flora Tristan]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], [[José Martí]] and [[José Enrique Rodó]]) and contemporary ([[José Carlos Mariátegui]], [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], [[Leopoldo Zea]], [[Miguel León Portilla]], [[Roberto Fernández Retamar]] and Santiago Castro-Gómez), known only in isolated expert communities. His proposition is a course in the history of thought that begins with pre-Columbian [[Amerindian]] thought and which does not pass through Europeans (nor Greeks) until the nineteenth century. The idea is to read nineteenth-century European philosophers who challenged intellectualist and Christian traditions, such as Arthur Schopenhauer, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and Friedrich Nietzsche (and their precursors [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), as influenced virtually by Amerindian ways of living and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Esboço de una introducción al pensamiento desde América Latina'', in: ''Problemas do pensamento filosófico na América Latina'', A.V. Flores, W. Frank (editors), Goiânia: Phillos, 2018, pp. 12–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lysander Spooner''' (January 19, 1808&amp;nbsp;– May 14, 1887) was an American [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]], [[essay]]ist, [[Pamphleteer|pamphlet writer]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[Jurisprudence|legal theorist]], and entrepreneur of the nineteenth century. He was a strong advocate of the labor movement and severely anti-authoritarian and individualist in his political views.

Spooner's most famous writing includes the seminal abolitionist book ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'', and ''[[No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority]]'' which opposed treason charges against secessionists. He is also known for competing with the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] with his [[American Letter Mail Company]], which closed after legal problems with the federal government.

==Life overview==
Spooner was born on a farm in [[Athol, Massachusetts]], on January 19, 1808, and died on May 14, 1887, in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker]], "Our Nestor Taken From Us."&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner advocated what he called [[Natural law|Natural Law]]{{spaced ndash}} or the "Science of Justice"{{spaced ndash}} wherein acts of initiatory [[coercion]] against individuals and their property, such as [[tax]]ation, were considered criminal because they were immoral while the so-called criminal acts that violated only man-made (arbitrary) legislation were not necessarily criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander, [https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_1/3_1_7.pdf Natural Law, or the Science of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}

===Legal career===
Spooner's activism began with his career as a lawyer, which itself violated Massachusetts law.&lt;ref&gt;p. viii, Introduction in The Lysander Spooner Reader, ed. George H. Smith, Fox and Wilkes 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner had studied law under the prominent lawyers and politicians [[John Davis (Massachusetts governor)|John Davis]] and [[Charles Allen (Massachusetts politician)|Charles Allen]], but he had never attended college.&lt;ref name=McKivigan&gt;McKivigan, John, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OeoaqhaZ-iMC&amp;pg=PA67 Abolitionism and American Law], pg. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; According to the laws of the state, college graduates were required to study with an attorney for three years, while non-graduates were required to do so for five years.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt;

With the encouragement of his legal mentors, Spooner set up his practice in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] after only three years, defying the courts.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt; He regarded the three-year privilege for college graduates as a state-sponsored discrimination against the poor and also providing a monopoly income to those who met the requirements. He argued that "no one has yet ever dared advocate, in direct terms, so monstrous a principle as that the rich ought to be protected by law from the competition of the poor".&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt; In 1836, the legislature abolished the restriction.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt; He opposed all licensing requirements for lawyers, doctors or anyone else that was prevented from being employed by such requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lysanderspooner.org/node/5 |title=Biography |publisher=LysanderSpooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630071436/http://lysanderspooner.org/node/5 |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent a person from doing business with a person without a professional license he saw as a violation of the natural [[Freedom of contract|right to contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander [https://books.google.com/books?id=L8Q7AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22lysander+spooner%22+%22natural+right+to+contract%22+license&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2#v=onepage Constitutional Law, Relative to Credit, Currency and Banking], pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

After a disappointing legal career and a failed career in real estate speculation in [[Ohio]], Spooner returned to his father's farm in 1840.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt;

===American Letter Mail Company===
Being an advocate of [[self-employment]] and opponent of government regulation of business, Spooner started his own business called [[American Letter Mail Company]] which competed with the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]]. Postal rates were notoriously high in the 1840s,&lt;ref name=Cato&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n1-1.html |title=The Challenge To The U.S. Postal Monopoly, 1839–1851 |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510175038/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n1-1.html |archivedate=May 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1844, Spooner founded the American Letter Mail Company, which had offices in various cities, including [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and New York.&lt;ref&gt;McMaster, John Bach. 1910. A History of the People of the United States. D. Appleton and Company. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps could be purchased and then attached to letters which could be sent to any of its offices. From here agents were dispatched who traveled on railroads and steamboats, and carried the letters in hand bags. Letters were transferred to messengers in the cities along the routes who then delivered the letters to the addressees.

This was a challenge to the United States Post Office's [[monopoly]].&lt;ref name="Cato" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adie, Douglas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wPmIGtrxXb0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22lysander+spooner%22+%22post+office%22+monopoly&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lysander%20spooner%22%20%22post%20office%22%20monopoly Monopoly Mail: the Privatizing United States Postal Service], pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt; As he had done when challenging the rules of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]], he published a [[pamphlet]] titled "The Unconstitutionality of the Laws of Congress Prohibiting Private Mails". Although Spooner had finally found commercial success with his mail company, legal challenges by the government eventually exhausted his financial resources. A law enacted in 1851 that strengthened the federal government's monopoly finally put him out of business. The lasting legacy of Spooner's challenge to the postal service was the three-cent stamp, adopted in response to the competition his company provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/STAMP3.htm |title=Spooner vs. U.S. Postal System |first=Lucille J. |last=Goodyear |work=''lysanderspooner.org; originally published in'' American Legion Magazine |date=January 1981 |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019155313/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/STAMP3.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolitionism==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Spooner attained his greatest fame as a figure in the abolitionist movement. His most famous work, a book titled ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'', was published in 1845. Spooner's book contributed to a controversy among abolitionists over whether the [[United States Constitution]] supported the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The "disunionist" faction, led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], argued the Constitution legally recognized and enforced the oppression of slaves (as, for example, in the provisions for the capture of fugitive slaves in Article IV, Section 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last1=Barnett |first1=Randy E. |authorlink=Randy Barnett |title=Whence Comes Section One? The Abolitionist Origins of the Fourteenth Amendment |date=2010-02-22 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1538862 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |location=Rochester, NY |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |title=Donald Yacovone, Massachusetts Historical Society: "A Covenant with Death and an Agreement with Hell" |publisher=Masshist.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229221730/http://masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |archivedate=December 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Wendell Phillips disputed Spooner's notion that any unjust law should be held legally void by judges.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Wendell.  ''[https://archive.org/details/reviewoflysander00lcphil Review of Spooner's Essay on the Unconstitutionality of Slavery]'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner challenged the claim that the text of the Constitution permitted slavery.&lt;ref name=UOS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/UnconstitutionalityOfSlaveryContents.htm |title=The Unconstitutionality of Slavery |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728111559/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/UnconstitutionalityOfSlaveryContents.htm |archivedate=July 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he recognized that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] had probably not intended to outlaw slavery when writing the Constitution, he argued that only the meaning of the text, not the private intentions of its writers, was enforceable. Spooner used a complex system of legal and natural law arguments in order to show that the clauses usually interpreted as supporting slavery did not, in fact, support it, and that several clauses of the Constitution prohibited the states from establishing slavery.&lt;ref name=UOS/&gt; Spooner's arguments were cited by other pro-Constitution abolitionists, such as [[Gerrit Smith]] and the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], which adopted it as an official text in its 1848 platform. [[Frederick Douglass]], originally a Garrisonian disunionist, later came to accept the pro-Constitution position, and cited Spooner's arguments to explain his change of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Douglass, "[[What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

From the publication of this book until 1861, Spooner actively campaigned against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lysanderspooner.org/node/7 |title=Letters by Lysander Spooner |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630074426/http://lysanderspooner.org/node/7 |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He published subsequent pamphlets on [[Jury nullification]] and other legal defenses for escaped slaves and offered his legal services, often free of charge, to fugitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2181&amp;Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, ''An Essay on the Trial by Jury'' (1852) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1850s, copies of his book were distributed to members of Congress sparking some debate over their contents. Even Senator [[Albert G. Brown|Albert Gallatin Brown]] of [[Mississippi]], a slavery proponent, praised the argument's intellectual rigor and conceded it was the most formidable legal challenge he had seen from the abolitionists to date. In 1858, Spooner circulated a "Plan for the Abolition of Slavery", calling for the use of [[guerrilla warfare]] against slaveholders by black slaves and non-slaveholding free Southerners, with aid from Northern abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/LS-PAS.htm |title=Lysander Spooner – Plan for the Abolition of Slavery |publisher=Praxeology.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner also "conspir[ed] with [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] to promote a servile insurrection in the South", and participated in an aborted plot to free Brown after his capture following the failed raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry]], [[Virginia]] (Harper's Ferry is now part of the state of [[West Virginia]]).&lt;ref name=Raico&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] (2011-03-29) [https://mises.org/daily/5088/Neither-the-Wars-Nor-the-Leaders-Were-Great Neither the Wars Nor the Leaders Were Great], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spooner had advocated the use of violence to abolish slavery, he denounced the Republicans' use of violence to prevent the Southern states from seceding during the [[American Civil War]]. He published several letters and pamphlets about the war, arguing that the Republican objective was not to eradicate slavery, but rather to preserve the Union by force. He blamed the bloodshed on Republican political leaders, such as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] and Senator [[Charles Sumner]], who often criticized slavery but would not attack it on a constitutional basis, and who pursued military policies seen as vengeful and abusive.&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2233&amp;Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, Letter to Charles Sumner (1864) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo87.html |title=Spooner's Fiery Attack on Lincolnite Hypocrisy by Thomas DiLorenzo |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date=2004-11-26 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he denounced the institution of slavery, Spooner recognized the right of the [[Confederate States of America]] to secede as the manifestation of government by consent, a constitutional and legal principle fundamental to Spooner's philosophy; the Northern states, in contrast, were trying to deny the [[Southern United States|Southerners]] that right through military force.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, pp. xvii and further&lt;/ref&gt; He "vociferously opposed the Civil War, arguing that it violated the right of the southern states to secede from a Union that no longer represented them".&lt;ref name=Raico/&gt; He believed they were attempting to restore the Southern states to the Union, against the wishes of Southerners. He argued that the right of the states to secede derives from the natural right of slaves to be free.&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org"/&gt; This argument was unpopular in the North and in the South after the War began, as it conflicted with the official position of both governments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on economics and self-employment==
Spooner believed that it was beneficial for people to be [[Self-employment|self-employed]] so that they could enjoy the full benefits of their labor rather than having to share them with an employer. He argued that various forms of government intervention in the free market made it difficult for people to start their own businesses. For one, he believed that laws against high interest rates, or [[usury]], prevented those with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] from extending credit because they could not be compensated for high risks of not being repaid: &lt;blockquote&gt;"If a man have not capital of his own, upon which to bestow his labor, it is necessary that he be allowed to obtain it on credit. And in order that he may be able to obtain it on credit, it is necessary that he be allowed to contract for such a rate of interest as will induce a man, having surplus capital, to loan it to him; for the capitalist cannot, consistently with natural law, be compelled to loan his capital against his will. All legislative restraints upon the rate of interest, are, therefore, nothing less than arbitrary and tyrannical restraints upon a man's natural capacity amid natural right to hire capital, upon which to bestow his labor...The effect of usury laws, then, is to give a monopoly of the right of borrowing money, to those few, who can offer the most approved security".&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander. 1846. ''Poverty: Its Illegal Causes and Legal Cure''. Boston: [[Bela Marsh]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Spooner also believed that government restrictions on issuance of private money made it inordinately difficult for individuals to obtain the capital on credit to start their own businesses, thereby putting them in a situation where "a very large portion of them, to save themselves from starvation, have no alternative but to sell their labor to others" and those who do employ others are only able to afford to pay "far below what the laborers could produce, [than] if they themselves had the necessary capital to work with."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland May 15, 1886&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner said that there was "a prohibitory tax – a tax of ten per cent. – on all notes issued for circulation as money, other than the notes of the United States and the national banks" which he argued caused an artificial shortage of credit, and that eliminating this tax would result in making plenty of money available for lending&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; such that: "All the great establishments, of every kind, now in the hands of a few proprietors, but employing a great number of wage labourers, would be broken up; for few or no persons, who could hire capital and do business for themselves would consent to labour for wages for another".&lt;ref&gt;quoted from Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland by Eunice Minette Schuster, ''Native American Anarchism'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarchism==
{{Libertarian socialism}}
[[George Woodcock]] describes Spooner's essays as an "eloquent elaboration" of [[Josiah Warren]] and the early American development of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon's ideas]], and associates his works with that of [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne}} p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; Woodcock also reports that both Lysander Spooner and [[William Batchelder Greene]] had been members of the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne}} p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
[[File:Lysander Spooner Grave.JPG|thumb|250px|''Spooner's tombstone, he is interred in the historic [[Forest Hills Cemetery]]'']]
Spooner continued to write and publish extensively during the decades following Reconstruction, producing works such as "Natural Law or The Science of Justice" and "Trial By Jury". In "Trial By Jury" he defended the doctrine of [[jury nullification]], which holds that in a free society a trial jury not only has the authority to rule on the facts of the case, but also on the legitimacy of the law under which the case is tried. This doctrine would further allow juries to refuse to convict if they regard the law by which they are asked to convict as illegitimate. He became associated with [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s [[anarchism|anarchist]] journal ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', which published all of his later works in serial format, and for which he wrote several editorial columns on current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uncletaz.com/liberty/spooner.html |title=Lysander Spooner, Tucker &amp; Liberty |publisher=Uncletaz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "almost all fortunes are made out of the capital and labour of other men than those who realize them. Indeed, except by his sponging capital and labour from others".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[James J. Martin|Martin, James J.]] ''Men Against the State'', pp. 173ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner died on May 14, 1887, at the age of 79 in his residence, 109 Myrtle Street, Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/OBIT.htm |title=One of the Old Guard of Abolition Heroes, Dies in His Eightieth Year After a Fortnight's Illness |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718051644/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/OBIT.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Tucker]] arranged his funeral service and wrote a "loving [[obituary]]", entitled "Our [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] Taken From Us", which appeared in ''Liberty'' on May 28, and predicted "that the name Lysander Spooner would be 'henceforth memorable among men'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]], [http://fff.org//explore-freedom/article/lysander-spooner-part-2/ Lysander Spooner, Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Spooner's influence extends to the wide range of topics he addressed during his lifetime. He is remembered primarily for his abolitionist activities and for his challenge to the [[United States Postal Service|Post Office]] monopoly, which had a lasting influence of significantly reducing postal rates.&lt;ref&gt;Krohn, Raymond James, [https://mises.org/journals/jls/21_2/21_2_3.pdf The Limits of Jacksonian Liberalism: Individualism, Dissent, and the Gospel of Andrew According to Lysander Spooner], ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Volume 21, No. 2 (Summer 2007), pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner's writings contributed to the development of both [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] and [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] political theory in the United States, and were often reprinted in early libertarian journals such as the ''Rampart Journal''&lt;ref&gt;"A Letter to Thomas F. Bayard," in ''Rampart Journal'' Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 1965), "No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority," with an introduction by James J. Martin, in ''Rampart Journal'' Vol. 1, No. 3 (Fall 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_1/3_1_7.pdf ''Natural Law, Or the Science of Justice''], reprinted in ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'' (Winter 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were also a major influence on [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] and right-libertarian law professor and legal theorist [[Randy Barnett]].

In January 2004, [[Laissez Faire Books]] established the Lysander Spooner Award for advancing the literature of liberty. The honor is awarded monthly to the most important contributions to right-libertarian literature, followed by an annual award to the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfb.com/index.php?action=help&amp;helpfile=spooneraw.html |title=Lysander Spooner Award |publisher=Lfb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, LAVA created the Lysander Spooner (Book of the Year) Award, which has been awarded annually since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;LAVA [https://web.archive.org/web/20110413234211/http://www.lava-apa.org/ The Libertarian, Agorist, Voluntaryist &amp; Anarchs Authors and Publishers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The LAVA Awards are held annually to honor excellence in books relating to the principles of liberty, with the Lysander Spooner Award being the grand prize award.

Spooner's ''The Unconstitutionality of Slavery'' was cited in the 2008 Supreme Court case ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', which struck down the federal district's ban on [[handgun]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;. Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], writing for the court, quotes Spooner as saying the [[Right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] was necessary for those who wanted to take a stand against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=District of Columbia v.

[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|350px|Different approaches toward resolving the mind–body problem]]

The '''mind–body problem''' is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically since that question presupposes an interactionist account of mind-body relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|title=Rene Descartes: The Mind-Body Distinction|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|issn=2161-0002|quote=The real distinction of mind and body based on their completely diverse natures is the root of the famous mind-body problem: how can these two substances with completely different natures causally interact so as to give rise to a human being capable of having voluntary bodily motions and sensations?|last1=Skirry|first1=Justin|accessdate=20 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144904/http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|archivedate=19 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title=Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1996 |pages=702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind–body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author=Robert M.

Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/dualism/ |date=Nov 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Avicennism|Avicennian philosophy]],&lt;ref name=Lagerlund&gt;{{cite book |title= Forming the Mind: Essays on the Internal Senses and the Mind/Body Problem from Avicenna to the Medical Enlightenment |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media]] |year= 2010 |edition=Paperback reprint of 2007 |isbn= 9048175305 |chapter=Introduction |page=3 |author=Henrik Lagerlund |editor= Henrik Lagerlund |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IV-dcQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in earlier Asian traditions. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] or [[Monism|monist]]. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. [[Monism]] maintains that there is only one unifying reality, substance or essence in terms of which everything can be explained.

Each of these categories contain numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are [[substance dualism]], which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and [[property dualism]], which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are [[physicalism]], which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; [[idealism]], which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely an illusion; and [[neutral monism]], which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. [[Psychophysical parallelism]] is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Parallelism, Psychophysical |volume=20 |page=762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]] and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas.&lt;/ref&gt; An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French [[structuralism]], and is a position that generally characterized post-war [[Continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory |author=Bryan S.

The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

An ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE open |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual’s mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

==Mind–body interaction and mental causation==
Philosophers David L. Robb and John F. Heil introduce mental causation in terms of the mind–body problem of interaction:
{{quote|Mind–body interaction has a central place in our pretheoretic conception of agency. Indeed, mental causation often figures explicitly in formulations of the mind–body problem. Some philosophers insist that the very notion of psychological explanation turns on the intelligibility of mental causation. If your mind and its states, such as your beliefs and desires, were causally isolated from your bodily behavior, then what goes on in your mind could not explain what you do. If psychological explanation goes, so do the closely related notions of agency and moral responsibility. Clearly, a good deal rides on a satisfactory solution to the problem of mental causation [and] there is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind's "causal relevance" to behavior (and to the physical world more generally) can arise.

[René Descartes] set the agenda for subsequent discussions of the mind–body relation. According to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of "substance". Bodies, he held, are spatially extended substances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are unextended, thinking, feeling substances. If minds and bodies are radically different kinds of substance, however, it is not easy to see how they "could" causally interact. [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia]] puts it forcefully to him in a 1643 letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;how the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in the body so as to perform voluntary acts—being as it is merely a conscious substance. For the determination of movement seems always to come about from the moving body's being propelled—to depend on the kind of impulse it gets from what sets it in motion, or again, on the nature and shape of this latter thing's surface. Now the first two conditions involve contact, and the third involves that the impelling thing has extension; but you utterly exclude extension from your notion of soul, and contact seems to me incompatible with a thing's being immaterial...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Elizabeth is expressing the prevailing mechanistic view as to how causation of bodies works. Causal relations countenanced by contemporary physics can take several forms, not all of which are of the push–pull variety.&lt;ref name="sep-mental-causation"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=David |last=Robb |first2=John |last2=Heil |editor=Edward N. Zalta |title=Mental Causation |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2009 |edition=Summer 2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/mental-causation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Robb and John Heil|"Mental Causation" in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''}}

Contemporary [[neurophilosopher]] Georg Northoff suggests that mental causation is compatible with classical formal and final causality.&lt;ref name=Northoff&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophy of the Brain: The Brain Problem |author=Georg Northoff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJq4QDixIg0C&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=1588114171 |year=2004 |edition=Volume 52 of Advances in Consciousness Research |pages=137–139 |quote=The restriction of causality to 'efficient causality' lead to the neglect of 'goal-orientation' since it was no longer necessary within [that] framework. Not considering 'goal-orientation' resulted in the neglect of 'embedment' and the consequential presupposition of 'isolation' with separation between brain, body, and environment. Neglecting 'embedment' lead to the equation of perception/action with sensory impression/movement which could be well accounted for by 'efficient causality'. Accordingly, since dominated by 'efficient causality', qualia and intentionality, as related to perception/action rather than to sensory impression/movement, were excluded from science and consequently regarded [as] purely philosophical problems. Analogous to 'final causes', 'formal causes' were eliminated as well. 'Efficient causality' is not compatible with 'embedded coding' [which] is necessarily tied with 'formal causality' and 'final causality'... Finally, the possibility of mental causation remains incompatible with 'efficient causality'. It can, however, be properly described by 'formal and final causality'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist, theoretical neuroscientist and philosopher, [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter J. Freeman]], suggests that explaining mind–body interaction in terms of "circular causation" is more relevant than linear causation.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Walter J Freeman |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA4 |pages=4–5, 88–90 |quote=Walter Freeman, with his usual originality, suggest that we may be looking at the whole thing in completely the wrong way when we ask whether consciousness causes or is caused by neural activity. He suggests that circular causation is a more relevant concept in this regard than linear causation. Consciousness and neural activity are certainly interdependent, but it is impossible in principle to say that either causes the other. Thus the whole concept of consciousness as agent is simply a misreading of the true situation.}} Through my readings in physics and philosophy, I learned the concept of circular causality, which invokes hierarchical interactions of immense numbers of semiautonomous elements such as neurons, which form nonlinear systems. These exchanges lead to the formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the pattern of activity of the contributing individuals. Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes. The most subtle shift is the disappearance of agency, which is equivalent to loss of Aristotle's efficient cause. The very strong appeal of agency to explain events may come from the subjective experience of cause and effect that develops early in human life, before the acquisition of language .the question I raise here is whether brains share this property with other material objects in the world. The answer I propose is that assignment of cause and effect to one's self and to others having self-awareness is entirely appropriate, but that investing insensate objects with causation is comparable to investing them with teleology and soul.
The further question is: Does it matter whether or not causality is assigned to objects? The answer is "Very much." Several examples are given of scientific errors attributed to thinking in terms of linear causality. The most important, with wide ramifications, is the assumption of universal determinacy, by which the causes of human behavior are limited to environmental and genetic factors, and the causal power of self-determination is excluded from scientific consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[neuroscience]], much has been learned about correlations between brain activity and subjective, conscious experiences. Many suggest that neuroscience will ultimately explain consciousness:
"...consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells..."&lt;ref name=Kandel&gt;{{cite book |pages= 9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9 |author=Eric R. Kandel |isbn=0393329372 |publisher=WW Norton |year=2007 |title=In Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view has been criticized because ''consciousness'' has yet to be shown to be a ''process'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wittgenstein and the Human Form of Life |author=Oswald Hanfling |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRIkWPqy-JgC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108 |pages=108–109 |isbn=0415256453 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hard problem of consciousness|"hard problem" of relating consciousness]] directly to brain activity remains elusive.&lt;ref name=Shear&gt;A term attributed to David Chalmers by {{cite book |title=Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem |editor=Jonathan Shear |author=Eugene O Mills |chapter=Giving up on the hard problem of consciousness |pages=109 |isbn=026269221X |year=1999 |publisher=MIT Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t4KNDxsj7fcC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cognitive science today gets increasingly interested in the embodiment of human perception, thinking, and action. Abstract information processing models are no longer accepted as satisfactory accounts of the human mind. Interest has shifted to interactions between the material human body and its surroundings and to the way in which such interactions shape the mind. Proponents of this approach have expressed the hope that it will ultimately dissolve the Cartesian divide between the immaterial mind and the material existence of human beings (Damasio, 1994; Gallagher, 2005). A topic that seems particularly promising for providing a bridge across the mind–body cleavage is the study of bodily actions, which are neither reflexive reactions to external stimuli nor indications of mental states, which have only arbitrary relationships to the motor features of the action (e.g., pressing a button for making a choice response). The shape, timing, and effects of such actions are inseparable from their meaning. One might say that they are loaded with mental content, which cannot be appreciated other than by studying their material features. Imitation, communicative gesturing, and tool use are examples of these kinds of actions.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg2008"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Morsella, E. |editor2=Bargh, J.A. |editor3=Gollwitzer, P.M. |first=Georg |last=Goldenberg |year=2008 |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 7, How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia |series=Social Cognition and Social Neuroscience |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195309980 |lccn=2008004997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA136 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Georg Goldenberg|"How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia" in ''Oxford Handbook of Human Action''}}

===Neurobiology and neurophilosophy===
{{main|Neurobiology|Neurophilosophy}}

A science of [[consciousness]] must explain the exact relationship between subjective conscious mental states and brain states formed by electrochemical interactions in the body, the so-called [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=Kandel2&gt;{{cite book |author=Kandel, Eric R. |year=2007 |title=In search of memory: The emergence of a new science of mind |publisher=W.

If such animals, for instance, were magically given the power of language, would their communities evolve an intelligence as subtly discriminating as ours? Will robots, once they have been endowed with sensory systems like those that provide us with experience, ever exhibit the particular traits long thought to distinguish the human mind, including the ability to think about thinking? Dennett addresses these questions from an evolutionary perspective.  Beginning with the macromolecules of DNA and RNA, the author shows how, step-by-step, animal life moved from the simple ability to respond to frequently recurring environmental conditions to much more powerful ways of beating the odds, ways of using patterns of past experience to predict the future in never-before-encountered situations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
have focused primarily on the body rather than the mind. In this context, neuronal correlates may be viewed as causing consciousness, where consciousness can be thought of as an undefined property that depends upon this [[complex systems|complex]], adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Squire |first=Larry R. |authorlink=Larry Squire |title=Fundamental neuroscience |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |year=2008 |page=1223 |isbn=0-12-374019-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it's unknown if discovering and characterizing neural correlates may eventually provide a theory of consciousness that can explain the first-person experience of these "systems", and determine whether other systems of equal complexity lack such features.

The massive parallelism of neural networks allows redundant populations of neurons to mediate the same or similar percepts. Nonetheless, it is assumed that every subjective state will have associated neural correlates, which can be manipulated to artificially inhibit or induce the subject's experience of that conscious state. The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adamantidis A.R. |author2=Zhang F. |author3=Aravanis A.M. |author4=Deisseroth K. |author5=de Lecea L. |year=2007 |title=Neural substrates of awakening probed with optogenetic control of hypocretin neurons |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; was achieved by the development of behavioral and organic models that are amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. Non-human analysis such as this, in combination with imaging of the human brain, have contributed to a robust and increasingly predictive theoretical framework.

===Arousal and content===
[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness2.jpg|thumb|right|Midline structures in the brainstem and thalamus necessary to regulate the level of brain arousal.

To be conscious ''of'' something, the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether awake or in [[REM sleep]]. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian rhythm]] but these natural cycles may be influenced by lack of sleep, alcohol and other drugs, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude required to trigger a given reaction (for example, the sound level that causes a subject to turn and look toward the source). High arousal states involve conscious states that feature specific perceptual content, planning and recollection or even fantasy. Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients with ''impaired states of consciousness'' such as the [[coma|comatose state]], the [[persistent vegetative state]], and the [[minimally conscious state]]. Here, "state" refers to different amounts of externalized, physical consciousness: ranging from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and [[general anesthesia]], to a fluctuating, minimally conscious state, such as sleep walking and [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schiff |first=Nicholas D. |date=November 2004 |contribution=The neurology of impaired consciousness: Challenges for cognitive neuroscience. |editor-last=Gazzaniga |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-link=Michael Gazzaniga |edition=3rd |title=The Cognitive Neurosciences |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-07254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in the cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==Historical background==
The following is a very brief account of some contributions to the mind–body problem.

===The Buddha===
{{See also|Gautama Buddha|Buddhism and the body|Pratītyasamutpāda}}

The Buddha (480–400 B.C.E), founder of [[Buddhism]], described the mind and the body as depending on each other in a way that two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html Nalakalapiyo Sutta: Sheaves of Reeds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503051913/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html |date=2016-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught that the world consists of mind and matter which work together, interdependently. Buddhist teachings describe the mind as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

Ultimately, the Buddha's philosophy is that both mind and forms are conditionally arising qualities of an ever-changing universe in which, when [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvāna]] is attained, all phenomenal experience ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html Rohitassa Sutta: To Rohitassa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512204617/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html |date=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[anatta|anattā]] doctrine of the Buddha, the conceptual self is a mere mental construct of an individual entity and is basically an impermanent illusion, sustained by form, sensation, perception, thought and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html The Five Aggregates: A Study Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917193707/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha argued that mentally clinging to any views will result in delusion and stress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html Sabbasava Sutta: All the Fermentations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625214552/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since, according to the Buddha, a real self (conceptual self, being the basis of standpoints and views) cannot be found when the mind has clarity.

===Plato===
{{See also|Plato|Theory of forms}}
[[Plato]] (429–347 B.C.E.) believed that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality that consists of concepts he called Forms. According to Plato, objects in our everyday world "participate in" these Forms, which confer identity and meaning to material objects. For example, a circle drawn in the sand would be a circle only because it participates in the concept of an ideal circle that exists somewhere in the world of Forms. He argued that, as the body is from the material world, the soul is from the world of Forms and is thus immortal. He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death, when it would return to the world of [[Theory of forms|Forms]]. Since the soul does not exist in time and space, as the body does, it can access universal truths. For Plato, ideas (or Forms) are the true reality, and are experienced by the soul. The body is for Plato empty in that it can not access the [[theory of forms|abstract reality]] of the world; it can only experience shadows. This is determined by Plato's essentially [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] [[epistemology]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Aristotle===
{{Main|Aristotle}}
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) ''mind'' is a faculty of the ''soul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gendlin|2012b|page=121–122}}&lt;div align=left&gt;432a1-2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=right&gt;'''Hence''' the soul is '''as''' the hand is; '''for&lt;br&gt;the hand is a tool of tools''', and&lt;br&gt;'''the nous is a form of forms'''&lt;br&gt;(ὥστε ἡ ψυχὴ ὥσπερ ἡ χείρ ἐστιν· καὶ γὰρ η χεὶρ ὄργανόν&lt;br&gt;ἐστιν ὀργάνων)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aristotle now lets this aspect of nous and hand define a new term which he does not use anywhere else, so far as I know.  The hand is “a tool of tools.” The nous is a “form of forms.” The hand and the soul are unique in this respect.  Let us see further what this means.&lt;br&gt;
Aristotle seems to say that the nous is a form, but on closer inspection we find that it is not, or at least not the usual kind.  Nous is a maker of forms.  A “form of forms” is like a tool of tools, like a living body’s organ that makes tools. Nous is certainly not itself the sort of form that it makes.  The hand is not a made tool (it would have to be made by yet another hand).&lt;br&gt;'''In Greek “tool” and “organ” are the same word.  So we see: ”In the phrase “tool of tools” the first use of the word stands for a living organ, the second for an artificially made tool.''' In II-4 he says “all natural bodies are tools (organs) of the soul’s,” (both as food and as material from which to make tools).  In English we would say that the '''hand is the organ of tools.'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1907|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/aristotledeanima005947mbp#page/n629/mode/2up p. 542]}}&lt;br&gt; '''431b230&amp;ndash;432a14.''' To sum up: the soul is in a manner the universe of things, which is made up of things sensible and things intelligible: and knowledge is in a manner identical with its object, the intelligible; sense with its object, the sensible. This statement calls for further explanation. Sense and knowledge, whether potential or actual, are distributed over things potential or actual, as the case may be. In the soul, again, the sensitive faculty and the cognitive faculty are potentially their respective objects. These objects must therefore exist in the soul, not indeed as concrete wholes, form and matter combined, which is impossible: it must be the ''forms'' of things which exist in the soul. Thus within the soul intellect is the form of forms, i.e. of intelligible forms, and sense the form of sensibles, precisely as in the body the hand is the instrument of instruments, i.e. the instrument by which other instruments are acquired.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the soul, he said:
{{quote|It is not necessary to ask whether soul and body are one, just as it is not necessary to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, nor generally whether the matter of each thing and that of which it is the matter are one. For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken of is the actuality.| ''De Anima'' ii 1, 412b6–9|}}

In the end, Aristotle saw the relation between soul and body as uncomplicated, in the same way that it is uncomplicated that a cubical shape is a property of a toy building block. The soul is a property exhibited by the body, one among many. Moreover, Aristotle proposed that when the body perishes, so does the soul, just as the shape of a building block disappears with destruction of the block.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite web |author=Shields, Christopher |title=Aristotle's Psychology |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

===Influences of Eastern monotheistic religions===
{{main|Dualistic cosmology|Gnosticism}}
In [[religious philosophy]] of Eastern monotheism, dualism denotes a [[binary opposition]] of an idea that contains two essential parts. The first formal concept of a "mind-body" split may be found in the ''"[[divinity]] - [[secularity]]"'' dualism of the ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. [[Gnosticism]] is a modern name for a variety of ancient dualistic ideas inspired by [[Judaism]] popular in the first and second century AD.  These ideas later seem to have been incorporated into  [[Galen]]'s ''"tripartite soul"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Researchgate:Galen and the tripartite soul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that led into both the Christian sentiments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Early Christian writings:Galen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in the later [[Augustinian theodicy]] and [[Avicenna]]’s  [[Platonism in Islamic Philosophy]].

===Thomas Aquinas===
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Like [[Aristotle]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) believed that the mind and the body are one, like the seal and the wax are one, and it is therefore pointless to ask whether they are one.  However, (referring to "mind" as "the soul") he asserted that the soul persists after the death of the body in spite of their unity, calling the soul "this particular thing".  Since his view was primarily theological rather than philosophical, it is impossible to fit it neatly within either the category of [[physicalist]] or [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McInerny |first1=Ralph |last2=O'Callaghan |first2=John |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2018 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/aquinas/ |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
{{Main|René Descartes}}
[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) believed that mind exerted control over the brain ''via'' the [[pineal gland]]:
{{quote|My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul, and the place in which all our thoughts are formed.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Treatise of Man''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Treatise of Man''}}{{quote|[The] mechanism of our body is so constructed that simply by this gland's being moved in any way by the soul or by any other cause, it drives the surrounding spirits towards the pores of the brain, which direct them through the nerves to the muscles; and in this way the gland makes the spirits move the limbs.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst1&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Passions of the Soul''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Passions of the Soul''}}

His posited relation between mind and body is called [[Cartesian dualism]] or [[substance dualism]]. He held that ''mind'' was distinct from ''matter'', but could influence matter. How such an interaction could be exerted remains a contentious issue.

===Kant===
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (1724–1804) beyond ''mind'' and ''matter'' there exists a world of ''a priori'' forms, which are seen as necessary preconditions for understanding. Some of these forms, space and time being examples, today seem to be pre-programmed in the brain.
{{quote|...whatever it is that impinges on us from the mind-independent world does not come located in a spatial or a temporal matrix,...The mind has two pure forms of intuition built into it to allow it to... organize this 'manifold of raw intuition'.&lt;ref name=Brook&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andrew Brook|Brook, Andrew]] |title=Kant's View of the Mind and Consciousness of Self|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

===Huxley===
{{Main|Thomas Huxley}}
For [[Thomas Huxley|Huxley]] (1825–1895) the conscious mind was a by-product of the brain that has no influence upon the brain, a so-called [[Epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenon]].
{{quote|On the epiphenomenalist view, mental events play no causal role.

===Whitehead===
{{Main|Alfred North Whitehead}}
[[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]] advocated a sophisticated form of [[panpsychism]] that has been called by [[David Ray Griffin]] ''[[Panpsychism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ronny Desmet and [[Michel Weber]] (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead.

===Popper===
{{Main|Karl Popper}}
For [[Karl Popper|Popper]] (1902–1994) there are ''three'' aspects of the mind–body problem: the worlds of matter, mind, and of the creations of the mind, such as [[mathematics]]. In his view, the third-world creations of the mind could be interpreted by the second-world mind and used to affect the first-world of matter. An example might be [[radio]], an example of the interpretation of the third-world (Maxwell's [[electromagnetic theory]]) by the second-world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world.

[[Image:Planisphæri cœleste.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the Dutch cartographer Frederik de Wit]]

'''Natural philosophy''' or '''philosophy of nature''' (from [[Latin]] ''philosophia naturalis'') was the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[nature]] and the physical [[universe]] that was dominant before the development of [[modern science]].  It is considered to be the precursor of [[natural science]].

From the ancient world, starting with [[Aristotle]], to the 19th century, the term "natural philosophy" was the common term used to describe the practice of studying nature. It was in the 19th century that the concept of "science" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as "biology" and "biologist", "physics" and "physicist" among other technical fields and titles; institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan |editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0226089282}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Newton]]'s book ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by [[Lord Kelvin]] and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]], which helped define much of modern physics, was titled ''[[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]]'' (1867).

In the [[German philosophy|German tradition]], ''Naturphilosophie'' (philosophy of nature) persisted into the 18th and 19th century as an attempt to achieve a speculative unity of [[nature]] and [[spirit]]. Some of the greatest names in German philosophy are associated with this movement, including [[Goethe]], [[Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]. ''Naturphilosophie'' was associated with Romanticism and a view that regarded the natural world as a kind of giant organism, as opposed to the philosophical approach of figures such as [[John Locke]] and [[Isaac Newton]] who espoused a more mechanical view of the world, regarding it as being like a machine.

==Origin and evolution of the term==
The term ''natural philosophy'' preceded our current ''[[natural science]]'' (i.e. empirical science). Empirical science historically developed out of [[philosophy]] or, more specifically, natural philosophy. Natural philosophy was distinguished from the other precursor of modern science, [[natural history]], in that natural philosophy involved reasoning and explanations about nature (and after [[Galileo]], [[quantitative property|quantitative]] reasoning), whereas natural history was essentially [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] and descriptive.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, natural philosophy was one of many branches of philosophy, but was not a specialized field of study. The first person appointed as a specialist in Natural Philosophy ''per se'' was [[Jacopo Zabarella]], at the [[University of Padua]] in 1577.

Modern meanings of the terms ''science'' and ''scientists'' date only to the 19th century. Before that, ''science'' was a synonym for ''knowledge'' or ''study'', in keeping with its Latin origin. The term gained its modern meaning when [[experiment]]al science and the [[scientific method]] became a specialized branch of study apart from natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;The naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] coined the word "[[scientist]]"; his earliest written use identified by the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' was in 1834.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-19th century, when it became increasingly unusual for scientists to contribute to both [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], "natural philosophy" came to mean just ''physics'', and the word is still used in that sense in degree titles at the [[University of Oxford]]{{Citation needed|reason=See talk page|date=October 2018}}. In general, chairs of Natural Philosophy established long ago at the oldest universities are nowadays occupied mainly by physics professors. Isaac Newton's book ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by [[Lord Kelvin]] and Peter Guthrie Tait, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled ''[[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]]'' (1867).

[[Greek philosophers]] defined it as the combination of beings living in the universe, ignoring things made by humans.&lt;ref name=MorenoMuñoz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org:80/educacion/9/Usr/ibjoa/Filos/tema1.html#NAT |title=Historia de la filosofía (C.O.U.) - Tema 1 |last=Moreno Muñoz |first=Miguel |date=20 September 1998 |access-date=28 June 2018 |work=Gobierno de Canarias |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923234739/http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org:80/educacion/9/Usr/ibjoa/Filos/tema1.html#NAT |archive-date=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other definition refers to [[human nature]].&lt;ref name=MorenoMuñoz/&gt;

==Scope==
In [[Plato]]'s earliest known dialogue, ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'' distinguishes between ''science'' or bodies of knowledge that produce a physical result, and those that do not.  Natural philosophy has been categorized as a theoretical rather than a practical branch of philosophy (like ethics).  Sciences that guide arts and draw on the philosophical knowledge of nature may produce practical results, but these subsidiary sciences (e.g., architecture or medicine) go beyond natural philosophy.

The study of natural philosophy seeks to explore the cosmos by any means necessary to understand the universe.  Some ideas presuppose that change is a reality.  Although this may seem obvious, there have been some philosophers who have denied the concept of metamorphosis, such as Plato's predecessor [[Parmenides]] and later Greek philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]], and perhaps some Eastern philosophers. [[George Santayana]], in his ''Scepticism and Animal Faith,'' attempted to show that the reality of change cannot be proven.  If his reasoning is sound, it follows that to be a physicist, one must restrain one's skepticism enough to trust one's senses, or else rely on [[anti-realism]].

[[René Descartes]]' [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] system of [[mind–body dualism]] describes two kinds of substance: matter and mind. According to this system, everything that is "matter" is [[determinism|deterministic]] and natural&amp;mdash;and so belongs to natural philosophy&amp;mdash;and everything that is "mind" is [[free will|volitional]] and non-natural, and falls outside the domain of philosophy of nature.

==Branches and subject matter==
Major branches of natural philosophy include [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], the study of nature on the grand scale; [[etiology]], the study of (intrinsic and sometimes extrinsic) [[cause]]s; the study of [[Chance (philosophy)|chance]], probability and randomness; the study of [[chemical element|element]]s; the study of the [[Infinity|infinite]] and the unlimited (virtual or actual); the study of [[matter]]; [[mechanics]], the study of translation of [[Philosophy of motion|motion and change]]; the study of [[nature]] or the various sources of actions; the study of natural [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]]; the study of physical [[quantity|quantities]]; the study of relations between physical entities; and the [[philosophy of space and time]]. (Adler, 1993)

== History ==
{{for|the history of natural philosophy prior to the 17th century|History of physics|History of chemistry|History of astronomy}}

Humankind's mental engagement with nature certainly predates civilization and the record of history. Philosophical, and specifically non-religious thought about the natural world, goes back to ancient Greece. These lines of thought began before Socrates, who turned from his philosophical studies from speculations about nature to a consideration of man, viz., political philosophy. The thought of early philosophers such [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Democritus]] centered on the natural world. In addition, three presocratic philosophers who lived in the Ionian town of Miletus (hence the [[Milesian School]] of philosophy,) [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], attempted to explain natural phenomena without recourse to  creation [[myth]]s involving the [[Greek gods]]. They were called the ''physikoi'' (natural philosophers,) or, as Aristotle referred to them, the ''physiologoi''. Plato followed Socrates in concentrating on man. It was Plato's student, Aristotle, who, in basing his thought on the natural world, returned empiricism to its primary place, while leaving room in the world for man.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Crowe, ''Mechanics from Aristotle to Einstein'' (Santa Fe, NM: Green Lion Press, 2007), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] observes that Aristotle was the originator of conception of nature that prevailed in the Middle Ages into the modern era:

{{Quote |The ''Physics'' is a lecture in which he seeks to determine [[Substance theory|beings]] that arise on their own, [[Natural kind|τὰ φύσει ὄντα]], with regard to their [[Ontology|being]]. Aristotelian "physics" is different from what we mean today by this word, not only to the extent that it belongs to antiquity whereas the modern physical sciences belong to [[modernity]], rather above all it is different by virtue of the fact that [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotle's "physics"]] is philosophy, whereas modern physics is a [[Positivism|positive]] science that presupposes a [[Philosophy of science|philosophy]].... This book determines the warp and woof of the whole of Western thinking, even at that place where it, as modern thinking, appears to think at odds with ancient thinking. But opposition is invariably {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a decisive, and often even perilous, dependence. Without Aristotle's ''Physics'' there would have been no Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Principle of Reason'', trans. Reginald Lilly, (Indiana University Press, 1991),  62-[https://books.google.com/books?id=rWDUmlA6M98C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 63].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', books I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |Plato's world of eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], imperfectly represented in matter by a divine [[Demiurge|Artisan]], contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic ''[[Weltanschauungen]]'', of which [[atomism]] was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent… This debate was to persist throughout the ancient world. Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from [[Epicurus]]… while the [[Stoics]] adopted a [[Teleological argument|divine teleology]]…  The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system. This was how Aristotle… when still a young acolyte of Plato, saw matters. [[Cicero]]… preserves Aristotle's own [[Allegory of the cave|cave-image]]: if [[Troglodytae|troglodytes]] were brought on a sudden into the upper world, they would immediately suppose it to have been intelligently arranged. But Aristotle grew to abandon this view; although he believes in a divine being, the [[Unmoved mover|Prime Mover]] is not the [[efficient cause]] of action in the Universe, and plays no part in constructing or arranging it... But, although he rejects the divine Artificer, Aristotle does not resort to a pure mechanism of random forces. Instead he seeks to find a middle way between the two positions, one which relies heavily on the notion of Nature, or ''[[phusis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"The world we inhabit is an orderly one, in which things generally behave in predictable ways, Aristotle argued, because every natural object has a "nature"—an attribute (associated primarily with form) that makes the object behave in its customary fashion..."&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"&gt;David C. Lindberg, ''The Beginnings of Western Science'', University of Chicago Press, 2007, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle recommended [[four causes]] as appropriate for the business of the natural philosopher, or physicist, “and if he refers his problems back to all of them, he will assign the ‘why’ in the way proper to his science—the matter, the form, the mover, [and] ‘that for the sake of which’”. While the vagaries of the material cause are subject to circumstance, the formal, efficient and final cause often coincide because in natural kinds, the mature form and [[Teleology|final cause]] are one and the same. The [[Potentiality and actuality|capacity]] to mature into a specimen of one's kind is directly acquired from “the primary source of motion”, i.e., from one's father, whose seed (''sperma'') conveys the essential nature (common to the species), as a hypothetical ''ratio''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' II.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Material cause  : An object's motion will behave in different ways depending on the [substance/essence] from which it is made. (Compare clay, steel, etc.)
; Formal cause    : An object's motion will behave in different ways depending on its material arrangement. (Compare a clay sphere, clay block, etc.)
; Efficient cause : That which caused the object to come into being; an "agent of change" or an "agent of movement". &lt;!--(Consider )--&gt;
; Final cause     : The reason that caused the object to be brought into existence. &lt;!--(Consider)--&gt;&lt;!--Not a good example?: a seed that becomes a tree.)--&gt;

&lt;!--False!: Science has always been a systematic knowledge of causes. --&gt;From the late Middle Ages into the modern era, the tendency has been to narrow "science" to the consideration of efficient or agency-based causes of a particular kind:&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Dodds, "Science, Causality and Divine Action: Classical Principles for Contemporary Challenges," ''CTNS Bulletin'' 21:1 [2001].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |The action of an efficient cause may sometimes, but not always, be described in terms of quantitative force. The action of an artist on a block of clay, for instance, can be described in terms of how many pounds of pressure per square inch is exerted on it. The efficient causality of the teacher in directing the activity of the artist, however, cannot be so described…

The final cause acts on the agent to influence or induce her to act. If the artist works "to make money," making money is in some way the cause of her action. But we cannot describe this influence in terms of quantitative force. The final cause acts, but it acts according to the mode of final causality, as an end or good that induces the efficient cause to act. The mode of causality proper to the final cause cannot itself be reduced to efficient causality, much less to the mode of efficient causality we call "force."&lt;ref&gt;Dodds 2001, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Medieval philosophy of motion===
Medieval thoughts on motion involved much of Aristotle's works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''. The issue that medieval philosophers had with motion was the inconsistency found between book 3 of ''Physics'' and book 5 of ''Metaphysics''. Aristotle claimed in book 3 of ''Physics'' that motion can be categorized by substance, quantity, quality, and place. where in book 5 of ''Metaphysics'' he stated that motion is a magnitude of quantity. This disputation led to some important questions to natural philosophers: Which category/categories does motion fit into? Is motion the same thing as a terminus? Is motion separate from real things? These questions asked by medieval philosophers tried to classify motion.&lt;ref name="Murdoch and Sylla 1978"/&gt;

William Ockham gives a good concept of motion for many people in the Middle Ages. There is an issue with the vocabulary behind motion which makes people think that there is a correlation between nouns and the qualities that make nouns. Ockham states that this distinction is what will allow people to understand motion, that motion is a property of mobiles, locations, and forms and that is all that is required to define what motion is. A famous example of this is [[Occam's razor]] which simplifies vague statements by cutting them into more descriptive examples. "Every motion derives from an agent." becomes "each thing that is moved, is moved by an agent" this makes motion a more personal quality referring to individual objects that are moved.&lt;ref name="Murdoch and Sylla 1978"&gt;John E. Murdoch and Edith D. Sylla ''Science in The Middle Ages:The Science of Motion'' (1978) University of Chicago Press p. 213-222&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle's philosophy of nature===
:::"An acorn is potentially, but not actually, an oak tree. In becoming an oak tree, it becomes actually what it originally was only potentially. This change thus involves passage from potentiality to actuality — not from non-being to being but from one kind or degree to being another"&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"/&gt;

Aristotle held many important beliefs that started a convergence of thought for natural philosophy. Aristotle believed that attributes of objects belong to the objects themselves, and share traits with other objects that fit them into a category. He uses the example of dogs to press this point. An individual dog may have very specific attributes (ex. one dog can be black and another brown) but also very general ones that classify it as a dog (ex. four-legged). This philosophy can be applied to many other objects as well. This idea is different than that of Plato, with whom Aristotle had a direct association. Aristotle argued that objects have properties "form" and something that is not part of its properties "matter" that defines the object. The form cannot be separated from the matter. Given the example that you can not separate properties and matter since this is impossible, you cannot collect properties in a pile and matter in another.&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"/&gt;

Aristotle believed that change was a natural occurrence. He used his philosophy of form and matter to argue that when something changes you change its properties without changing its matter. This change occurs by replacing certain properties with other properties. Since this change is always an intentional alteration whether by forced means or by natural ones, change is a controllable order of qualities. He argues that this happens through three categories of being: non-being, potential being, and actual being. Through these three states the process of changing an object never truly destroys an objects forms during this transition state but rather just blurs the reality between the two states. An example of this could be changing an object from red to blue with a transitional purple phase.&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"/&gt;

===Other significant figures in natural philosophy===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Early Greek philosophers studied motion and the cosmos. Figures like [[Hesiod]] regarded the Natural world as offspring of the gods, whereas others like [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] regarded the world as lifeless atoms in a vortex. [[Anaximander]] deduced that eclipses happen because of apertures in rings of celestial fire. [[Heraclitus]] believed that the heavenly bodies were made of fire that were contained within bowls. He thought that eclipses happen when the bowl turned away from the earth. [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] is believed to have stated that an underlying element was air, and by manipulating air someone could change its thickness to create fire, water, dirt, and stones. [[Empedocles]] identified the elements that make up the world which he termed the roots of all things as Fire, Air. Earth, and Water. [[Parmenides]] argued that all change is a logical impossibility. He gives the example that nothing can go from nonexistence to existence. [[Plato]] argues that the world is an imperfect replica of an idea that a divine craftsman once held. He also believed that the only way to truly know something was through reason and logic not the study of the object itself, but that changeable matter is a viable course of study.&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"/&gt;

The [[scientific method]] has ancient precedents and [[Galileo]] exemplifies a mathematical understanding of nature which is the hallmark of modern natural scientists. Galileo proposed that objects falling regardless of their mass would fall at the same rate, as long as the medium they fall in is identical. The 19th-century distinction of a scientific enterprise apart from traditional natural philosophy has its roots in prior centuries. Proposals for a more "inquisitive" and practical approach to the study of nature are notable in [[Francis Bacon]], whose ardent convictions did much to popularize his insightful [[Baconian method]]. The late 17th-century natural philosopher [[Robert Boyle]] wrote a seminal work on the distinction between [[physics]] and [[metaphysics]] called, ''A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature'', as well as ''The Skeptical Chymist'', after which the modern science of [[chemistry]] is named, (as distinct from [[proto-science|proto-scientific]] studies of [[alchemy]]). These works of natural philosophy are representative of a departure from the [[medieval]] [[scholasticism]] taught in European [[universities]], and anticipate in many ways, the developments which would [[history of science|lead to science]] as practiced in the modern sense. As Bacon would say, "vexing nature" to reveal "her" secrets, ([[scientific experiment]]ation), rather than a mere reliance on largely historical, even [[anecdotal]], [[observation]]s of empirical [[phenomena]], would come to be regarded as a defining characteristic of [[modern science]], if not the very key to its success.

Sometimes we mean by the ''nature'' of a thing the ''[[essence]]'', or that which the schoolmen scruple not to call the ''[[quiddity]]'' of a thing, namely, the ''[[property (philosophy)|attribute]]'' or ''attributes'' on whose score it is what it is, whether the thing be [[matter|corporeal]] or not, as when we attempt to define the ''nature'' of an ''[[angel]]'', or of a ''[[triangle]]'', or of a ''[[fluid]]'' body, as such. Sometimes we take ''nature'' for an internal principle of [[motion (physics)|motion]], as when we say that a stone let fall in the [[air (classical element)|air]] is by ''nature'' carried towards the centre of the [[earth (classical element)|earth]], and, on the contrary, that [[fire (classical element)|fire]] or flame does ''naturally'' move upwards toward [[firmament|heaven]].

Natural philosophers of the late 17th or early 18th century were sometimes insultingly described as 'projectors'. A [[projector (early scientist)|projector]] was an entrepreneur who invited people to invest in his invention but - as the caricature went - could not be trusted, usually because his device was impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-keller/age-projectors|title=The Age of the Projectors {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Swift satirized natural philosophers of the [[Royal Society]] as 'the academy of projectors' in his novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]].'' Historians of science have argued that natural philosophers and the so-called projectors sometimes overlapped in their methods and aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ku2IWu3xchoC&amp;dq=alex+keller+projector&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Sir Jonas Moore: Practical Mathematics and Restoration Science|last=Willmoth|first=Frances|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=9780851153216|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=Koji|date=2015-12-01|title=Medicine, metals and empire: the survival of a chymical projector in early eighteenth-century London|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895512|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|volume=48|issue=4|pages=607–637|doi=10.1017/S000708741500059X|issn=0007-0874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern emphasis is less on a broad empiricism (one that includes passive observation of nature's activity), but on a narrow conception of the empirical concentrating on the ''control'' exercised through experimental (active) observation for the sake of ''control'' of nature. Nature is reduced to a passive recipient of human activity.

== Current work in the philosophy of science and nature==
In the middle of the 20th century, [[Ernst Mayr]]'s discussions on the [[teleology]] of nature brought up issues that were dealt with previously by Aristotle (regarding [[Four causes#Final cause|final cause]]) and Kant (regarding [[Critique of Judgment#Aesthetics|reflective judgment]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pt.scribd.com/doc/117102437/Teleology-and-Randomness-in-the-Development-of-Natural-Science-Research-Systems-Ontology-and-Evolution. "Teleology and Randomness in the Development of Natural Science Research: Systems, Ontology and Evolution" Interthesis, v. 8, n. 2, p. 316-334, jul/dec.2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially since the mid-20th-century European crisis, some thinkers argued the importance of looking at nature from a broad philosophical perspective, rather than what they considered a narrowly positivist approach relying implicitly on a hidden, unexamined philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Burtt, ''Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, 1954), 227-230.&lt;/ref&gt;  One line of thought grows from the Aristotelian tradition, especially as developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Another line springs from [[Edmund Husserl]], especially as expressed in ''The Crisis of European Sciences''. Students of his such as [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] and [[Hans Jonas]] more fully developed his themes. Last, but not least, there is the [[process philosophy]] inspired by [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s works.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond, (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among living scholars, [[Brian David Ellis]], [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]], [[David S. Oderberg|David Oderberg]], and [[John Dupré]] are some of the more prominent thinkers who can arguably be classed as generally adopting a more open approach to the natural world. Ellis (2002) observes the rise of a "New Essentialism."&lt;ref&gt;See his ''The Philosophy of Nature: A Guide to the New Essentialism'' 2002. {{ISBN|0-7735-2474-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Oderberg (2007) takes issue with other philosophers, including Ellis to a degree, who claim to be [[essentialism|essentialist]]s. He revives and defends the Thomistic-Aristotelian tradition from modern attempts to flatten nature to the limp subject of the experimental method.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Oderberg, ''Real Essentialism'' (Routledge, 2007). {{ISBN|0415323649}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [http://www.mqup.ca/in-praise-of-natural-philosophy-products-9780773549036.php In Praise of Natural Philosophy: A Revolution for Thought and Life] (2017), [[Nicholas Maxwell]] argues that we need to reform philosophy and put science and philosophy back together again to create a modern version of natural philosophy.

(p. 126)|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''obscurantism'' derives from the title of the 16th-century satire ''[[Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum]]'' (1515–19, ''Letters of Obscure Men''), that was based upon the [[intellectualism|intellectual]] dispute between the German humanist [[Johann Reuchlin]] and the monk [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]] of the [[Dominican Order]], about whether or not all [[Judaism|Jewish]] books should be [[Book burning|burned]] as un-Christian heresy. Earlier, in 1509, the monk Pfefferkorn had obtained permission from [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1486–1519), to burn all copies of the [[Talmud]] ([[Jewish law]] and [[Jewish ethics]]) known to be in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (AD 926–1806); the ''Letters of Obscure Men'' satirized the Dominican arguments for burning "un-Christian" works.

In the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers applied the term ''obscurantist'' to any enemy of intellectual enlightenment and the liberal diffusion of knowledge. In the 19th century, in distinguishing the varieties of obscurantism found in [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] from the "more subtle" obscurantism of the [[critical philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], and of modern [[philosophical skepticism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] said: "The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding, but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, F. (1878) ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' Vol. II, Part 1, 27. Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (November 13, 1996). {{ISBN|978-0-521-56704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In restricting knowledge to an [[Elite|élite]] ruling class of "the few", obscurantism is fundamentally [[anti-democratic]], because its component [[anti-intellectualism]] and [[elitism]] exclude the people as [[intellect]]ually unworthy of knowing the facts and truth about the [[government]] of their [[City-State]].&lt;ref name=Hersh&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M.

Moreover, in the realm of organized religion, obscurantism is a distinct strain of thought independent of theologic allegiance. The distinction is that fundamentalism presupposes sincere religious belief, whereas obscurantism is based upon minority manipulation of the popular faith as political praxis; cf.

=== Leo Strauss ===

==== Political philosophy ====
In the 20th century, the American conservative [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Leo Strauss]], for whom philosophy and politics intertwined, and his [[Neoconservatism|Neo-conservative]] adherents adopted the notion of government by the enlightened few as political strategy. He noted that [[intellectuals]], dating from [[Plato]], confronted the dilemma of either an informed populace "interfering" with government, or if it were possible for [[Value (ethics)|good]] politicians to be truthful and still govern to maintain a stable society—hence the [[Noble Lie]] necessary in securing public acquiescence. In ''The City and Man'' (1964), he discusses the myths in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that Plato proposes effective governing requires, among them, the belief that the country (land) ruled by the State belongs to it (despite some having been conquered from others), and that citizenship derives from more than the [[accident of birth]] in the City-State. Thus, in the ''New Yorker'' magazine article ''Selective Intelligence'', [[Seymour Hersh]] observes that Strauss endorsed the "[[Noble Lie]]" concept: the myths politicians use in maintaining a cohesive society.&lt;ref name="Hersh"&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/12/selective-intelligence "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 12 May 2003, accessed April 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml|date=2008-07-25}}, ''[[Reason Online]]'' July 1997, accessed 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shadia Drury]] criticized Strauss's acceptance of dissembling and deception of the populace as "the peculiar justice of the wise", whereas Plato proposed the Noble Lie as based upon [[Morality|moral]] good. In criticizing ''Natural Right and History'' (1953), she said that "Strauss thinks that the superiority of the ruling philosophers is an intellectual superiority and not a moral one ... [he] is the only interpreter who gives a sinister reading to Plato, and then celebrates him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-iraqwarphiloshophy/article_1542.jsp|title=Noble lies and perpetual war: Leo Strauss, the neocons, and Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Esoteric texts ====
Leo Strauss also was criticized for proposing the notion of "esoteric" meanings to ancient texts, obscure knowledge inaccessible to the "ordinary" intellect. In ''Persecution and the Art of Writing'' (1952), he proposes that some philosophers write esoterically to avert persecution by the political or religious authorities, and, per his knowledge of [[Maimonides]], [[Al Farabi]], and [[Plato]], proposed that an esoteric writing style is proper for the philosophic text. Rather than explicitly presenting his thoughts, the philosopher's esoteric writing compels the reader to think independently of the text, and so learn. In the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phædrus]]'', Socrates notes that writing does not reply to questions, but invites dialogue with the reader, thereby minimizing the problems of grasping the written word. Strauss noted that one of writing's political dangers is students' too-readily accepting dangerous ideas—as in the trial of [[Socrates]], wherein the relationship with [[Alcibiades]] was used to prosecute him.

For Leo Strauss, philosophers' texts offered the reader lucid "exoteric" (salutary) and obscure "esoteric" (true) teachings, which are concealed to the reader of ordinary intellect; emphasizing that writers often left contradictions and other errors to encourage the reader's more scrupulous (re-)reading of the text. In observing and maintaining the "[[exoteric]]&amp;nbsp;– [[esoteric]]" dichotomy, Strauss was accused of obscurantism, and for writing esoterically. 

=== Bill Joy ===
[[File:Bill joy.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Bill Joy]]]]
In the ''Wired'' magazine article, "[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]" (April 2000), the computer scientist [[Bill Joy]], then a [[Sun Microsystems]] chief scientist, in the sub-title proposed that: "Our most powerful twenty-first-century technologies—robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech[nology]—are threatening to make humans an endangered species"; in the body, he posits that:

:"The experiences of the atomic scientists clearly show the need to take personal responsibility, the danger that things will move too fast, and the way in which a process can take on a life of its own. We can, as they did, create insurmountable problems in almost no time flat. We must do more thinking up front if we are not to be similarly surprised and shocked by the consequences of our inventions."&lt;ref&gt;Khushf, George (2004). "The Ethics of Nanotechnology: Vision and Values for a New Generation of Science and Engineering", ''Emerging Technologies and Ethical Issues in Engineering'', National Academy of Engineering, pp. 31–32. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. {{ISBN|0-309-09271-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joy's proposal for limiting the dissemination of "certain" knowledge, in behalf of preserving society, was quickly likened to obscurantism. A year later, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], in the ''Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001'', published the article "A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists", wherein the computer scientists [[John Seely Brown]] and Paul Duguid countered his proposal as technological tunnel vision, and the predicted technologically derived problems as infeasible, for disregarding the influence of non-scientists upon such societal problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231160458/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-31 |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and- Gloom Technofuturists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal to emotion ==
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|&lt;center&gt;The economist [[Friedrich August von Hayek]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the essay "Why I Am Not a Conservative" (1960), the economist [[Friedrich von Hayek]] said that political [[conservatism]] is ideologically unrealistic, because of the conservative person’s inability to adapt to changing human realities and refusal to offer a positive political program that benefits everyone in a society. In that context, Hayek used the term ''obscurantism'' differently, to denote and describe the [[denial]] of the empirical truth of scientific theory, because of the disagreeable [[Morality|moral]] consequences that might arise from acceptance of fact.

== Deliberate obscurity ==
The second sense of ''obscurantism'' denotes making knowledge abstruse, that is, difficult to grasp. In the 19th and 20th centuries obscurantism became a [[polemics|polemical]] term for accusing an author of deliberately writing obscurely, in order to hide his or her [[intellectualism|intellectual]] vacuousness. Philosophers who are neither [[empiricism|empiricists]] nor [[positivism|positivists]] often are considered obscurantists when describing the abstract concepts of their disciplines. For philosophic reasons, such authors might modify or reject verifiability, falsifiability, and logical non-contradiction. From that perspective, obscure (clouded, vague, abstruse) writing does not necessarily indicate that the writer has a poor grasp of the subject, because unintelligible writing sometimes is purposeful and philosophically considered.&lt;ref name=Rorty&gt;Rorty, Richard (1989) ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Ch. 6: "From Ironist Theory to Private Allusions: Derrida". {{ISBN|0-521-36781-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[Aristotle]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Aristotle ===
In contemporary discussions of [[virtue ethics]], [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (''The Ethics'') stands accused of ethical obscurantism, because of the technical, philosophic language and writing style, and their purpose being the [[education]] of a cultured governing [[elite]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;Lisa van Alstyne, "Aristotle's Alleged Ethical Obscurantism." ''Philosophy,'' Vol. 73, No. 285 (July, 1998), pp. 429–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] employed technical terms that were not commonly understood by the layman. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] contended that post-Kantian philosophers such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] deliberately imitated the abstruse style of writing practiced by Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. 4, "Cogitata I," §&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[G. W. F. Hegel]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]'s philosophy, and the philosophies of those he influenced, especially [[Karl Marx]], have been accused of obscurantism. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] and [[Logical positivism|positivistic]] philosophers, such as [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and the [[Critical Rationalism|critical-rationalist]] [[Karl Popper]], accused Hegel and [[Hegelianism]] of being obscure. About Hegel's philosophy, Schopenhauer wrote that it is: "...&amp;nbsp;a colossal piece of mystification, which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur (1965). ''On the Basis of Morality'', trans. E.F.J. Payne. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, pp.15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, biographer Terry Pinkard notes "Hegel has refused to go away, even in analytic philosophy, itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel: A Biography'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel was aware of his obscurantism, and perceived it as part of philosophical thinking: to accept and transcend the limitations of quotidian (everyday) thought and its concepts. In the essay "Who Thinks Abstractly?", he said that it is not the philosopher who thinks abstractly, but the layman, who uses concepts as [[:wikt:given|givens]] that are immutable, without context. It is the philosopher who thinks concretely, because he transcends the limits of quotidian [[concept]]s, in order to understand their broader context. This makes philosophical thought and language appear obscure, esoteric, and mysterious to the layman.

=== Marx ===
[[File:Marx4.jpg|thumb|120px|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Karl Marx]] in 1861&lt;/center&gt;]]

In his early works,&lt;ref&gt;See his ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1844), ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1845), and ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx criticized German and French philosophy, especially [[German Idealism]], for its traditions of German irrationalism and ideologically motivated obscurantism.&lt;ref&gt;See, Dallmayr, Fred R., "The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger (and Habermas)", ''PRAXIS International'' (4/1988), pp. 377–404.&lt;/ref&gt; Later thinkers whom he influenced, such as the philosopher [[György Lukács]] and social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], followed with similar arguments of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]]'s ''The Destruction of Reason''; [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosophers such as Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek in turn criticized Marx and [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosophy as obscurantist (however, see [[#Appeal to emotion|above]] for Hayek's particular interpretation of the term).&lt;ref&gt;Wright, E. O., Levine, A., &amp; Sober, E. (1992). ''Reconstructing Marxism: essays on explanation and the theory of history''. London: Verso, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heidegger ===
[[Martin Heidegger]], and those influenced by him, such as [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], have been labeled obscurantists by critics from analytic philosophy and the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|Frankfurt School of critical theory]]. Of Heidegger, [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote, "his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Russell|first = Bertrand|authorlink = Bertrand Russell|title = Wisdom of the West|publisher = Crescent Books|year = 1989|pages = 303|isbn = 978-0-517-69041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is Russell's complete entry on Heidegger, and it expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0801485649|title=Heidegger: An Introduction|first=Richard|last=Polt|date=7 January 1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Derrida ===
In their obituaries, "Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74" (10 October 2004) and "Obituary of Jacques Derrida, French intellectual" (21 October 2004), ''[[The New York Times]]'' newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/10derrida.html|title=Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies in Paris at 74|date=10 October 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3308320|title=Jacques Derrida|date=21 October 2004|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Derrida as a deliberately obscure philosopher.

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' (1989), [[Richard Rorty]] proposed that in ''The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond'' (1978), Jacques Derrida purposefully used undefinable words (e.g. [[Différance]]), and used defined words in contexts so diverse that they render the words unintelligible, hence, the reader is unable to establish a context for his literary self. In that way, the philosopher Derrida escapes metaphysical accounts of his work. Since the work ostensibly contains no metaphysics, Derrida has, consequently, escaped metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Rorty /&gt;

Derrida's philosophic work is especially controversial among American and British academics, as when the [[University of Cambridge]] awarded him an honorary doctorate, despite opposition from among the Cambridge philosophy faculty and analytical philosophers worldwide. In opposing the decision, philosophers including [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[René Thom]], and twelve others, published a letter of protestation in ''[[The Times]]'' of London, arguing that "his works employ a written style that defies comprehension ... [thus] Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Smith et al., "Open letter against Derrida receiving an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University," ''The Times'' [London], 9 May 1992. [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/varia/Derrida_Letter.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''New York Review of Books'' article "An Exchange on Deconstruction" (February 1984), [[John Searle]] comments on [[Deconstruction]]: "... anyone who reads deconstructive texts with an open mind is likely to be struck by the same phenomena that initially surprised me: the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity, by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mackey| first = Louis H.| title = An Exchange on Deconstruction (Reply by John R. Searle)| journal = New York Review of Books| volume = 31| issue = 1| date = February 2, 1984| url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5964| accessdate = 2007-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lacan ===
[[Jacques Lacan]] was an [[intellectual]] who defended obscurantism to a degree. To his students' complaint about the deliberate obscurity of his lectures, he replied: "The less you understand, the better you listen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7Xw4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=%22The+less+you+understand,+the+better+you+listen%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20less%20you%20understand%2C%20the%20better%20you%20listen%22&amp;f=false | title = The ego in Freud's theory and in the technique of psychoanalysis, 1954–1955 | isbn = 978-0-521-31801-3 | author1 = Lacan | first1 = Jacques | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1973 seminar ''Encore'', he said that his ''Écrits'' (''Writings'') were not to be understood, but would effect a meaning in the reader, like that induced by mystical texts. The obscurity is not in his writing style, but in the repeated allusions to Hegel, derived from [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s lectures on Hegel, and similar theoretic divergences.

=== Sokal Affair ===

The [[Sokal Affair]] (1996) was a publishing [[hoax]] that the professor of physics [[Alan Sokal]] perpetrated on the editors and readers of ''[[Social Text]]'', an [[academic journal]] of [[postmodernism|post-modern]] [[cultural studies]] that was not then a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] publication. In 1996, as an experiment testing [[publishing|editorial]] integrity (fact-checking, verification, peer review, etc.), Sokal submitted "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity", a [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] article proposing that physical reality is a social construct, in order to learn if ''Social Text'' would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if: (a) it sounded good, and, (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref name = Physicist&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html| title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies| accessdate= April 3, 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| work = [[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]| date =May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal's fake article was published in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue of ''Social Text'', which was dedicated to the [[Science Wars]] about the conceptual validity of [[scientific objectivity]] and the nature of scientific theory, among [[Scientific realism|scientific realists]] and postmodern critics in American universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html| title = Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity| accessdate= 3 April 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| date = Spring–Summer 1996 |origyear=1994 (original version published 1994-11-28, revised 1995-05-13)| work = [[Social Text]]|issue= 46/47| publisher = [[Duke University]] Press| pages = 217–252|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070326153354/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokal's ''raison de guerre'' ("war reason") for publication of a false article was that postmodernist critics questioned the objectivity of science, by criticising the [[scientific method]] and the nature of knowledge, usually in the disciplines of cultural studies, [[cultural anthropology]], [[feminist studies]], [[comparative literature]], [[media studies]], and [[science and technology studies]]. Whereas the scientific realists countered that objective scientific knowledge exists, riposting that postmodernist critics almost knew nothing of the science they criticized. In the event, editorial deference to "[[Appeal to Authority|Academic Authority]]" (the Author-Professor) prompted the editors of ''Social Text'' not to fact-check Sokal's manuscript by submitting it to peer review by a scientist.

Later, concerning the lack of editorial integrity shown by the publication of his fake article in ''Social Text'' magazine, Sokal addressed the matter in the May 1996 edition of the ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' journal, in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", in which he (Sokal) announced that his transformative hermeneutics article was a [[parody]], submitted "to test the prevailing intellectual standards", and concluded that, as an academic publication, ''Social Text'' ignored the requisite [[intellectual rigor]] of verification and "felt comfortable publishing an article on [[quantum physics]] without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject".&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;ref name="LinguaFranca"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sokal| first = Alan | title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies | pages = 2| newspaper = Lingua Franca| date = May–June 1996| url = http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/01-07-17sokal-lingua-franca-experiment.pdf| accessdate =27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, as a [[Intellectual|public intellectual]], Sokal said his hoax was an action protesting against the contemporary tendency towards obscurantism—abstruse, esoteric, and vague writing in the [[social sciences]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, my concern over the spread of [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] thinking is both intellectual and political. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines is that they are false (when not simply meaningless). There is a real world; its properties are not merely social constructions; facts and evidence do matter. What sane person would contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary academic theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths—the utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and pretentious language.&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, independent of the hoax, as a pseudoscientific [[Masterpiece|opus]], the article "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" is described as an exemplar "[[pastiche]] of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Cant (language)|cant]], fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense, centered on the claim that physical reality is merely a social construct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harrell| first = Evans| title = A Report from the Front of the "Science Wars": The controversy over the book ''Higher Superstition,'' by Gross and Levitt and the recent articles by Sokal| journal = Notices of the American Mathematical Society| volume = 43| issue = 10| pages = 1132–1136| date =October 1996| url = http://www.ams.org/notices/199610/comm-harrell.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ordinary language philosophy''' is a [[philosophical methodology]] that sees traditional philosophical problems as rooted in misunderstandings philosophers develop by [[stipulative definition|distorting or forgetting what words actually mean]] in [[natural language|everyday use]]. "Such 'philosophical' uses of language, on this view, create the very philosophical problems they are employed to solve."&lt;ref name=ParkerRyan/&gt; Ordinary language philosophy is a branch of [[linguistic philosophy]] closely related to [[logical positivism]].&lt;ref name=ParkerRyan/&gt;

This approach typically involves eschewing philosophical "theories" in favor of close attention to the details of the use of everyday "ordinary" language. It is sometimes associated with the later work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and a number of mid-20th century philosophers that can be split into two main groups, neither of which could be described as an organized "school".&lt;ref name=Chappell/&gt; In its earlier stages contemporaries of Wittgenstein at Cambridge University such as [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Alice Ambrose]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]] and [[Morris Lazerowitz]] started to develop ideas recognisable as ordinary language philosophy. These ideas were further elaborated from 1945 onwards through the work of some Oxford University philosophers led initially by [[Gilbert Ryle]], then followed by [[J. L. Austin]]. This Oxford group also included [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[Geoffrey Warnock]], [[J. O. Urmson]] and [[P. F. Strawson|Peter Strawson]]. The close association between ordinary language philosophy and these later thinkers has led to it sometimes being referred to as "Oxford philosophy". More recent philosophers with at least some commitment to the method of ordinary language philosophy include [[Stanley Cavell]], [[John Searle]] and [[Oswald Hanfling]].

== Central ideas ==
The later Wittgenstein held that the meanings of words reside in their ordinary uses and that this is why philosophers trip over words taken in [[abstraction]]. From this came the idea that philosophy had gotten into trouble by trying to use words outside of the context of their use in ordinary language. For example, "understanding" is what you mean when you say "I understand". "Knowledge" is what you mean when you say "I know that". The point is, you ''already know'' what "understanding" or "knowledge" are, at least implicitly. Philosophers are ill-advised to construct new definitions for these terms, because this is necessarily a ''re''definition, and the argument may unravel into self-referential nonsense. Rather, philosophers must explore the definitions that these terms already have, without forcing a convenient redefinition onto them. 

The controversy really begins when ordinary language philosophers apply the same leveling tendency to questions such as ''What is Truth?'' or ''What is Consciousness?'' Philosophers in this school would insist that we cannot assume that (for example) 'Truth' 'is' a 'thing' (in the same sense that tables and chairs are 'things'), which the word 'truth' represents. Instead, we must look at the differing ways in which the words 'truth' and 'conscious' actually function in ordinary language. We may well discover, after investigation, that there is no single entity to which the word 'truth' corresponds, something Wittgenstein attempts to get across via his concept of a 'family resemblance' (cf. ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''). Therefore, ordinary language philosophers tend to be anti-[[essentialism|essentialist]].

Anti-essentialism and the linguistic philosophy associated with it are often important to contemporary accounts of [[feminism]], [[Marxism]], and other social philosophies that are critical of the injustice of the [[status quo]]. The essentialist 'Truth' as 'thing' is argued to be closely related to projects of domination, where the denial of alternate truths is understood to be a denial of alternate forms of living. Similar arguments sometimes involve ordinary language philosophy with other anti-essentialist movements like [[post-structuralism]]. However, strictly speaking, this is not a position derived from Wittgenstein, as it still involves 'misuse' (ungrammatical use) of the term "truth" in reference to "alternate truths".

== History ==
{{Wittgenstein|Movements}}
Early analytic philosophy had a less positive view of ordinary language. [[Bertrand Russell]] tended to dismiss language as being of little philosophical significance, and ordinary language as just being too confused to help solve metaphysical and epistemological problems.  [[Frege]], the [[Vienna Circle]] (especially [[Rudolf Carnap]]), the young Wittgenstein, and [[W.V. Quine]], all attempted to improve upon it, in particular using the resources of modern [[logic]]. Wittgenstein's view in the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' more or less agreed with Russell's that language ought to be reformulated so as to be unambiguous, so as to accurately represent the world, so that we could better deal with the questions of philosophy.

By contrast, Wittgenstein would later describe his task as bringing "words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use".&lt;ref name=Wittgenstein/&gt; The sea-change brought on by his unpublished work in the 1930s centered largely on the idea that there is nothing ''wrong'' with ordinary language as it stands, and that many traditional philosophical problems were only illusions brought on by misunderstandings about language and related subjects. The former idea led to rejecting the approaches of earlier analytic philosophy – arguably, of any earlier philosophy – and the latter led to replacing them with the careful attention to language in its normal use, in order to "dissolve" the appearance of philosophical problems, rather than attempt to solve them. At its inception, ordinary language philosophy (also called linguistic philosophy) had been taken as either an extension of or as an alternative to analytic philosophy. Now that the term "[[analytic philosophy]]" has a more standardized meaning, ordinary language philosophy is viewed as a stage of the analytic tradition that followed logical positivism and that preceded the yet-to-be-named stage analytic philosophy continues in today. According to Preston, analytic philosophy is now in a fifth, eclectic or pluralistic, phase he calls 'post-linguistic analytic philosophy' that tends to 'emphasize precision and thoroughness about a narrow topic, and to deemphasize the imprecise or cavalier discussion of broad topics'.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

Ordinary language analysis largely flourished and developed at [[Oxford]] in the 1940s, under Austin and [[Gilbert Ryle]], and was quite widespread for a time before declining rapidly in popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is now not uncommon to hear that Ordinary Language philosophy is no longer an active force.&lt;ref name=Forguson/&gt; Wittgenstein is perhaps the only one among the major figures of linguistic philosophy to retain anything like the reputation he had at that time. On the other hand, the attention to language remains one of the most important techniques in contemporary analytic thought, and many of the effects of ordinary language philosophy can still be felt across many academic disciplines.

== Criticism ==

One of the most ardent critics of ordinary language philosophy was a student at Oxford, [[Ernest Gellner]] who said:&lt;ref name=Gellner/&gt;

{{quote|"[A]t that time the orthodoxy best described as linguistic philosophy, inspired by Wittgenstein, was crystallizing and seemed to me totally and utterly misguided. Wittgenstein's basic idea was that there is no general solution to issues other than the custom of the community. Communities are ultimate. He didn't put it this way, but that was what it amounted to. And this doesn't make sense in a world in which communities are not stable and are not clearly isolated from each other. Nevertheless, Wittgenstein managed to sell this idea, and it was enthusiastically adopted as an unquestionable revelation. It is very hard nowadays for people to understand what the atmosphere was like then. This was ''the'' Revelation. It wasn't doubted. But it was quite obvious to me it was wrong. It was obvious to me the moment I came across it, although initially, if your entire environment, and all the bright people in it, hold something to be true, you assume ''you'' must be wrong, not understanding it properly, and they must be right. And so I explored it further and finally came to the conclusion that I did understand it right, and it ''was'' rubbish, which indeed it is."|Ernest Gellner|Interview with John Davis, 1991}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4395">{{distinguish|Moore's paradox}}
The '''paradox of analysis''' is a paradox that concerns how an [[analysis]] can be both correct and informative.  Although the problem takes its origin from the conflict in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno]]'', it was formulated in its complete form by philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] in his book ''[[Principia Ethica]]'', and first named by [[Cooper Harold Langford|C. H. Langford]] in his 1942 article "The Notion of Analysis in Moore's Philosophy".

==The paradox==
A [[conceptual analysis]] is something like the definition of a word.  However, unlike a standard dictionary definition (which may list examples or talk about related terms as well), a completely correct analysis of a concept in terms of others seems like it should have exactly the same meaning as the original concept.  Thus, in order to be correct, the analysis should be able to be used in any context where the original concept is used, without changing the meaning of the discussion in context.  Conceptual analyses of this sort are a major goal of [[analytic philosophy]].

However, if such an analysis is to be useful, it should be informative.  That is, it should tell us something we don't already know (or at least, something one can imagine someone might not already know).  But it seems that no conceptual analysis can both meet the requirement of correctness and of informativeness, on these understandings of the requirements.

To see why, consider a potential simple analysis:

:(1) For all x (any given member of a class or set), x is a brother if and only if x is a male sibling	

One can say that (1) is correct because the expression "brother" represents the same concept as the expression "male sibling," and (1) seems to be informative because the two expressions are not identical.  And if (1) is truly correct, then "brother" and "male sibling" must be interchangeable:

:(2) For all x, x is a brother if and only if x is a brother

Yet (2) is not informative, so either (1) is not informative, or the two expressions used in (1) are not interchangeable (because they change an informative analysis into an uninformative one) so (1) is not actually correct.  In other words, if the analysis is correct and informative, then (1) and (2) must be essentially equal, but this is not true because (2) is not informative.  Therefore, it seems an analysis cannot be both correct and informative at the same time.

==Proposed resolutions==
One way to resolve this paradox is to redefine what is an analysis.  In explaining the paradox, a potential analysis is assumed to be a relation between concepts rather than the verbal expressions used to illustrate them.  If the verbal expression is part of the analysis, then we shouldn't expect complete [[salva veritate|intersubstitutivity]] even in cases of correct analyses.  However, this response seems to move the notion of analysis into mere linguistic definition, rather than doing interesting work with concepts.

Another response is to [[bite the bullet]] and just say that correct analyses are uninformative — which then raises the question of what positive cognitive notion should be used instead of this one, if any.

One further response would be to take [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s position and reject the notion of conceptual analysis altogether. This is a natural response to the rejection of the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]]. The fact that many philosophers have followed Quine in this direction is part of the reason that many now say that the term "analytic philosophy" is a misnomer.

'''Philosophy and literature''' involves the [[literature|literary]] treatment of [[philosopher]]s and [[philosophy|philosophical]] themes (the literature of philosophy), and the philosophical treatment of issues raised by literature (the philosophy of literature).

==The philosophy of literature==
Strictly speaking, the philosophy of literature is a branch of [[aesthetics]], the branch of philosophy that deals with the question, "what is [[art]]"?  Much of aesthetic philosophy has traditionally focused on the plastic arts or [[music]], however, at the expense of the verbal arts.  In fact, much traditional discussion of aesthetic philosophy seeks to establish criteria of artistic quality that are indifferent to the subject matter being depicted.  Since all literary works, almost by definition, contain notional content, aesthetic theories that rely on purely formal qualities tend to overlook literature.

The very existence of [[narrative]] raises philosophical issues.  In narrative, a creator can embody, and readers be led to imagine, [[fiction]]al characters, and even [[fantasy|fantastic]] creatures or technologies.  The ability of the human mind to imagine, and even to experience [[empathy]] with, these fictional characters is itself revealing about the nature of the human mind.  Some fiction can be thought of as a sort of a [[thought experiment]] in [[ethics]]: it describes fictional characters, their [[Motivation|motive]]s, their actions, and the consequences of their actions.  It is in this light that some philosophers have chosen various narrative forms to teach their philosophy (''see below'').

===Literature and language===
[[Plato]], for instance, believed that literary culture and even the [[lyrics]] of [[popular music]] had a strong impact on the ethical outlook of its consumers.  In ''[[Republic (dialogue)|The Republic]]'', Plato displays a strong hostility to the contents of the literary culture of his period, and proposes a strong [[censorship]] of popular literature in his [[utopia]].

More recently, however, philosophers of various stripes have taken different and less hostile approaches to literature.  Since the work of the [[British Empiricists]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] in the late eighteenth century, Western philosophy has been preoccupied with a fundamental question of [[epistemology]]: the question of the relationship between [[idea]]s in the human mind and the world existing outside the mind, if in fact such a world exists.  In more recent years, these epistemological issues have turned instead to an extended discussion of [[word]]s and meaning: can [[language]] in fact bridge the barrier between minds?  This cluster of issues concerning the meaning of language and of "[[writing]]s" sometimes goes by the name of ''the [[linguistic turn]]''.

As such, techniques and tools developed for [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] rose to greater prominence in Western philosophy of the late twentieth century.  Philosophers of various stripes paid more attention to literature than their predecessors did.  Some sought to examine the question of whether it was in fact truly possible to communicate using words, whether it was possible for an author's intended meaning to be communicated to a reader.  Others sought to use literary works as examples of contemporary [[culture]], and sought to reveal unconscious attitudes they felt present in these works for the purpose of social criticism.

===The truth of fiction===
Literary works also pose issues concerning [[truth]] and the [[philosophy of language]].  In educated opinion, at least, it is commonly reputed as true that ''[[Sherlock Holmes]] lived in London''. (see David Lewis 'Truth in Fiction', American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 15. No. 1, January 1978)  It is also considered true that ''[[Samuel Pepys]] lived in London''.  Yet Sherlock Holmes never lived anywhere at all; he is a fictional character.  Samuel Pepys, contrarily, is judged to have been a real person.  Contemporary interest in Holmes and in Pepys share strong similarities; the only reason why anyone knows either of their names is because of an abiding interest in reading about their alleged deeds and words.  These two statements would appear to belong to two different orders of truth.  Further problems arise concerning the [[truth value]] of statements about fictional worlds and characters that can be implied but are nowhere explicitly stated by the sources for our knowledge about them, such as ''Sherlock Holmes had only one head'' or ''Sherlock Holmes never travelled to the moon''.

==The literature of philosophy==

===Philosophical poems===
{{Literature}}
A number of [[poetry|poets]] have written poems on philosophical themes, and some important philosophers have expressed their philosophy in verse.  The [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] and the ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' of [[Lucretius]] are important philosophical poems. The genre of [[epic poetry]] was also used to teach philosophy. [[Vyasa]] narrated the ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in order to teach [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]]. [[Homer]] also presented some philosophical teachings in his ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Many of the [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophers]] worked out their thought in poetical fashion. Some of the important names include:

* [[Vyasa]]
* [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi]]
* [[Omar Khayyám]]
* [[Nizami Ganjavi]]
* [[Saadi (poet)|Sheikh Saadi]]
* [[Hafez|Hafiz Shirazi]]
* [[Muhammad Iqbal]]
* [[Matsuo Bashō]]
* [[Farid ud-Din Attar]]
* [[Salah Abd El-sabur]]
* [[Mahmoud Darwish]]
* [[Karim Elsaiad]]

Notable Western [[philosophical poets]] include:

* [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]
* [[St. John of the Cross]]
* [[T. S. Eliot]]
* [[Hildegard von Bingen]]
* [[Homer]]
* [[John Milton]]
* [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]
* [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]]
* [[Marianne Moore]]
* [[Pablo Neruda]]
* [[William Carlos Williams]]
* [[Mary Oliver]]
* [[ Rainer Maria Rilke]]
* [[Leslie Marmon Silko]]
* [[Robert Creeley]]
* [[Fernando Pessoa]]
* [[Søren Kierkegaard]]
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
* [[Georges Bataille]]
* [[Lucretius]]

===Philosophical fiction===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Borges.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote philosophical fiction.]] --&gt;
Some philosophers have undertaken to write philosophy in the form of [[fiction]], including novels and short stories (see separate article on [[philosophical fiction]]).  This is apparent early on in the literature of philosophy, where philosophers such as [[Plato]] wrote [[dialogue]]s in which fictional or fictionalized characters discuss philosophical subjects; [[Socrates]] frequently appears as a protagonist in Plato's dialogues, and the dialogues are one of the prime sources of knowledge about Socrates' teaching, though at this remove it is sometimes hard to distinguish Socrates' actual positions from Plato's own. Numerous early Christian writers, including [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Boethius]], and [[Peter Abelard]] produced dialogues; several early modern philosophers, such as [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], wrote occasionally in this genre.

Other philosophers have resorted to [[narrative]] to get their teachings across. The classical 12th century [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]] (Ibn Tufail), wrote a fictional [[Arabic literature|Arabic narrative]] ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to [[al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then the 13th century [[Kalam|Islamic theologian]]-philosopher [[Ibn al-Nafis]] also wrote a fictional narrative ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a response to Abubacer's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] often articulated his ideas in literary modes, most notably in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', a re-imagined account of the teachings of [[Zoroaster]]. [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Ayn Rand]] wrote novels in which characters served as mouthpieces for philosophical positions, and act in accordance with them in the plot. [[George Santayana]] was also a philosopher who wrote novels and poetry; the relationship between Santayana's characters and his beliefs is more complex.  The [[existentialism|existentialists]] include among their numbers important [[French language|French]] authors who used fiction to convey their philosophical views; these include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s novel ''[[Nausea (Book)|Nausea]]'' and play ''[[No Exit]]'', and [[Albert Camus]]'s  ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''. [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s entire fictional production, whose titles include ''[[The Step Not Beyond]]'', ''[[The madness of the Day]]'', and ''[[The Writing of Disaster]]'', among others, constitutes an indispensable corpus for the treatment of the relationship between philosophy and literature. So does [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ''[[The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond]]''.

A number of philosophers have had important influence on literature.  [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], largely as a result of his [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics|system of aesthetics]], is perhaps the most influential recent philosopher in the history of literature; [[Thomas Hardy]]'s later novels frequently allude to Schopenhauerian themes, particularly in ''[[Jude the Obscure]]''.  Schopenhauer also had an important influence on [[Joseph Conrad]].  Schopenhauer also had a less specific but more  widely diffused influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in European literature.  [[Lionel Johnson]] also refers to Schopenhauer's aesthetics in his essay ''The Cultured Faun''. [[Jacques Derrida]]'s entire oeuvre has been hugely influential for so-called continental philosophy and the understanding of the role of literature in modernity.

Other works of fiction considered to have philosophical content include:

*Abubacer, ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]''
*Albert Camus, ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Outsider]]''
*Joseph Conrad, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''
*Fyodor Dostoevsky, ''[[Crime and Punishment]]
*Jostein Gaarder, ''[[Sophie's World]]
* Hermann Hesse, ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]
*James Joyce, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''
*Franz Kafka, ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''
*Milan Kundera, ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''
*Ibn al-Nafis, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]''
*Thomas Mann, ''[[The Magic Mountain]]''
*Iris Murdoch, ''[[The Sea, the Sea]]''
*Robert M. Pirsig, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''
*Marcel Proust, ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]
*William Shakespeare, ''[[Hamlet]]''
*Leo Tolstoy, ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''
*Sergio Troncoso, ''[[The Nature of Truth]]''
*Marguerite Yourcenar, ''[[Memoirs of Hadrian]]''

===Philosophical writing as literature===
A number of philosophers are still read for the literary merits of their works apart from their philosophical content.  The philosophy in the ''[[Meditations]]'' of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] is unoriginal [[Stoicism]], but the ''Meditations'' are still read for their literary merit and for the insight they give into the workings of the emperor's mind.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy is noted for the quality and readability of its prose, as are some of the works of the [[British Empiricism|British Empiricists]], such as [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]].  [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s style is frequently regarded as poetic artistry as well as philosophical, especially in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Either/Or]]''.  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works such as ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' frequently resemble [[prose poetry]] and contain imagery and allusion instead of argument.

==Philosophy in literature==

===Philosophers in literature===
Socrates appears in a highly fictionalized guise, as a comic figure and the object of mockery, in ''[[The Clouds]]'' by [[Aristophanes]].  In the play, Socrates appears hanging from a basket, where he delivers oracles such as:

:I'd never come up with a single thing&lt;br&gt; about celestial phenomena,&lt;br&gt;if I did not suspend my mind up high,&lt;br&gt;to mix my subtle thoughts with what's like them—&lt;br&gt;the air. If I turned my mind to lofty things,&lt;br&gt;but stayed there on the ground, I'd never make&lt;br&gt;the least discovery. For the earth, you see,&lt;br&gt;draws moist thoughts down by force into itself—&lt;br&gt;the same process takes place with water cress.

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] is perhaps the twentieth century's preeminent author of philosophical fiction.  He wrote a short story in which the philosopher [[Averroes]] is the chief protagonist, ''[[Averroes's Search]]''.  Many plot points in his stories accurately paraphrase and epitomize the thought of major philosophers, including [[George Berkeley]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and [[Bertrand Russell]]; he also attributes various opinions to figures including [[George Dalgarno]].

A key plot point in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' turns on the discovery of a mysterious book that turns out to contain a lost manuscript by [[Aristotle]].  Eco's later novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum (book)|Foucault's Pendulum]]'' became the forerunner of a run of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s or [[detective fiction]] that toss around learned allusions and the names of historical thinkers; more recent examples include [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and ''[[The Rule of Four (book)|The Rule of Four]]'' by [[Ian Caldwell]] and [[Dustin Thomason]].

Also, [[Philip K. Dick]], who has often been compared to Borges, raises a significant number of philosophical issues in his novels, everything from the problem of [[solipsism]] to many questions of [[perception]] and [[reality]].

===Fictional philosophers===
Jorge Luis Borges introduces many philosophical themes, and a number of fictional philosophers, in his [[short story|short stories]].  A fictional philosophical movement is a part of the premise of his story ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', and the unnamed narrator of his story ''[[The Library of Babel]]'' could also be called a fictional philosopher.  A fictional [[theology|theologian]] is the subject of his story ''[[Three Versions of Judas]]''.

Fictional philosophers occasionally occur throughout the works of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].  Heinlein's ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' contains long passages that could be considered as successors to the fictionalized philosophical dialogues of the ancient world, set within the plot.

'''Philosophy of Architecture''' is a branch of [[philosophy of art]], dealing with aesthetic value of [[architecture]], its [[semantics]] and relations with development of [[culture]].

==History ==

=== Early history ===

[[Plato]], whose influence on architecture is widely documented (e.g., 'idealism', 'neo-Platonic' architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | authorlink=John Shannon Hendrix | date=1999 | title=Neoplatonic Philosophy and Roman Baroque Architecture | journal=The European Studies Journal | publisher=University of Northern Iowa | volume=16 | issue=1 |pages=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;), may be counted as part of a classical geometric model of cosmology, the popularity of which could be attributed to earlier thinkers such as [[Pythagoras]]. In early history, philosophers distinguished architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural. It was only with Socratic irony that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity. The presence of some degree of formalism ala Platonism continues to be an important trait in distinguishing one architectural style from another, and thus in distinguishing the philosophy of a style.

Due to the nature of critique, the philosophy of architecture is an outgrowth of the [[philosophy of art]], which began to be expressed in books on architecture and history of architecture during the latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Harries K. | title= Philosophy and the Task of Architecture | journal=Journal of Architectural Education | volume=40 | issue=2 | date=Winter 1987 | pages=29 | doi=10.2307/1424928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, largely because of its reliance on technology and engineering, architecture was seen as incompatible, or beneath, the proper subject areas of classical aesthetics as delimited by, notably, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], with their ideal of "pure art."&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29" /&gt;

=== Modern period ===

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb | Panopticon. Drawing by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in 1791.]]
As it was noted by [[Michel Foucault]], the architecture is able to set the life of society, and therefore it is particularly important for understanding of the person's values and culture. In "[[Discipline and Punish]]" Foucault analized contemporary culture through architecture project of principally new prison [[Panopticon]]. The point of this project by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was to create a special transparent environment for prisoners, where everyone would be under constant surveillance. Although the project was not realized, Bentham's thought deeply influenced ideology of prisons, changing social practices of punishment. Simultaneously with its main conclusions Foucault reached other goal - his instrumental use of architecture in cultural studies showed the potential of this philosophical theme.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

However, philosophy of architecture as a full-fledged part of the Philosophy of Art, would not have been possible without the [[Avant-garde]]`s shift of the aesthetic paradigm. Art, set in the conditions of [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|mechanical reproduction of the image]], was forced to look for new ways. Around the same time architectural styles of [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] find way to justify new, totally engineering aesthetics. Side of the architecture, which had been considered a shame (as a sign of its connection with the pragmatic needs of man and society), became a major advantage, central part of new system of aesthetic values. [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] set aesthetic, full of mechanized, slaughtered, brutal forms, what was very close to the same engineering ideal. All this created more than favorable environment to change status of architecture in our system of art, as well as our understanding of art by itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Postmodernism ===
[[File:Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village crop.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photography "[[Stuyvesant Town - Peter Cooper Village]]," according to Martin R.&lt;ref name="Martin R."&gt;Martin R. "Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern." ''Grey Room,'' No. 22 (Winter, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an architectural work, which may serve as one of the first manifestations of postmodernism]]
Architecture assumed much more significant role after establishing of the phenomenon of [[Postmodernism]]. According to R. Martin "it remains surprising how many influential accounts of cultural postmodernism make reference to architecture."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt;
Some scholars go so far as to claim that the entire post-modernism comes from the practice of architecture, and the rejection of "[[Art Nouveau|style of Modern]]" as an architectural style, and by so architects terminologically formulated postmodernism. Thus, F. Jameson writes that "it is in the realm of architecture, however, that modifications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated (...) it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of post-modernism (...) initially began to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was noted by researchers, "Barthes and Eco, taking their cue from Russian Formalism, see norm breaking as the mark of the aesthetic (sc., the aesthetic code). Art is characteristically inventive in its capacity to have signs do duty as signifier of further meanings in a potentially endless play upon convention as well as within it or on its margin."&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"&gt;Donougho M. The Language of Architecture // Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; So important to postmodern writers like [[Barthes, Roland|R. Bart]] and [[Eco, Umberto|U. Eco]], saw architecture as a source of revolutionary innovations in art.&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"/&gt;
[[File:The Luxor From Airport.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photo of casino "Luxor", an example of architecture of "Las Vegas", which formed the basis for post-modernist manifesto of [[Robert Venturi]] and has played a key role in the development of post-modernism according to F. Jameson]]F. Jameson believes that there is a special relationship between postmodernism and American architecture, in which the birth of a national architecture coincided, in his opinion, with the emergence of the terminology or even the reality of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all researchers agree with his post-modern "architectural origins," so [[Andreas Huyssen]], suggests that the conceptual frame of postmodernism has been defined within certain movements of literature. However, this researcher also notes the special role of architecture in the development of post-modernism. Martin describes, that "Huyssen credits architecture with helping to disseminate the term postmodernism, originally from literature, into the expanded aesthetic sphere during the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] contends that postmodern architects have nothing in common with true Postmodernism &lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; and, as Lyotard states it in his article, ''Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism?'': "under the name of postmodernism, architects are getting rid of the Bauhaus project, throwing out the baby of experimentation with the bathwater of functionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard J.-F. Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism? // Lyotard J.-F. The Posmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. 1984. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special figure for the philosophy of architecture can be considered the architect [[Robert Venturi]], whose books may have played a no lesser role in the development of [[postmodernism]], than his stylistic experiments in architecture. R. Venturi first lead attention of architects to [[pop-art]]. In his rejection of architectural modernism Venturi  gave rise to the new cultural setting. By this Venturi showed a deep connection between civilization and architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R. Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern // Grey Room, No. 22 (Winter, 2006), pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wittgenstein and philosophy of architecture ==
[[File:Wittgenstein haus.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Wittgenstein House]]
The [[Wittgenstein House]] is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture. Built by renowned [[Austria]]n philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the house has been the subject of extensive research about the relationship between its stylistic features, Wittgenstein's personality, and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb G.

The '''philosophy of copyright''' considers philosophical issues linked to [[copyright]] [[policy]], and other [[jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] problems that arise in legal systems' interpretation and application of copyright law.

One debate concerns the purpose of copyright.  Some take the approach of looking for coherent ''justifications'' of established copyright systems, while others start with general ethical theories, such as [[utilitarianism]] and try to analyse policy through that lens.  Another approach denies the meaningfulness of any ethical justification for existing copyright law, viewing it simply as a result (and perhaps an undesirable result) of political processes.

Another widely debated issue is the relationship between [[copyrights]] and other forms of "[[intellectual property]]", and material property.  Most scholars of copyright agree that it can be called a kind of [[property]], because it involves the [[exclusive right|exclusion]] of others from something.  But there is disagreement about the extent to which that fact should allow the transportation of other beliefs and intuitions about material possessions.

There are many other [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions which arise in the jurisprudence of copyright.  They include such problems as determining when one work is "derived" from another, or deciding when information has been placed in a "tangible" or "material" form.

==Justifications for copyright==

Legal scholars often approach copyright in search of a coherent ethical justification for its existence and character.  This approach may seem to be backwards—it might make more sense to start with an objective and then examine the law against it—but it is widely practised.  Thus, the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] or ethical theories that might naively be regarded as tests for copyright law to pass are often called "justifications" of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justifications for copyright can generally be approximated into two groups: deontological or consequentialist. Deontological justifications for copyright seek to justify copyright as a matter of rights or duty; they seek to assert a justification for copyright (or intellectual property more generally) on the basis that it is morally correct to do so. Contrariwise, consequentialist theories of copyright seek to justify or criticise copyright protection based on the consequences of that protection, by asserting or providing evidence that the protection of copyright produces some desirable effect. Examples of such theories include incentives theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutfield|first=Graham|last2=Suthersanen|first2=Uma|title=Global intellectual property law|year=2008|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham, UK|isbn=978-1-84720-364-9|pages=51–52, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural rights===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Natural rights]] are linked to the logic{{clarify|date=June 2013}} of [[property]]. [[John Locke]] is often cited as an authority, although it is not clear that Locke actually viewed copyright as a natural right.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} {{citation needed span|text=[[Personality rights]] are the basis of German copyright law.This position regards copyrightable works to be extensions of the author's personality. The author is given certain powers to control those works on account of his or her connection to them.|date=June 2013}}

===Morality===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
Proponents of copyright and patent laws believe that morality supports their stance.

=== Economics ===
{{Disputed section|date=June 2013}}
Many economists{{who|date=June 2013}} believe that, {{citation needed span|text=in the absence of intellectual property protections such as [[copyright]] and [[patents]], various types of intangible assets would be under-produced{{according to whom|date=June 2013}}, because there would be [[free-rider problem|insufficient incentives]] for commercial organisations to produce them.|date=June 2013}}  From this perspective, the objective of [[copyright law]] is primarily to balance the public benefits{{how|date=June 2013}} that can arise from the widespread circulation, use and reuse of a copyright work with the need to provide protection, incentive and reward to the creator or owner of the copyright by granting a limited{{clarify|date=June 2013}} [[monopoly]] to exploit the copyright to that body or individual.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Lilley (July 2006) Inside the Creative Industries - Copyright on the ground, [[ippr]],[http://www.ippr.org.uk/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=483] {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}

===Consequentialist theories===
Consequentialist theories of copyright hold that we should have the laws that will produce the 'best' results for society.  The most common consequentialist position is [[utilitarianism]], which defines the 'best' situations to be those in which people are in total as happy or fulfilled as possible.  Economists' analyses of copyright tend to follow this philosophical approach.

A related class of theories is called [[instrumentalism]]; it holds that copyright law must exist for clear, coherent and necessary purposes, without being so strict as to require that it maximise some kind of 'goodness' in its outcome.

Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; They argue that the public interest is best served by repeated extension of copyright terms to encompass multiple generations beyond the copyright holder's life, as this increases the present value of the copyright, encouraging the creation for new works and making additional investments in older works (for example, the restoration of old movies) economically viable.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite journal| author = Scott M. Martin | date = September 24, 2002 | title = The Mythology of the Public Domain: Exploring the Myths Behind Attacks on the Duration of Copyright Protection | journal = Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review | volume = 36| issue = 1| page = 280| publisher = Loyola Law Review| issn = 1533-5860 | url = http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2343&amp;context=llr| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors' heirs continue to profit if copyrights are enforced post-death and this provides a substantial incentive for continued  fresh work even as authors age.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

The modern, market-driven copyright system provides authors with independent financing (through royalties). Without a feasible way to recoup investments of creative time through copyright, there would be little economic incentive to produce and works would need to be motivated by a desire for fame from already affluent authors or those able to obtain patronage (with associated constraints on independence). Proponents of copyright dispute that copyright erodes precepts for creators to be able to build on published expression pointing to concepts such as [[Scènes à faire]] and [[Idea-expression divide]]. Copyright only protects the artist's expression of his/her work and not the ideas, systems, or factual information conveyed in it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus artists are free to get ideas from copyrighted works.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

Defenders of the present system of strong copyrights argue that it has been largely successful in financing the creation and distribution of a wide variety of works, especially those requiring significant labor and capital. Moderate scholars seem to support that view while recognizing the need for exceptions and limitations, such as the [[fair use]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|page=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, a substantial portion of the current U.S. Copyright Act (sections 107–120) is devoted to such exceptions and limitations.

====Consequentialism in the United States====

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] of the [[United States Constitution]] authorizes [[United States Congress|Congress]] to "''promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries''".

Many authors thought that this wording would actually require U.S. copyright laws to serve the purpose of "promoting the progress of science and useful arts". {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the US in 2003 controversial changes implemented by the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] extending the length of copyright under [[U.S. copyright law]] by 20 years were challenged in the [[United States Supreme Court]]. However, the Court, in the case called [[Eldred v. Ashcroft]], held, ''inter alia'', that in placing existing and future copyrights in parity in the CTEA, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations. Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation to provide for similar extensions of the copyright term.

== Opposition to copyright ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Copyright]] --&gt;
{{main article|Anti-copyright}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2008}}
[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Anti-copyright demonstration in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], 2006.]]
Critics of copyright as a whole fall broadly into two categories: Those who assert that the very concept of copyright has never benefited society, and has always served simply to enrich a few at the expense of creativity; and those who assert that the existing copyright regime must be reformed to maintain its relevance in the new [[Information society]]. The [[French copyright law|French ''droit d'auteur'']] ("Rights of the Author"), which influenced the 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], must also be noted as a significant alternative to the usual Anglo-Saxon concept of copyright.

Among the latter group, there are also some who continue to agree with copyright as a way to grant authors rights, but feel that it "outlives its welcome" by granting copyright for too long (e.g., far beyond the lifetime of the author), and is therefore of little direct benefit to him or her.  The prolongation of copyright term is commonly attributed to effective corporate [[lobbying]], based on a desire for the continuance of a profitable monopoly. In the US, this is often phrased as a conspiracy to 'control the Mouse' (meaning [[Mickey Mouse]], a [[trademark]]ed character controlled by the Disney Company whose early works would have moved into the public domain save for such an extension).

To many critics, the general problem is that the current (international) copyright system undermines its own goal.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The concepts of the [[public domain]] and the intrinsic freedom of information are necessary precepts for creators to be able to build on published expression.  But these are gradually being eroded, as copyright terms are repeatedly extended to last beyond the lifetime of the audience which experienced and knows of the original work.

Another effect of the repeated extension of copyright term is that current authors are shielded from competition from a wide public domain: by the time current works enter the public domain, they will almost always have become obsolete. This reduces the risk of commoditization of topical non-fiction. Out-of-copyright publishing, such as classic literature where margins are very low, generally offers only the best of each genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karjala|first=Dennis|title=About Copyright Term Extension|url=http://www.law.asu.edu/HomePages/Karjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/what.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030827220623/http://www.law.asu.edu/homepages/karjala/opposingcopyrightextension/what.html|archivedate=2003-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Luck|first=Randolph|title=Letter to Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, opposing copyright term extension in the 104th Congress, June 28th 1996|url=http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/letters/Luck%27sMusic01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to current copyright practice also relates to the non-observance of the principal requirement of the original Queen Anne Act, which specified that for a work to obtain copyright a copy had to be deposited in a library of record, so that unlimited copies could be made when the copyright expired. This was observed for many years but was later successfully opposed by the motion picture industry, which refused to provide copies of their films, resulting in the loss of many early films. Civilization experiences a similar loss of ancient documents from being held in private collections until they rot.

The recent success of [[free software]] projects such as [[Linux|GNU/Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and the [[Apache web server]] has demonstrated that quality works can be created even in the absence of a copyright-enforced monopoly rent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.cio.com/consultant/report2214.html&lt;/ref&gt;  These products use copyright to enforce their license terms, which are designed to ensure the free nature of the work, rather than securing exclusive rights for the holder for monetary gain. Such licenses include [[copyleft]], [[free software license|free software]], and [[open source license]]s.

Even in more traditional forms such as prose, some authors, such as [[Cory Doctorow]], retain the copyright to their work but license it for free distribution (for example under a [[Creative Commons license]]).  This has the benefit of providing a structured scheme under which authors can loosen some of the barriers that copyright imposes on others, allowing them to partially contribute the work to the community (in the form of giving a general grant on copying, reproduction, use or adaptation subject to certain conditions) while retaining other exclusive rights they hold in it.

Copyright can also be used to stifle political criticism. For example, in the US the contents of talk shows and similar programs are covered by copyright. [[Robert Greenwald]], a director of ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War'' documentary was refused the right to use a clip of a [[George W. Bush]] interview from [[NBC]]'s ''Meet the Press''. Although the fair use provisions of statute and common law may apply in such cases, the risks of loss in court should there be a lawsuit and pressure from insurance companies, who regard use of almost anything (e.g., three words forming the opening of a song,) without permission as too risky, usually precludes use of materials without explicit permission, and so without a license fee.

Copyright is also conceived by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Electronic Frontier Foundation|url=https://www.eff.org/work}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be an artificial barrier in that "expressions" could be freely exchanged between individuals and groups if there were no copyright or other legal restrictions preventing. Such people believe that as the [[State (polity)|state]] does not necessarily possess the [[moral authority]] to enact copyright laws, individuals may vary in their observation of such laws. Others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Copyright Alliance|url=http://www.copyrightalliance.org/issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Motion Picture Association of America|url=http://www.mpaa.org/contentprotection/copyright-info}}&lt;/ref&gt; disagree, believing that copyright (which in the United States system, for instance, arises from provisions in the U.S. Constitution), has made and continues to make a valuable even essential contribution to the creation and dissemination of works. They also point out the social dangers inherent in the view that each individual is entitled to judge the "moral authority" of laws and to observe them or not according to individual judgments.

==Modern challenges to copyright==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=March 2017}}
Copyright concepts are under challenge in the modern era, primarily from the increasing use of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]]. Major copyright holders, such as the major [[record labels]] and the [[major film studios|movie industry]], blame the ease of copying for their decreasing profits. Alternative explanations have been put forward, such as poor product content and excessive license charges.

In the United States [[public interest]] groups, major corporations and the like, are entering the public education system to teach the curriculum from their perspectives. The lobbying group for the [[MPAA]] provide a curriculum entitled ''What's the Diff?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediainfocenter.org/story.asp?story_id=61684893 What's the Diff?]&lt;/ref&gt; taught by a group of volunteers called Junior Achievement. The [[Business Software Alliance]] also has their own curriculum program called ''Play it Cybersafe'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playitcybersafe.com Play it Cybersafe]&lt;/ref&gt; which is distributed to school children through a magazine called ''[[The Weekly Reader]]''. The American Librarian Association released their own curriculum for librarians that was distributed in the winter of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org The American Librarian Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1794">The '''Philosophy of mathematics education''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] area of study and research based on the intersection of the fields of [[mathematics education]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the latter being understood in an inclusive sense to include multidisciplinary theorizing about mathematics incorporating philosophical, sociological, anthropological, semiotic, historical, ethnomathematical, etc., perspectives. 

Some of the central questions addressed by this sub-field are:
*What is mathematics?, and what accounts have philosophers and other theorists given of it?
*How does mathematics relate to society? 
*What are the aims of teaching and learning mathematics?
*What fundamental assumptions underlie the learning and teaching mathematics? 
*How do philosophies of mathematics link with mathematics teaching and learning? 
*What is the status of mathematics education as knowledge field?

'''Philosophy of science''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of [[science]]. The central questions of this study concern [[Demarcation problem|what qualifies as science]], the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], for example, when it explores the relationship between science and [[truth]].

There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the [[scientific realism|truth about unobservable things]] and [[problem of induction|whether scientific reasoning can be justified]] at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as [[philosophy of biology|biology]] or [[philosophy of physics|physics]]). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.

While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the [[logical positivism]] movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' was also formative, challenging the view of [[scientific progress]] as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a "[[paradigm]]," the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324460/Thomas-S-Kuhn Thomas S. Kuhn.] "Instead, he argued that the paradigm determines the kinds of experiments scientists perform, the types of questions they ask, and the problems they consider important."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology.

Subsequently, the [[Coherentism|coherentist]] approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and others. Some thinkers such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] seek to ground science in [[axiomatic]] assumptions, such as the [[uniformity of nature]]. A vocal minority of philosophers, and [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) in particular, argue that there is no such thing as the "[[scientific method]]", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly [[supernatural]] ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how [[Constructivist epistemology|knowledge is created]] from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, an approach represented by scholars like [[David Bloor]] and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]]. Finally, a tradition in [[continental philosophy]] approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.

Philosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|time]] raised by Einstein's [[general relativity]], to the implications of [[Philosophy and economics|economics]] for [[public policy]]. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be [[Reductionism|reduced]] to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual [[Philosophy of psychology|psychology]]? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the [[foundations of statistics]]. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the [[philosophy of medicine]]. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the [[Philosophy of social science|social sciences]] explore whether the scientific studies of [[human nature]] can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and by social relations.

==Introduction==

===Defining science===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Popper in the 1980s]]
Distinguishing between science and [[non-science]] is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should [[psychoanalysis]] be considered science? How about so-called [[creation science]], the [[Multiverse|inflationary multiverse]] hypothesis, or [[macroeconomics]]? [[Karl Popper]] called this the central question in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Thornton2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|title = Karl Popper|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Thornton|first = Stephen|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Laudan | first = Larry | editor = Adolf Grünbaum |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |editor3=Larry Laudan | title = Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum | year = 1983 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-90-277-1533-3 | chapter = The Demise of the Demarcation Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] has argued for the use of a [[Potter Stewart standard]] ("I know it when I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=pseudoscience+potter+stewart#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudoscience%20potter%20stewart&amp;f=false|pages = 12–13|title = The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe|first = Michael D.|last = Gordin|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780226304427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early attempts by the [[logical positivists]] grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless.&lt;ref name="Uebel2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/|title = Vienna Circle|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Uebel|first = Thomas|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper argued that the central property of science is [[falsifiability]]. That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{cite book | last = Popper | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Popper | title = The logic of scientific discovery | year = 2004|edition=reprint| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = London &amp; New York | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yq6xeupNStMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+logic+of+scientific+discovery | isbn=978-0-415-27844-7 | postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First published 1959 by Hutchinson &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

===Scientific explanation===
{{Main|Scientific explanation}}

A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide [[explanation]]s for events that occur regularly or have already occurred.  Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has [[explanatory power]].

One early and influential theory of scientific explanation is the [[deductive-nomological]] model. It says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name="Hempel1948"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Wesley C. Salmon|Wesley Salmon]] developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained.&lt;ref name="Salmon1971"&gt;{{cite book

===Justifying science===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
[[File:Chicken farmer in Ghana (5926941911).jpg|thumb|The expectations chickens might form about farmer behavior illustrate the "problem of induction."]]
Although it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests.&lt;ref name="StanInduction"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/|title = The Problem of Induction|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Vickers|first1 = John|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use [[inductive reasoning]] to infer that the farmer will bring food ''every'' morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning?

One approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more [[Probability|probable]]. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is true. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are [[Bayesian probability|subjective]], or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.&lt;ref name=StanInduction/&gt;

Some argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather [[abductive reasoning]], or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the "best explanation." [[Ockham's razor]], which counsels choosing the [[Simplicity|simplest]] available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this [[heuristic]] principle more precise in terms of theoretical [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.&lt;ref name="StanSimple"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/|title = Simplicity|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Baker|first1 = Alan|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature.  In order to improve this problematic thesis, it needs to be represented in the form of a hierarchy of theses, each thesis becoming more insubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1998) [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press; (2017) [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress: Aim-Oriented Empiricism], Paragon House, St. Paul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation inseparable from theory===
[[Image:Einstein cross.jpg|thumb|right|A celestial object known as the [[Einstein Cross]].]]
When making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], observers would have likely interpreted the image at right as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and [[Gravitational lens|four different images]] of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be [[theory-laden]].&lt;ref name="StanTheoryObs"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/|title = Theory and Observation in Science|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Bogen|first1 = Jim|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All observation involves both [[philosophy of perception|perception]] and [[cognitive process|cognition]]. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.&lt;ref name=StanTheoryObs/&gt;

===The purpose of science===
{{See also|Scientific realism|Instrumentalism}}

Should science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science [[Empirical limits in science|cannot answer]]?  ''Scientific realists'' claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard [[scientific theories]] as true, approximately true, or likely true.  Conversely, ''scientific anti-realists'' argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about [[unobservable]]s like electrons or other universes.&lt;ref name="Levin1984"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalists]] argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.

Realists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories.&lt;ref name="Boyd2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specific examples include:

===Values and science===
Values intersect with science in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research. The scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitioners. Values emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society.

If it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="StanSocial"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title = The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|accessdate = 2014-03-06|last1 = Longino|first1 = Helen|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on [[evolution]], and values concerning [[social class]] influenced debates on [[phrenology]] (considered scientific at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allchin, "Values in Science and in Science Education," in International Handbook of Science Education, B.J. Fraser and K.G. Tobin (eds.), 2:1083–1092, Kluwer Academic Publishers (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist epistemology|Feminist philosophers of science]], sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.

==History==
{{See also|History of scientific method|History of science|History of philosophy}}

===Pre-modern===
The origins of philosophy of science trace back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also analyzed reasoning by [[analogy]]. The eleventh century Arab polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in Latin as [[Alhazen]]) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied [[geometry]], especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the [[Catoptrics|reflection]] and [[Dioptrics|refraction]] of light. [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=350–351|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=alhazen+philosophy+of+science#v=onepage&amp;q=alhazen%20philosophy%20of%20science&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian.

Carroll and Graf Publishers, NY, 2003, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]
[[Francis Bacon]] (no direct relation to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]]. In his work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) – an allusion to Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' – Bacon outlined a new [[system of logic]] to improve upon the old philosophical process of [[syllogism]]. Bacon's method relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon, Francis]] ''[[Novum Organum]] (The New Organon)'', 1620. Bacon's work described many of the accepted principles, underscoring the importance of empirical results, data gathering and experiment.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911), "[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bacon, Francis|Bacon, Francis]]" states: [In Novum Organum, we ] "proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, the process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the non-essential,&amp;nbsp;..., is the most important of Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', advocating the central role of [[rationalism|reason]] as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' argued that "...&amp;nbsp;hypotheses&amp;nbsp;... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction.

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
[[Instrumentalism]] became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces [[verificationism]] (a set of [[epistemology|theories of knowledge]] that combines [[logicism]], [[empiricism]], and [[linguistics]] to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the [[empirical sciences]]). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new ''scientific philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and the [[Vienna Circle]] propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.

Interpreting [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|philosophy of language]], logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness.  From [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]]—whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology—and [[Percy Bridgman]]'s [[operationalism]]. Thereby, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific and ''cognitively meaningful'', whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless "pseudostatements"—metaphysical, emotive, or such—not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.

Logical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable—even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles—but that is an exaggeration.  Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional.  ''Theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws'', while ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules''.   Mathematics in physics would reduce to [[symbolic logic]] via logicism, while [[rational reconstruction]] would convert [[natural language|ordinary language]] into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could verify its falsity or truth.

In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of "causation".  The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated [[Anglosphere]] philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1301-6 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-06606-7 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—[[neo-Thomisism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[intuitionism]], dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and [[existentialism]]. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C.

Nevertheless, it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy, with Carl Hempel playing a key role.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Epicycle and deferent.svg|thumb|For [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], the addition of [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] in Ptolemaic astronomy was "normal science" within a paradigm, whereas the [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions#The Copernican Revolution|Copernican revolution]] was a paradigm shift.]]

===Thomas Kuhn===
{{Main|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}}

In the 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. A paradigm also encompasses the set of questions and practices that define a scientific discipline. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure [[scientific progress]] across paradigms.

For Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.

==Current approaches==
===Naturalism's axiomatic assumptions===
All scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Priddy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitehead|1997|p=135}} ,  “All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.”&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]] concurs that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the only paradigm.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality.&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is the implicit philosophy of working scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strahler|1992|p=3}} The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;/ref&gt; The following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed." "Our belief that objective reality exist is an assumption that it arises from a real world outside of ourselves.  As infants we made this assumption unconsciously.   People are happy to make this assumption that adds meaning to our sensations and feelings, than live with [[solipsism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them.

#''that reality can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.''{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} Stanley Sobottka said, "The assumption of external reality is necessary for science to function and to flourish.

# ''that Nature has uniformity of laws and most if not all things in nature must have at least a natural cause.''{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}}  Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] referred to these two closely related propositions as the [[Uniformitarianism|constancy of nature's laws]] and the operation of known processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=120}}, "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of known processes.

===Coherentism===
{{main|Coherentism}}
[[File:JeremiahHorrocks.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremiah Horrocks]] makes the first observation of the transit of Venus in 1639, as imagined by the artist [[William Richard Lavender|W.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Lavender]] in 1903]]

In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/justep-coherence/|title = Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Olsson|first = Erik|year = 2014|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prediction of a [[transit of Venus]] is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the [[optics]] of telescopes, the [[mechanics]] of the telescope mount, and an understanding of [[celestial mechanics]]. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In fact, according to the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]], after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]], it is impossible to test a theory in isolation.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Dunhem–Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's Law of Gravitation]] in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets.  Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of [[Uranus]] in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, [[Neptune]]. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One consequence of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ''ad hoc'' hypotheses. [[Karl Popper]] accepted this thesis, leading him to reject [[Falsifiability#Naïve falsification|naïve falsification]]. Instead, he favored a "survival of the fittest" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred.&lt;ref name="Popper 2005ch3-4"&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Popper

===Anything goes methodology===

{{Main|Epistemological anarchism}}

[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]]]]

[[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the progress of science. He argued that "the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: ''anything goes''".&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;Paul Feyerabend, ''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'' (1975), {{ISBN|0-391-00381-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-222-1}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-481-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-646-4}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-934-X}}, {{ISBN|0-902308-91-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus had become increasingly an [[ideology]]. Because of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology of scientific knowledge methodology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
According to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a community.&lt;ref name="KuhnPostParadigm"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kuhn, T. S.| chapter = [Postscript] | title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd. ed | publisher = [Univ. of Chicago Pr] | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | authorlink = Thomas Samuel Kuhn|page = 176|quote = A paradigm is what the members of a community of scientists share, ''and'', conversely, a scientific community consists of men who share a paradigm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].

However, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer&amp;nbsp;... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as ''cultural posits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Quine, Willard Van Orman| chapter = Two Dogmas of Empiricism | title = From a Logical Point of View | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1980 | isbn = 978-0-674-32351-3 | url = http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the [[science wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last= Ashman|editor1-first= Keith M.|editor2-last= Barringer|editor2-first= Philip S.|title= After the Science Wars|date= 2001|publisher= Routledge|location= London, UK|isbn= 978-0-415-21209-0|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=After+the+science+wars#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20the%20science%20wars&amp;f=false|accessdate= 29 October 2015|quote= The 'war' is between scientists who believe that science and its methods are objective, and an increasing number of social scientists, historians, philosophers, and others gathered under the umbrella of Science Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including [[David Bloor]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Anselm Strauss]]. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from [[Economics of scientific knowledge|economics have also been applied]]{{by whom|date=October 2017}} for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has come to be known as [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Here the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate.

===Continental philosophy===
Philosophers in the [[continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]] are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] advanced the thesis in his "The Genealogy of Morals" that the motive for search of truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatab|first1=Lawrence J.|title=How Does the Ascetic Ideal Function in Nietzsche's ''Genealogy''?|journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies|date=2008|issue=35/36|page=107|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v035/35.hatab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In general, science in continental philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective.  One of the first philosophers who supported this view was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Gaston Bachelard]] also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the late works of [[Merleau-Ponty]] (''Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France'', 1956–1960), and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name="Gutting"&gt;Gutting, Gary (2004), ''Continental Philosophy of Science'', Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the [[present-at-hand|theoretical attitude]] in general which of course includes the scientific attitude.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2015"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/|title = Martin Heidegger|accessdate = 2015-10-29|last = Wheeler|first = Michael|year = 2015|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, [[Alexandre Koyré]].  Another important development was that of Michel [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s analysis of the historical and scientific thought in ''[[The Order of Things]]'' and his study of power and corruption within the "science" of [[Insanity|madness]]. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include [[Jürgen Habermas]] (e.g., "Truth and Justification", 1998), [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and [[Wolfgang Stegmüller]] ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).

==Other topics==
===Reductionism===

[[Analysis]] is the activity of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand it. [[Reductionism]] can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="StanUnity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/|title = The Unity of Science|accessdate = 2014-03-01|last1 = Cat|first1 = Jordi|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls ''[[greedy reductionism]],'' which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=George|title=Darwin Loves You: Natural Selection and the Re-enchantment of the World|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13639-4|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=koy-zqecyewC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=dennett+%22greedy+reductionism%22+%22bad+science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=dennett%20%22greedy%20reductionism%22%20%22bad%20science%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social accountability===
{{See also|The Mismeasure of Man}}
A broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, what part of the world and man is studied by science. [[Philip Kitcher]] in his "Science, Truth, and Democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P. Science, Truth, and Democracy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.

In addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.&lt;ref name="StanPhilNeuro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/neuroscience/ |title = The Philosophy of Neuroscience |last1 = Bickle|first1 = John|last2 = Mandik|first2 = Peter|last3 = Landreth|first3 = Anthony|year = 2010 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|postscript= (Summer 2010 Edition) |editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the typical test yields a [[p-value]], which is the probability of the ''evidence'' being such as it is, under the assumption that the hypothesis being tested is true. If the ''p''-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, [[Bayesian inference]] seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include [[probability interpretations]], [[overfitting]], and the difference between [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation and causation]].

Is asking whether "1+1=2" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was [[calculus]] invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires [[A priori and a posteriori|experience or reason alone]]. What does it mean to prove a mathematical [[theorem]] and how does one know whether a [[mathematical proof]] is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and [[logic]], human capabilities such as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]], and the [[material universe]].

===Philosophy of physics===
{{Main|Philosophy of physics}}
{{unsolved|physics|How does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] description of reality, which includes elements such as the "[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states" and "[[wavefunction collapse]]", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}
Philosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions underlying modern [[physics]], the study of [[matter]] and [[energy]] and how they [[interaction|interact]]. The main questions concern the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]], [[atom]]s and [[atomism]]. Also included are the predictions of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]], [[causality (physics)|causality]], [[determinism]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Philosophy of chemistry===
{{Main|Philosophy of chemistry}}
Philosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the [[methodology]] and content of the science of [[chemistry]]. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by [[quantum mechanics]] or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of [[Philosophy of science#Confirmation of theories|how theories are confirmed]] in the context of confirming [[reaction mechanism]]s. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of.&lt;ref name="WeisbergEtal2011"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chemistry/|title = Philosophy of Chemistry|accessdate = 2014-02-14|last1 = Weisberg|first1 = Michael|last2 = Needham|first2 = Paul|last3 = Hendry|first3 = Robin|year = 2011|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as [[chemical bonds]].

===Philosophy of Earth sciences===
The philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth). Earth scientists’ ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system.

===Philosophy of biology===
{{Main|Philosophy of biology}}
Philosophy of biology deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[ethics|ethical]] issues in the [[Biology|biological]] and [[Medical research|biomedical]] sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hull D. (1969), What philosophy of biology is not, Journal of the History of Biology, 2, p.&amp;nbsp;241–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].  Other key ideas such as the [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] of all life processes to [[biochemical]] reactions as well as the incorporation of [[psychology]] into a broader [[neuroscience]] are also addressed. Research in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]]'s work),&lt;ref&gt;Recent examples include Okasha S. (2006), ''Evolution and the Levels of Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, and Godfrey-Smith P. (2009), ''Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomes. As a consequence the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Witzany G. (2010). "Biocommunication and Natural Genome Editing". Dortrecht: Springer Sciences and Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of medicine===
{{Main|Philosophy of medicine}}

Beyond [[medical ethics]] and [[bioethics]], the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]] of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation,&lt;ref name="Papineau 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papineau | first1 = D | year = 1994 | title = The Virtues of Randomization | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 437–450 | doi=10.1093/bjps/45.2.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2002"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3081103 Jstor], Worrall, J., 2002.

Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomena.

===Philosophy of psychology===
{{Main|Philosophy of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]
Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of [[behaviorism|behavior]] to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on [[mentalism (psychology)|mental perception and thought processes]]?&lt;ref name="Routpsych"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Mason|first1 = Kelby|first2 = Chandra Sekhar|last2 = Sripada|first3 = Stephen|last3 = Stich|title = Routledge Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophy|chapter = Philosophy of Psychology|chapterurl = http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/PHILOSOPHYofPSYCHOLOGY.pdf|editor-last = Moral|editor-first = Dermot|publisher = Routledge|location = London|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a [[Likert scale]], they may be experiencing very different things.

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]]. For example, are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?&lt;ref name="Routpsych" /&gt; Is there any sense in which they have [[free will]], and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, [[neurophilosophy]] has just recently become its own field with the works of [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;ref name=StanPhilNeuro/&gt; Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]]. Another related field is [[philosophy of language]].

A notable recent development in Philosophy of Psychology is [[Functional contextualism|Functional Contextualism]] or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general, the field of [[behavior analysis]], and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT).&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

===Philosophy of psychiatry===
{{main|Philosophy of psychiatry}}
Philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/psychiatry/ Philosophy of Psychiatry]". ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', edited by Edward N. Zalta. Accessed 18 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of economics===
{{Main|Philosophy and economics}}
Philosophy of economics is the branch of philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to [[economics]]. It can also be defined as the branch of economics which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/ |title=Philosophy of Economics|last1=Hausman |first1=Daniel |last2= |first2= |date= December 18, 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods rise to the level of epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society?

===Philosophy of social science===
{{Main|Philosophy of social science}}
The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the [[social sciences]], such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Hollis |author-link=Martin Hollis (philosopher)|year=1994 |title=The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-44780-5 |url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

The French philosopher, [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of [[positivism]] in ''The Course in Positivist Philosophy'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]: "''[[sociology|sociologie]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte]&lt;/ref&gt; For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general '[[law of three stages]]'. These are (1) the ''theological'', (2) the ''metaphysical'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and [[social research]]. [[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The positivist perspective has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer [[bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as [[Thomas Kuhn]], and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]].  The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Pragmaticism'''" is a term used by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] for his pragmatic philosophy starting in 1905, in order [[stipulative definition|to distance himself and it]] from [[pragmatism]], the original name, which had been used in a manner he did not approve of in the "literary journals". Peirce in 1905 announced his coinage "pragmaticism", saying that it was "ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers" (''Collected Papers'' (CP) 5.414). Today, outside of philosophy, "pragmatism" is often taken to refer to a compromise of aims or principles, even a ruthless search for mercenary advantage. Peirce gave other or more specific reasons for the distinction in a surviving draft letter that year and in later writings. Peirce's pragmatism, that is, pragmaticism, differed in Peirce's view from other pragmatisms by its commitments to the spirit of strict logic, the immutability of truth, the reality of infinity, and the difference between (1) actively willing to control thought, to doubt, to weigh reasons, and (2) willing not to exert the will, willing to believe.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;Peirce (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, CP 6.452-485, EP 2:434-450, and elsewhere. See the discussion of pragmatism toward the end. Depending on the edition, it may appear in Section V or in an "additament" afterward.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view his pragmatism is, strictly speaking, not itself a whole philosophy, but instead a general method for the clarification of ideas. He first publicly formulated his pragmatism as an aspect of scientific logic along with [[Founders of statistics|principles of statistics]] and modes of inference in his "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" series of articles in 1877-8.

==Pragmatic maxim==

Whether one chooses to call it "[[pragmatism]]" or "pragmaticism"—and Peirce himself was not always consistent about it even after the notorious renaming—his conception of pragmatic philosophy is based on one or another version of the so-called "[[pragmatic maxim]]".  Here is one of his more emphatic statements of it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pragmaticism was originally enounced in the form of a maxim, as follows:  Consider what effects, that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings, you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have.  Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object (CP 5.438).&lt;ref&gt;See p. 481 in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', vol. 15, pp. 481-499, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA481-IA20 Eprint], ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/details/monistquart15hegeuoft Eprint]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' (CP) v. 5, paragraphs 438-463, see 438, and in ''Charles S. Peirce: Selected Writings'', pp. 203-226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1909 ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'', the entry for pragmaticism, written, it now appears, by John Dewey,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce had primary responsibility in the ''Century Dictionary'' for terms in logic, philosophy and other fields, see B:139. "Pragmatism" and presumably "pragmaticism" were among the words in Peirce's charge in the ''Century Dictionary'' - see under "[http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=P P] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002082422/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=P |date=2011-10-02 }}" in the list of words at [http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep PEP-UQÀM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211228/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep |date=2011-07-06 }}, the Peirce Edition Project's branch at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM), which is working on [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings]] v. 7: Peirce's work on the ''Century Dictionary''. However, [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M. Ransdell]] reported that PEP-UQÀM's director François Latraverse informed him that [[John Dewey]] actually wrote the ''Supplement''s definitions of "pragmatic", "pragmatism", etc. See [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.philosophy.peirce/6 Ransdell's 2006 January 13 post] to peirce-l.&lt;/ref&gt; was

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''pragmaticism''' (prag-mat'''′''' i-sizm), ''&lt;abbr title=noun&gt;n.&lt;/abbr&gt;'' [''pragmatic'' + ''ism''.] A special and limited form of pragmatism, in which the pragmatism is restricted to the determining of the meaning of concepts (particularly of philosophic concepts) by consideration of the experimental differences in the conduct of life which would conceivably result from the affirmation or denial of the meaning in question. &lt;blockquote style="margin-top:0;font-size:94%"&gt;He [the writer] framed the theory that a conception, that is, the rational purport of a word or other expression, lies exclusively in its conceivable bearing upon the conduct of life.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. To serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word "''pragmaticism''." &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Peirce'', in The Monist, April, 1905, p.&amp;nbsp;166. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Pragmatism's origin==

Pragmatism as a philosophical movement originated in 1872 in discussions in [[The Metaphysical Club]] among Peirce, [[William James]], [[Chauncey Wright]], [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]], [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]], [[Nicholas St. John Green]], and [[Joseph Bangs Warner]].  The first use in print of the name ''pragmatism'' appears to have been in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with having coined the name during the early 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;As Brent (B:86) points out, in a letter November 10, 1900 (CP 8:253) to James, Peirce wrote:{{quote|Now, however, I have a particular occasion to write. Baldwin, arrived at J in his dictionary, suddenly calls on me to do the rest of the logic, in the utmost haste, and various questions of terminology come up. &lt;br&gt;Who originated the term ''pragmatism'', I or you? Where did it first appear in print? What do you understand by it?}}
to which James replied (CP 8:253 footnote 8) on a post card dated November 26, 1900, Widener Library (Cambridge, Massachusetts) VB2a:{{quote|You invented 'pragmatism' for which I gave you full credit in a lecture entitled 'Philosophical conceptions and practical results' of which I sent you 2 (unacknowledged) copies a couple of years ago.}}
As Brent also points out (B:88), Peirce — or as Peirce scholars recently say, Dewey ([[#Dewey|see above]]) — in the 1909 ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'' [[s:The Century Dictionary/Volume 12/P|definition of pragmatism]] (''Wikisource''), wrote: {{quote|In an article for "The Monist" for 1905, Mr. Peirce says that he "has used it continually in philosophical conversation since, perhaps, the mid-seventies." The term was publicly introduced in print by Professor William James in 1898 in an address upon "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Realities," in which authorship of the term and of the method is credited to Mr. Peirce.}}
James, William (1898), "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results", delivered before the Philosophical Union of the University of California at Berkeley, August 26, 1898, and first printed in the ''University Chronicle'' 1, September 1898, pp. 287-310. ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/n4/mode/1up Eprint]. On [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/290/mode/1up p. 290]:: {{quote|I refer to Mr. Charles S. Peirce, with whose very existence as a philosopher I dare say many of you are unacquainted. He is one of the most original of contemporary thinkers; and the principle of practicalism or pragmatism, as he called it, when I first heard him enunciate it at Cambridge in the early 70s is the clue or compass by following which I find myself more and more confirmed in believing we may keep our feet upon the proper trail.}}
James credited Peirce again the 1901-1902 Gifford Lectures that were published as ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' (p. 444), and then in the 1906 lectures that were published in 1907 as ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', see Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

James, among others, regarded Peirce's 1877-8 "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" series, especially "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) as [[pragmatism]]'s foundation.&lt;ref&gt;See James (1897), ''Will to Believe'' (which James dedicated to Peirce), see p. 124 and footnote via ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=wRMXL4uYEegC&amp;pg=PA124 Eprint]: {{quote|Indeed, it may be said that if two apparently different definitions of the reality before us should have identical consequences, those two definitions would really be identical definitions, made delusively to appear different merely by the different verbiage in which they are expressed.¹&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;¹ See the admirably original "Illustrations of the Logic of Science," by C. S. Peirce, especially the second paper, "How to make our Thoughts clear," {{sic}} in the Popular Science Monthly for January, 1878.}} See also James's 1907 ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce (CP 5.11-12), like James&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1907) ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method of thinking and resolving dilemmas. Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.

In a 1906 manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "The Founding of Pragmatism", manuscript written 1906, published in ''The Hound &amp; Horn: A Harvard Miscellany'' v. II, n. 3, April–June 1929, pp. 282–5, see 283–4, reprinted 1934 as "Historical Affinities and Genesis" in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, paragraphs 11–13, see 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote that, in the Metaphysical Club decades earlier, Nicholas St. John Green&lt;blockquote&gt;often urged the importance of applying [[Alexander Bain|Bain]]'s definition of belief, as "that upon which a man is prepared to act." From this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism.&lt;/blockquote&gt; James and Peirce, inspired by crucial links among belief, conduct, and [[disposition]], agreed with Green. [[John Shook]] has said, "Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and [[Fallibilism|fallibilist]] [[empiricism]] as a vital alternative to rationalistic speculation."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Shook|Shook, John]] (undated), "The Metaphysical Club", the ''Pragmatism Cybrary''. [http://www.pragmatism.org/research/metaphysical_club.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatism is regarded as a distinctively [[United States|American]] philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} As advocated by James, [[John Dewey]], [[F. C. S. Schiller]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and others, it has proved durable and popular. But Peirce did not seize on this fact to enhance his reputation, and even coined the word "pragmaticism" to distinguish his philosophical position.

==Clarification of ideas in inquiry==

Pragmatism starts with the idea that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is about conceptions of objects. His pragmatism is a method for fruitfully sorting out conceptual confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needful) formal yet not practical differences. It equates any conception of an object with a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of those conceived effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. Those conceivable practical implications are the conception's meaning. The meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the conception as true. Peirce's pragmaticism, in the strict sense, is about the conceptual elucidation of conceptions into such meanings — about how to make our ideas clear. Making them true, in the sense of proving and bearing them out in fruitful practice, goes beyond that. A conception's truth is its correspondence to the real, to that which would be found by investigation taken far enough. A conception's actual confirmation (if it occurs) is neither its meaning nor its truth ''per se'', but an actual upshot.

In "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]",&lt;ref&gt;See also "The Logic of Relatives," The ''Monist'', Vol. 7, 1897, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA161 161]-217 (via ''Google Books''). Reprinted in CP, v. 3, paragraphs 456-552.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce discusses three grades of clearness of conception: &lt;br&gt;
:1. Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.
:2. Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its definition's parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea ''distinct'', that is, clarified by analysis of just what elements make the given idea applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce calls such a definition "nominal" (CP 5.553).
:3. Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's effects as conceived of, such as can lead to fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduces that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]].

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. To reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the truth is independent of our vagaries of opinion and is discoverable. In clearness's second grade (the "nominal" grade), he defines truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object, and the real as the object (be it a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law) to which a true sign corresponds, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defines truth — not as actual consensus, such that to inquire would be to poll the experts — but as that which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.&lt;ref name=Induction&gt;"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead", in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1878 April), "The Probability of Induction", p. 718 (''Internet Archive'' ''[https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up Eprint]) ''in ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705-18. Reprinted (''Chance, Love, and Logic'', pp. 82-105), (CP 2.669-93), (''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'', pp. 174-89), (W 3:290-305), (EP 1:155-69).&lt;/ref&gt; (Peirce held that one cannot have absolute theoretical assurance of having actually reached the truth, and later said that the confession of inaccuracy and one-sidedness is an essential ingredient of a true abstract statement.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), "''Logical''" in "Truth and Falsity and Error", ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' v. 2, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Truth%20is%20that%20concordance%22 p. 718]. Reprinted CP v. 5, paragraphs 565-566.&lt;/ref&gt;) Peirce argues that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability. For more on Peirce's theory of truth, see the Peirce section in [[Pragmatic theory of truth#Peirce|Pragmatic theory of truth]]. Peirce's discussions and definitions of truth have influenced several epistemic truth theorists and been used as foil for [[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] and [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] theories of truth.

Peirce said that a conception's meaning consists in "[[Pragmatic maxim#2|all general modes of rational conduct]]" implied by "acceptance" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism, since a conception is general, does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth, nor does it equate its meaning, much less its truth (if it is true), with the conceived or actual benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true in what it purports. If it is true, its truth is not transitory but instead immutable and independent of actual trends of opinion. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to "vulgar" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage. Rather, Peirce's pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), CP 5.13 note 1&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification&lt;ref&gt;See CP 1.34 [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in "The Spirit of Scholasticism"), where Peirce attributes the success of modern science not so much to a novel interest in verification as to the improvement of verification.&lt;/ref&gt; to test the truth of putative knowledge.

Peirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of ''definitions and the clearness of ideas'', is a department within his theory of inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.cspeirce.com/homepage/ransdell.htm Joseph Ransdell]'s comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/intro/l75intro.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; which he variously called "Methodeutic" and "Philosophical or Speculative Rhetoric". He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.

Peirce called his pragmatism "the logic of [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1903), "Pragmatism — The Logic of Abduction", CP v. 5, paragraphs 195-205, especially paragraph 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the logic of inference to explanatory hypotheses. As a method conducive to hypotheses as well as predictions and testing, pragmatism leads beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives, namely:

:* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]'';

:* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.

His approach is distinct from [[foundationalism]], empiricist or otherwise, as well as from [[coherentism]], by the following three dimensions:

:* Active process of theory generation, with no prior assurance of truth;

:* Subsequent application of the contingent theory in order to clarify its logical and practical implications;

:* Testing and evaluation of the provisional theory's utility for the ''[[anticipation]]'' of future experience, and that in dual senses of the word: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''. Peirce's appreciation of these three dimensions serves to flesh out a [[physiognomy]] of inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''simpliciter'', which is merely the relabeling of phenomenological patterns.  Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.

A theory that proves itself more successful than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth employed by scientists.

In "[http://www.peirce.org/writings/p107.html The Fixation of Belief]", Peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to settle disturbances or conflicts of belief, irritating, inhibitory doubts, belief being that on which one is willing to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry not only as a special kind of inquiry in a broader spectrum, but also, like inquiry generally, as based on actual doubts, not mere verbal doubts (such as [[hyperbolic doubt]]), which he held to be fruitless, and it let him also frame it, by the same stroke, as requiring that proof rest on propositions free from actual doubt, rather than on ultimate and absolutely indubitable propositions. He outlined four methods, ordered from least to most successful in achieving a secure fixation of belief:
# The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness, but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views, as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well fail to avoid noticing when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.
# The method of authority — which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.
# The method of the ''a priori'' — which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The method of science — the only one whereby inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", 1898, Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published CP 1.616-48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), 105-22, reprinted in EP 2:27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be bound to the other methods and to practical ends; reason's "first rule" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1899), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], CP v. 1, paragraphs 135-40. [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; What recommends the scientific method of inquiry above all others is that it is deliberately designed to arrive, eventually, at the ultimately most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can eventually be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce shows how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

==Pragmaticism's name==

[[Image:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William James]]&lt;br&gt;1842–1910]] [[Image:FCSSchiller Slosson1917.jpg|thumb|upright|[[F. C. S. Schiller]]&lt;br&gt;1863–1937]]  It is sometimes stated that James' and other philosophers' use of the word ''pragmatism'' so dismayed Peirce that he renamed his own variant ''pragmaticism''. [[Susan Haack]] has disagreed,&lt;ref&gt;1998, ''Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate'', Chicago IL: University of Chicago Press, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out the context in which Peirce publicly introduced the latter term in 1905. Haack's excerpt of Peirce begins below at the words "But at present...," and continues with some ellipses. The fuller excerpt below supports her case further:
{{quote|[The] word "pragmatism" has gained general recognition in a generalised sense that seems to argue power of growth and vitality. The famed psychologist, [[William James|James]], first took it up, seeing that his "radical empiricism" substantially answered to the writer's definition of pragmatism, albeit with a certain difference in the point of view. Next, the admirably clear and brilliant thinker, Mr. [[F. C. S. Schiller|Ferdinand C. S. Schiller]], casting about for a more attractive name for the "anthropomorphism" of his ''Riddle of the Sphinx'', lit, in that most remarkable paper of his on ''Axioms as Postulates'', upon the same designation "pragmatism," which in its original sense was in generic agreement with his own doctrine, for which he has since found the more appropriate specification "humanism," while he still retains "pragmatism" in a somewhat wider sense. So far all went happily. But at present, the word begins to be met with occasionally in the literary journals, where it gets abused in the merciless way that words have to expect when they fall into literary clutches. Sometimes the manners of the British have effloresced in scolding at the word as ill-chosen, —ill-chosen, that is, to express some meaning that it was rather designed to exclude. So then, the writer, finding his bantling "pragmatism" so promoted, feels that it is time to kiss his child good-by and relinquish it to its higher destiny; while to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word "pragmaticism", which is ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, on p [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165]-166 in "What Pragmatism Is", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 2, April 1905, pp. 161-81, reprinted CP 5.411-37, see 5.414.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then, in a surviving draft letter to Calderoni, dated by the CP editors as ''circa'' that same year 1905, Peirce said regarding his above-quoted discussion:
{{quote|In the April number of the ''Monist'' I proposed that the word 'pragmatism' should hereafter be used somewhat loosely to signify affiliation with [[F. C. S. Schiller|Schiller]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], [[Josiah Royce|Royce]], and the rest of us, while the particular doctrine which I invented the word to denote, which is your first kind of pragmatism, should be called 'pragmaticism.' The extra syllable will indicate the narrower meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Signor Calderoni (c. 1905), CP 8.205. See under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/pragmaticism.html Pragmaticism] in the CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Indeed in the ''Monist'' article Peirce had said that the coinage "pragmaticism" was intended "to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition". Of course this does not mean that Peirce regarded his fellow pragmatist philosophers as word-kidnappers. To the contrary he had said, regarding James's and Schiller's uses of the word "pragmatism": "So far, all went happily." So it would seem that Peirce intended the coinage "pragmaticism" for two distinguishable purposes: (1) protection from literary journals and word-kidnappers, and (2) reference strictly to his own form of pragmatism, as opposed even to other pragmatisms that had not moved him to the new name. In the letter to Calderoni, Peirce did not reject all significant affiliation with fellow pragmatists, and instead said "the rest of us". Nor did he reject all such affiliation in later discussions.

However, in the following year 1906, in a manuscript "A Sketch of Logical Critics",&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 451-62, see pp. 457-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote:
{{quote|I have always fathered my pragmati&lt;/em&gt;ci&lt;/em&gt;sm (as I have called it since James and Schiller made the word [pragmatism] imply "the will to believe," the mutability of truth, the soundness of Zeno's refutation of motion, and pluralism generally), upon Kant, Berkeley, and Leibniz....}}
(Peirce proceeded to criticize J.&amp;nbsp;S. Mill but acknowledged probable aid from Mill's ''Examination''.)

Then, in 1908, in his article "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]",&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; mentioning both James and the journalist, pragmatist, and literary author [[Giovanni Papini]], Peirce wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1871, in a Metaphysical Club in Cambridge, Mass., I used to preach this principle as a sort of logical gospel, representing the unformulated method followed by Berkeley, and in conversation about it I called it "Pragmatism." In December 1877 and January 1878 I set forth the doctrine in the ''Popular Science Monthly'', and the two parts&lt;ref&gt;Peirce refers to "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" and "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]".&lt;/ref&gt; of my essay were printed in French in the ''Revue Philosophique'', volumes vi. and vii. Of course, the doctrine attracted no particular attention, for, as I had remarked in my opening sentence, very few people care for logic. But in 1897 Professor James remodelled the matter, and transmogrified it into a doctrine of philosophy, some parts of which I highly approved, while other and more prominent parts I regarded, and still regard, as opposed to sound logic. About the time Professor Papini discovered, to the delight of the Pragmatist school, that this doctrine was incapable of definition,&lt;ref&gt;See for example "What Pragmatism Is Like", a translation published in October 1907 in ''Popular Science Monthly'' v. 71, pp. 351–8. ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DKkWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 Eprint]. The original Italian: "Introduzione al pragmatismo", ''Leonardo'' series 3, ''anno'' 5, n. 1, February 1907, pp. 26-37, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DublAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA26 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; which would certainly seem to distinguish it from every other doctrine in whatever branch of science, I was coming to the conclusion that my poor little maxim should be called by another name; and accordingly, in April 1905, I renamed it ''Pragmaticism''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peirce proceeded in "A Neglected Argument" to express both deep satisfaction and deep dismay with his fellow pragmatists. He singled [[F. C. S. Schiller]] out by name and was vague about which among the others he most particularly referred to. Peirce wrote "It seems to me a pity they should allow a philosophy so instinct with life to become infected with seeds of death...."
{|
|-
| vAlign=top | Peirce remained allied with them about:
* the reality of generals and habits, to be understood, as are [[hypostatic abstraction]]s, in terms of potential concrete effects even if unactualized;
* the falsity of necessitarianism;
* the character of consciousness as only "visceral or other external sensation".
| vAlign=top | but was dismayed with their "angry hatred of strict logic" and saw seeds of philosophical death in:
* their view that "truth is mutable";
* their view that infinity is unreal; and
* "such confusions of thought as of active willing (willing to control thought, to doubt, and to weigh reasons) with willing not to exert the will (willing to believe)".
|}
There has been some controversy over Peirce's relation to other pragmatists over the years and over the question of what is owed to Peirce, with visible crests in titles such as literary essayist [[Edward Dahlberg]]'s "Cutpurse Philosopher"&lt;ref&gt;In ''Alms for Oblivion'', University of Minnesota Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; about James, in which Dahlberg claimed that Peirce had "tombstone reticences" about making accusations, and Kenneth Laine Ketner's and [[Walker Percy]]'s ''A Thief of Peirce'',&lt;ref&gt;University Press of Mississippi, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Percy described himself as "a thief of Peirce" (page 130). Meanwhile, Schiller, James's wife Alice, and James's son Henry James III believed that James had a habit of overstating his intellectual debts to others such as Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Gerald E., ''William James: His Life and Thought'', Yale University Press, 2001. See pp. 491-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another manuscript "A Sketch of Logical Critic" dated by the CP editors as 1911,&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt of it appears as "Achilles and the Tortoise" in CP 6.177-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce discussed one of [[Zeno's paradoxes]], that of Achilles and the Tortoise, in terms of James's and others' difficulties with it. Peirce therein expressed regret at having used a "contemptuous" manner about such difficulties in his 1903 Harvard lectures on pragmatism (which James had arranged), and said of James, who had died in August 1910: "Nobody has a better right to testify to the morality of his attitude toward his own thoughts than I, who knew and loved him for forty-nine or fifty years. But owing to his almost unexampled incapacity for mathematical thought, combined with intense hatred for logic — probably for its pedantry, its insistence on minute exactitude — the ''gêne'' of its barbarous formulations, etc. rendered him an easy victim to Zeno and the Achilles....",&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.182.&lt;/ref&gt; called James "about as perfect a lover of truth as it is possible for a man to be...."&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.183.&lt;/ref&gt; and said: "In speaking, then, of William James as I do, I am saying the most that I could of any man's intellectual morality; and with him this was but one of a whole diadem of virtues."&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process philosophy''' — also '''ontology of becoming''', '''processism''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Process Metaphysics: An Introduction to Process Philosophy'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''philosophy of organism'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy Emmet]], 1932, ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism'', London: Macmillan; 2nd edn, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; — identifies [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[reality]] with [[Change (philosophy)|change]]. In opposition to the classical model of change as illusory (as argued by Parmenides) or accidental (as argued by Aristotle), process philosophy regards change as the cornerstone of reality—the cornerstone of [[being]] thought of as [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]].

Since the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], philosophers have posited true reality as "timeless", based on permanent [[Substance theory|substance]]s, while processes are denied or subordinated to timeless substances. If [[Socrates]] changes, becoming sick, Socrates is still the same (the substance of Socrates being the same), and change (his sickness) only glides over his substance: change is accidental, whereas the substance is essential. Therefore, classic [[ontology]] denies any full reality to change, which is conceived as only accidental and not essential. This classical ontology is what made knowledge and a [[theory of knowledge]] possible, as it was thought that a science of something in becoming was an impossible feat to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fagot-Largeau, [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm 7 December 2006 course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} at the [[Collège of France]], first part of a series of courses on the "Ontology of Becoming" {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who appeal to process rather than substance include [[Heraclitus]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24196-marx-and-whitehead-process-dialectics-and-the-critique-of-capitalism/ Marx and Whitehead: Process, Dialectics, and the Critique of Capitalism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]],  [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Alfred Korzybski]], [[R. G. Collingwood]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Robert M. Pirsig]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Arran Gare]], [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. In physics, [[Ilya Prigogine]]&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prigogine, ''From being to becoming'', W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between the "physics of being" and the "physics of becoming". Process philosophy covers not just scientific intuitions and experiences, but can be used as a conceptual bridge to facilitate discussions among religion, philosophy, and science.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy R. Hustwit|title=Process Philosophy: 2.a. In Pursuit of a Holistic Worldview |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/#SH2a|publisher=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/6359324/Michel_Weber_ed._After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics_2004 After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to [[Continental philosophy]] than [[analytic philosophy]], because it is usually only taught in Continental departments.&lt;ref&gt;William Blattner, [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html "Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus Continental methods in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gaskill, A. J. Nocek, ''The Lure of Whitehead'', University of Minnesota Press, 2014, p. 4: "it is no wonder that Whitehead fell by the wayside. He was too scientific for the "continentals," not scientific enough for the "analytics," and too metaphysical—which is to say [[Critical philosophy|uncritical]]—for them both" and p. 231: "the analytics and Continentals are both inclined toward [[Kantianism|Kantian]] presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}

=== In ancient Greek thought ===

Heraclitus proclaimed that the basic nature of all things is change.

The quotation from [[Heraclitus]] appears in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' twice; in 401d as:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' Paragraph [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DCrat.%3Asection%3D401d Crat. 401 section d line 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|τὰ ὄντα ἰέναι τε πάντα καὶ μένειν οὐδέν}}&lt;br/&gt;''Ta onta ienai te panta kai menein ouden''&lt;br/&gt;"All entities move and nothing remains still"&lt;/blockquote&gt;and in 402a&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+402&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 Paragraph 402 section a line 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|"πάντα χωρεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" καὶ "δὶς ἐς τὸν αὐτὸν ποταμὸν οὐκ ἂν ἐμβαίης"}}&lt;br/&gt;''Panta chōrei kai ouden menei kai dis es ton auton potamon ouk an embaies''
&lt;br /&gt;"Everything changes and nothing remains still&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... you cannot step twice into the same stream"&lt;ref&gt;This sentence has been translated by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in Epistulae, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep6.shtml VI, 58, 23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus considered fire as the most fundamental element.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=William|title=Heraclitus: The Complete Philosophical Fragments|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/Heraclitus.html|website=Middlebury College|accessdate=3 October 2015|ref=DK B90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is an interpretation of Heraclitus's concepts into modern terms by Nicholas Rescher.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...reality is not a constellation of things at all, but one of processes.  The fundamental "stuff" of the world is not material substance, but volatile flux, namely "fire", and all things are versions thereof (puros tropai).  Process is fundamental: the river is not an object, but a continuing flow; the sun is not a thing, but an enduring fire.  Everything is a matter of process, of activity, of change (panta rhei)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=Process philosophy a survey of basic issues|date=2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=[Pittsburgh]|isbn=0822961288|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early expression of this viewpoint is in [[Heraclitus]]'s fragments. He posits strife, ''ἡ ἔρις'' (strife, conflict), as the underlying basis of all reality defined by change.&lt;ref&gt;Wheelwright, P. (1959). ''Heraclitus'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-924022-1}}, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance and opposition in strife were the foundations of change and stability in the flux of existence.

===Twentieth century===
In early twentieth century, the [[philosophy of mathematics]] was undertaken to develop mathematics as an airtight, axiomatic system in which every truth could be derived logically from a set of axioms. In the [[foundations of mathematics]], this project is variously understood as [[logicism]] or as part of the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] program of [[David Hilbert]]. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to complete, or at least facilitate, this program with their seminal book [[Principia Mathematica]], which purported to build a logically consistent [[set theory]] on which to found mathematics. After this, Whitehead extended his interest to natural science, which he held needed a deeper philosophical basis. He intuited that natural science was struggling to overcome a traditional ontology of timeless material substances that does not suit natural phenomena. According to Whitehead, material is more properly understood as 'process'. In 1929, he produced the most famous work of process philosophy, ''[[Process and Reality]]'',&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; continuing the work begun by [[Hegel]] but describing a more complex and fluid dynamic ontology.

Process thought describes truth as "movement" in and through substance ([[Hegelian]] truth), rather than [[substance theory|substances]] as fixed concepts or "things" ([[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] truth). Since Whitehead, process thought is distinguished from [[Hegel]] in that it describes entities that arise or coalesce in ''becoming'', rather than being simply dialectically determined from prior posited determinates. These entities are referred to as ''complexes of occasions of experience''. It is also distinguished in being not necessarily conflictual or oppositional in operation. Process may be integrative, destructive or both together, allowing for aspects of interdependence, influence, and confluence, and addressing coherence in universal as well as particular developments, i.e., those aspects not befitting Hegel's system. Additionally, instances of determinate occasions of experience, while always ephemeral, are nonetheless seen as important to define the type and continuity of those occasions of experience that flow from or relate to them.

==Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''==
[[Alfred North Whitehead]] began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined [[Harvard University]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/|title= Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925), Whitehead noted that the human intuitions and experiences of science, aesthetics, ethics, and religion influence the worldview of a community, but that in the last several centuries science dominates [[Western culture]]. Whitehead sought a holistic, comprehensive [[Cosmology (philosophy)|cosmology]] that provides a systematic descriptive theory of the world which can be used for the diverse human intuitions gained through ethical, aesthetic, religious, and scientific experiences, and not just the scientific.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"/&gt;

Whitehead's influences were not restricted to philosophers or physicists or mathematicians. He was influenced by the French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), whom he credits along with [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] in the preface to ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929). ''Process and Reality'', Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process metaphysics===

For Whitehead, metaphysics is about logical frameworks for the conduct of discussions of the character of the world. It is not directly and immediately about facts of nature, but only indirectly so, in that its task is to explicitly formulate the language and conceptual presuppositions that are used to describe the facts of nature. Whitehead thinks that discovery of previously unknown facts of nature can in principle call for reconstruction of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929), pp. 13, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process metaphysics elaborated in ''[[Process and Reality]]''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; posits an ontology which is based on the two kinds of existence of [[entity]], that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or [[abstraction]], also called 'object'.&lt;ref&gt;Palter, R.M. (1960). ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Science'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actual entity''' is a term coined by Whitehead to refer to the entities that really exist in the natural world.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"&gt;Robert Audi. 1995, ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.'' Cambridge: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge. 851–853.&lt;/ref&gt; For Whitehead, actual entities are spatiotemporally extended events or processes.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; An actual entity is how something is happening, and how its happening is related to other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The actually existing world is a multiplicity of actual entities overlapping one another.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

The ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is '''creativity'''. Creativity is a term coined by Whitehead to show a power in the world that allows the presence of an actual entity, a new actual entity, and multiple actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; Creativity is the principle of novelty.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with the term 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognizes singular causality as [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient causality]]. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it till it rang.

An actual entity is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#IX: Theta|changeable entities]] considered in terms of singular causality, about which categorical statements can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, ''qua'' actual entities, with a single exception.

For example, for [[Aristotle]], the actual entities were the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#Summary#Zeta|substance]]s, such as Socrates. Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in the [[Monadology|monads]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], which are said to be 'windowless'.

====Whitehead's actual entities====

For Whitehead's ontology of processes as defining the world, the actual entities exist as the only fundamental elements of reality.

The actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.

With one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are '''temporal''' and are '''[[wiktionary:actual occasions|occasions of experience]]''' (which are not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete [[object (philosophy)|object]], or that Aristotle would think of as a substance, is, in this ontology, considered to be a temporally serial composite of indefinitely many overlapping occasions of experience. A human being is thus composed of indefinitely many occasions of experience.

The one exceptional actual entity is at once both temporal and '''atemporal''': God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object.

The occasions of experience are of four grades. The first grade comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter; "matter" being the composite overlapping of occasions of experience from the previous grade. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the [[qualia]] of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions of the grades one, two, and three, lack that aspect.

There is no [[Mind-body dualism|mind-matter duality]] in this ontology, because "mind" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental aspect and the material aspect are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as ''persistent physical objects'', neither being actual entities. Though not recognized by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by [[Galen]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, R. E. (1973). ''Galen: On Psychology, Psychopathology, and Function and Diseases of the Nervous System. An Analysis of his Doctrines, Observations, and Experiments'', Karger, Basel, {{ISBN|978-3-8055-1479-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.

=====Time, causality, and process=====

Inherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each Whiteheadean occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows it in time; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' monads. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them. This is the process in process philosophy.

Such process is never deterministic. Consequently, [[free will]] is essential and inherent to the universe.

The causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be [[Spacetime#Basic concepts#Space-like interval|spatially separated]]. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of [[special relativity]] and with the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski geometry]] of spacetime.&lt;ref name="Naber"&gt;Naber, G. L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime. An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-387-97848-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1919"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1919). ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''[[Process and Reality]]''. Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.

=====Atomicity=====

The actual entities, the occasions of experience, are logically '''atomic''' in the sense that an occasion of experience cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatio-temporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this kind of atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain each of indefinitely many other actual entities.

Another aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but it is itself unchangeable.

The reader should bear in mind that the atomicity of the actual entities is of a simply logical or philosophical kind, thoroughly different in concept from the natural kind of atomicity that describes the [[atom]]s of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].

=====Topology=====

Whitehead's theory of extension was concerned with the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of velocity. The measurement of a velocity requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can '''overlap''' in Minkowski space.

Nexus is a term coined by Whitehead to show the network actual entity from universe. In the universe of actual entities spread&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; actual entity. Actual entities are clashing with each other and form other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The birth of an actual entity based on an actual entity, actual entities around him referred to as nexus.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;

An example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an '''enduring physical object''', which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object has a temporally earliest and a temporally last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) of such a nexus is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last member of the nexus. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nexūs, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.

In some contexts, especially in the [[theory of relativity]] in physics, the word 'event' refers to a single point in Minkowski or in Riemannian space-time. A point event is not a process in the sense of Whitehead's metaphysics. Neither is a countable sequence or array of points. A Whiteheadian process is most importantly characterized by extension in space-time, marked by a continuum of uncountably many points in a Minkowski or a Riemannian space-time. The word 'event', indicating a Whiteheadian actual entity, is not being used in the sense of a point event.

====Whitehead's abstractions====

Whitehead's '''abstractions''' are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities. They are the only entities that can be real but are not actual entities. This statement is one form of Whitehead's 'ontological principle'.

An abstraction is a conceptual entity that refers to more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a '''nexus''' emphasizes some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasized or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasized or left out or left behind.

'Eternal object' is a term coined by Whitehead. It is an abstraction, a possibility, or pure potential. It can be ingredient into some actual entity.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is a principle that can give a particular form to an actual entity.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004 ({{ISBN|3-937202-49-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an '''eternal object''' is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree of abstraction. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.

====Relation between actual entities and abstractions stated in the ontological principle====

For Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract '''ingredient''' eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.

Whitehead's '''ontological principle''' is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.

====Causation and concrescence of a process====
Concrescence is a term coined by Whitehead to show the process of jointly forming an actual entity that was without form, but about to manifest itself into an entity Actual full (''satisfaction'') based on datums or for information on the universe.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; The process of forming an actual entity is the case based on the existing datums. Concretion process can be regarded as ''subjectification process.''&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;John B. Cobb and David Ray Griffin. 1976, ''Process Theology, An Introduction. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Datum is a term coined by Whitehead to show the different variants of information possessed by actual entity. In process philosophy, datum is obtained through the events of concrescence. Every actual entity has a variety of datum.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

==Commentary on Whitehead and on process philosophy==
Whitehead is not an [[idealism|idealist]] in the strict sense.{{which|date=May 2013}} Whitehead's thought may be regarded as related to the idea of [[panpsychism]] (also known as panexperientialism, because of Whitehead's emphasis on experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seager|first1=William|title=Whitehead and the Revival (?) of Panpsychism|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm|website=University of Toronto Scarborough|publisher=University of Toronto at Scarborough|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On God ===
Whitehead's philosophy is very complex, subtle and nuanced and in order to comprehend his thinking regarding what is commonly referred to by many religions as "God", it is recommended that one read from ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'', wherein regarding "God" the authors elaborate Whitehead's conception.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He is the unconditioned actuality of conceptual feeling at the base of things; so that by reason of this primordial actuality, there is an order in the relevance of eternal objects to the process of creation (343 of 413) (Location 7624 of 9706 Kindle ed.)  Whitehead continues later with, "The particularities of the actual world presuppose it ; while it merely presupposes the general metaphysical character of creative advance, of which it is the primordial exemplification (344 of 413) (Location 7634 of 9706 Kindle Edition)." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Process philosophy, might be considered according to some theistic forms of religion to give a [[God#Process theology and process philosophy definition of God|God]] a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. Regarding Whitehead's use of the term, "occasions" in reference to, "God" it is explained in ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;"'Actual entities'-also termed 'actual occasions'-are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything [28] more real.  They differ among themselves: God is an actual entity, and so is the most trivial puff of existence in far-off empty space.  But, though there are gradations of importance, and diversities of function, yet in the principles which actuality exemplifies all are on the same level.  The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It can be also be assumed within some forms of theology that a God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them and this might lead to it being argued that Whitehead endorses some form of [[panentheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=John W.|title=Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|date=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=978-0801049316|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aokfbkOdjuEC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=Whitehead++panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilv8Xpxb7UAhVGOCYKHaBCB-UQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Whitehead%20%20panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, it is argued theologically, that "free will" is inherent to the nature of the universe, Whitehead's God is not omnipotent in Whitehead's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dombrowski|first1=Daniel A.|title=Whitehead's Religious Thought: From Mechanism to Organism, From Force to Persuasion|date=2017|publisher=State Univ of New York Pr|location=Albany|isbn=978-1438464299|pages=33–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACKRDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Whitehead%27s+God+is+not+omnipotent&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God's role is to offer enhanced occasions of experience. God participates in the evolution of the universe by offering possibilities, which may be accepted or rejected. Whitehead's thinking here has given rise to [[process theology]], whose prominent advocates include [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], and [[Hans Jonas]], who was also influenced by the non-theological philosopher Martin Heidegger. However, other process philosophers have questioned Whitehead's theology, seeing it as a regressive Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hustwit|first1=J. R.|title=Process Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead enumerated three essential ''natures of God''. The ''primordial'' nature of God consists of all potentialities of existence for actual occasions, which Whitehead dubbed eternal objects. God can offer possibilities by ordering the relevance of eternal objects. The ''consequent'' nature of God prehends everything that happens in reality. As such, God experiences all of reality in a sentient manner. The last nature is the ''superjective''. This is the way in which God's synthesis becomes a sense-datum for other actual entities. In some sense, God is prehended by existing actual entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viney|first1=Donald|title=Process Theism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosoph|publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and applications ==
=== Biology ===
In [[plant morphology]], [[Rolf Sattler]] developed a process morphology (dynamic morphology) that overcomes the structure/process (or structure/function) dualism that is commonly taken for granted in biology. According to process morphology, structures such as leaves of plants do not have processes, they ''are'' processes.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1990. "Towards a more dynamic plant morphology". ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 38: 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1992. "Process morphology: structural dynamics in development and evolution". ''[[Canadian Journal of Botany]]'' 70: 708–714.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolution]] and in [[Developmental biology|development]], the nature of the changes of biological objects are considered by many authors to be more radical than in physical systems. In biology, changes are not just changes of state in a pre-given space, instead the space and more generally the mathematical structures required to understand object change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montévil|first=Maël|last2=Mossio|first2=Matteo|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|last4=Longo|first4=Giuseppe|date=2016-10-01|year=|title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation|url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches|volume=122|issue=1|pages=36–50|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588/No_entailing_laws_but_enablement_in_the_evolution_of_the_biosphere|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
With its perspective that everything is interconnected, that all life has value, and that non-human entities are also experiencing subjects, process philosophy has played an important role in discourse on ecology and sustainability. The first book to connect process philosophy with environmental ethics was [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]]'s 1971 work, ''Is It Too Late: A Theology of Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Is It Too Late"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |title=Is It Too Late?: A Theology of Ecology |date=1971 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |isbn=978-0028012803 |url=https://www.amazon.com/too-late-theology-ecology/dp/0962680737}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent book (2018) edited by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]] and Wm. Andrew Schwartz, ''Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization''&lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm. Andrew |title=Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization |date=2018 |publisher=Process Century Press |location=Minnesota |isbn=978-1940447339 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Philosophy-Work-Ecological-Civilization/dp/194044733X}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributors explicitly explore the ways in which process philosophy can be put to work to address the most urgent issues facing our world today, by contributing to a transition toward an ecological civilization. That book emerged out of the largest international conference held on the theme of [[ecological civilization]] (''Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization'') which was organized by the Center for Process Studies in June 2015. The conference brought together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featured such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified August 24, 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[ecological civilization]] is often affiliated with the process philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]--especially in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Zhihe |last2=Huili |first2=He |last3=Meijun |first3=Fan |title=The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ |website=Monthly Review |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], some of Whitehead's ideas re-emerged in combination with [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] as the [[cognitive science of mathematics]] and [[embodied mind]] theses.

Somewhat earlier, exploration of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] from the 1950s to 1980s had sought alternatives to [[metamathematics]] in social behaviours around [[mathematics]] itself: for instance, [[Paul Erdős]]'s simultaneous belief in [[Platonism]] and a single "big book" in which all proofs existed, combined with his personal obsessive need or decision to collaborate with the widest possible number of other mathematicians. The process, rather than the outcomes, seemed to drive his explicit behaviour and odd use of language, as if the synthesis of Erdős and collaborators in seeking proofs, creating sense-datum for other mathematicians, was itself the expression of a divine will. Certainly, Erdős behaved as if nothing else in the world mattered, including money or love, as emphasized in his biography ''[[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]''.

=== Medicine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Several fields of science and especially [[medicine]] seem {{vague|date=May 2013}} to make liberal use of ideas in process philosophy, notably the theory of [[pain]] and [[healing]] of the late 20th century. The [[Philosophy of healthcare|philosophy of medicine]] began to deviate somewhat from [[scientific method]] and an emphasis on repeatable results in the very late 20th century by embracing [[Health system|population thinking]], and a more pragmatic approach to issues in [[public health]], [[environmental health]] and especially [[mental health]]. In this latter field, [[R. D. Laing]], [[Thomas Szasz]] and [[Michel Foucault]] were instrumental in moving medicine away from emphasis on "cures" and towards concepts of individuals in balance with their society, both of which are changing, and against which no benchmarks or finished "cures" were very likely to be measurable.

=== Psychology ===
In [[psychology]], the subject of imagination was again explored more extensively since Whitehead, and the question of feasibility or "eternal objects" of thought became central to the impaired [[theory of mind]] explorations that framed postmodern [[cognitive science]]. A biological understanding of the most eternal object, that being the emerging of similar but independent cognitive apparatus, led to an obsession with the process "embodiment", that being, the emergence of these [[cognition]]s. Like Whitehead's God, especially as elaborated in [[J. J. Gibson]]'s [[perceptual psychology]] emphasizing [[affordance]]s, by ordering the relevance of eternal objects (especially the cognitions of other such actors), the world becomes. Or, it becomes simple enough for human beings to begin to make choices, and to prehend what happens as a result. These experiences may be summed in some sense but can only approximately be shared, even among very similar cognitions with identical DNA. An early explorer of this view was [[Alan Turing]] who sought to prove the limits of expressive complexity of human genes in the late 1940s, to put bounds on the complexity of human [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and so assess the feasibility of [[artificial intelligence]] emerging. Since 2000, Process Psychology has progressed as an independent academic and therapeutic discipline: In 2000, [[Michel Weber]] created the Whitehead Psychology Nexus: an open forum dedicated to the cross-examination of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the various facets of the contemporary psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John B., Jr. "Process Psychotherapy: Introduction". ''Process Studies'' vol. 29, no. 1 (Spring–Summer 2000): 97–102; cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stefan Basil Molyneux''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|ə|ˈ|f|æ|n|_|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ᵻ|nj|uː}}; born September 24, 1966) is a Canadian [[podcast]]er and [[List of YouTubers|YouTuber]]. Molyneux, a [[Self-publishing|self-published]] author, usually speaks on the topics of [[anarcho-capitalism]], politics, [[Romance (love)|relationships]], [[race and intelligence]],&amp;nbsp;[[multiculturalism]], [[libertarianism]], [[anti-feminism]],&lt;ref name="Goo"/&gt; and familial relationships.

A supporter of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]], he has been described as [[alt-right]] by ''[[Politico]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] by [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krieg |first=Gregory |date=November 10, 2016 |title=How did Trump win?

== Background ==
Molyneux was born in Ireland and raised mainly in London before moving to Canada at age 11.&lt;ref name=Mississauga-2003 /&gt;  Molyneux attended the [[Glendon College]] of [[York University]], where he was an actor at Theatre Glendon&lt;ref name=Star-23Feb1988 /&gt; and a member of the Debating Society.&lt;ref name=ProTem-8Feb1988 /&gt; He then attended the [[National Theatre School of Canada]] in Montreal.&lt;ref name=Mississauga-2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burg-Star /&gt; In 1991, Molyneux received a B.A. in History from [[McGill University]], where he was active in the [[Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate|McGill Debating Union]]. He then went on to receive an M.A. in History from [[University of Toronto]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=Burg-Star /&gt;&lt;ref name=Globe-2008 /&gt;

== Career ==
In early 1995, Molyneux and his brother Hugh founded Caribou Systems Corporation, a Toronto-based provider of environmental database software. The company was sold in 2000.&lt;ref name="Burg-Star" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2002-01-28_Blue292" /&gt;

In 2005, Molyneux began a podcast called ''Freedomain Radio'' (''FDR'').&lt;ref name="freedomainradio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/0 |title=An Introduction to Freedomain Radio |website=Freedomainradio.com |date= |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the same name for the website on which he distributes his own writings, hosts podcast archives, and provides an [[Internet forum]] for ''FDR'' listeners. Molyneux also produces videos and commentary on current events, and he presents a weekly call-in show on which listeners can ask questions or discuss personal issues.&lt;ref name="Globe-2008" /&gt; Molyneux funds his efforts by soliciting direct payment from listeners and viewers.&lt;ref name="Horsager-TheTrustEdge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Horsager |first=David |date=October 2012 |title=The Trust Edge: How top leaders gain faster results, deeper relationships, and a stronger bottom line |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=New York |pages=25–26 |oclc=820783989 |isbn=978-1-4767-1137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Molyneux interviewed James Damore, the [[Google]] employee who was fired after writing the [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]] memo.&lt;ref name="Goo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Levin |first=Sam |date=August 9, 2017 |title=Fired Google memo writer gives first big interviews to rightwing YouTubers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/09/james-damore-google-memo-youtube-interviews |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Molyneux and Canadian internet personality [[Lauren Southern]] toured the Australian cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Luke |title=What I learnt about the far right from Lauren Southern |url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/what-i-learnt-about-the-far-right-from-lauren-southern/news-story/0443ce7a7a09dc8431776f469b34ae0d |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NITV]] quotes Simon Copland, an SBS freelance writer, who thinks that Molyneux disparaged pre-colonisation [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] culture, calling it "very violent", and downplayed massacres perpetrated against Aborigines, saying that the European takeover of Australia had been less violent than other such takeovers, and that the settlers "were trying to stop infanticide and mass rape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Douglas |title=Far-right Canadian duo's vile rampage against Aboriginal culture at Sydney event |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/07/30/far-right-canadian-duos-vile-rampage-against-aboriginal-culture-sydney-event |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=[[National Indigenous Television]], [[Special Broadcasting Service]] |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molyneux and Southern subsequently traveled to New Zealand for their speaking engagement at [[Auckland]]'s Powerstation theatre.

=== A Voice for Men ===
Molyneux was a panelist at a 2014 Detroit conference held by the [[men's rights movement]] and [[manosphere]] organization, [[A Voice for Men]]. According to Jessica Roy of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Molyneux argued that violence in the world is the result of how women treat their children, and that "If we could just get people to be nice to their babies for five years straight, that would be it for war, drug abuse, addiction, promiscuity, sexually transmitted diseases, ... Almost all would be completely eliminated, because they all arise from dysfunctional early childhood experiences, which are all run by women."&lt;ref name="men"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roy |first=Jessica |date=July 2, 2014 |title=What I Learned as a Woman at a Men's-Rights Conference |url=http://time.com/2949435/what-i-learned-as-a-woman-at-a-mens-rights-conference/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alt-right ===
Molyneux has been described as a part of the "[[alt-right]]" by ''Politico'', ''Metro'', ''NY Magazine,'' ''Vanity Fair,'' and ''CBS,'' and has been described as "one of the alt-right's biggest YouTube stars" by ''Washington Post'' columnist J.

=== Family of origin (FOO) relationships ===
Molyneux refers to the family that people are born into as their "family of origin" or "FOO". Molyneux suggests that family of origin relationships may not necessarily be desirable, and in some circumstances may even be detrimental, and thus, for those individuals having suffered abusive childhood relationships, it would be advantageous for them to sever such involuntary relationships as adults, or "deFOO".&lt;ref name=Guardian-2008&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/15/family-relationships-fdr-defoo-cult |title=You will never see me again |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |first=Kate |last=Hilpern |date=November 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, he views all adult relationships as being voluntary and discretionary rather than obligatory. According to a 2008 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', both Molyneux and his wife have "deFOOed".&lt;ref name=Guardian-2008 /&gt;

=== Stateless society ===
Molyneux theorizes that the pursuit of virtue in our personal lives could bring about a [[stateless society]] that abhors the initiation of force (see [[non-aggression principle]]). In addition, the free market (see [[anarcho-capitalism]]), [[polycentric law|polycentric legal system]]s and private "dispute resolution organizations" (DROs) could be empowered to find new and more peaceful ways of adjudicating [[common law]] infractions and contractual disputes.&lt;ref name=molyneux-DRO&gt;{{cite web|last=Molyneux|first=Stefan|title=The Stateless Society An Examination of Alternatives|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/10/stefan-molyneux/the-stateless-society-an-examination-of-alternatives/|publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]]|date=October 24, 2005|accessdate= May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, libertarian philosopher [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] gave a critical examination of Molyneux's 2007 ''Universally Preferable Behaviour: A Rational Proof for Secular Ethics'' in ''The Mises Review'', stating, "He fails, and fails miserably. His arguments are often preposterously bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/daily/6101/The-Molyneux-Problem |title=The Molyneux Problem &amp;#124; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordon would reply again to Molyneux's own response to the criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/mr-molyneux-responds |title=Mr. Molyneux Responds; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White genocide ===
Molyneux believes in the [[White genocide conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/362284/alt-right-speakers-stefan-molyneux-and-lauren-southern-anger-nz-muslims |title=Alt-right speakers Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern anger NZ Muslims |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 interview with [[Lauren Southern]] about [[South African farm attacks|violence against white farmers in South Africa]], he stated that the media and [[NGOs]] were under-reporting the subject because they "don’t want to scare the whites in the west with what happens when whites become a minority in a highly aggressive and tribalised world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=White Farmers Slaughtered in South Africa {{!}} Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TfAq3LrIjg&amp;t=1288 |first=Stefan |last= Molyneux |date= February 10, 2018 |publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/jul/16/news-corps-promotion-of-lauren-southern-is-disturbing |title=News Corp Australia’s promotion of Lauren Southern is disturbing |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After portrait painter [[Kehinde Wiley]] was chosen to paint [[Barack Obama]]'s [[President Barack Obama (painting)|presidential portrait]], Molyneux called Wiley a "white genocide [[fetish artist]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/07/free-speech-group-says-dangerous-precedent-will-be-set-if-they-lose-lawsuit.html |title=Free-speech group says 'dangerous precedent' will be set if they lose lawsuit |publisher=''[[Newshub]]'' |date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that in 2012 Wiley had created two paintings of black women holding up the severed heads of white women, which Wiley later referred to as "sort of a play on the 'kill [[whitey (slang)|whitey]]' thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President Obama's Anti-White Racism Portrait Scandal |url=https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=98d_1518555494 |first=Stefan |last=Molyneux |date= February 13, 2018 |publisher=LiveLeak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kehinde Wiley's Obama portrait controversy proves Americans struggle to engage with art |url= https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/kehinde-wiley-s-obama-portrait-controversy-shows-americans-don-t-ncna849156 |first=Seph |last= Rodney |date= Feb 18, 2018 |publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult accusations==

According to [[Steven Hassan]], a mental health counselor with experience on cults, "Partly what's going on with the people on the Internet who are indoctrinated, they spend lots of hours on the computer. Videos can have them up all night for several nights in a row. Molyneux knows how to talk like he knows what he's talking about, despite very little academic research. He cites this and cites that, and presents it as the whole truth. It dismantles people's sense of self and replaces it with his sense of confidence about how to fix the world."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Collins, Ben (February 5, 2016). [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/05/meet-the-cult-leader-stumping-for-donald-trump.html Meet the 'Cult' Leader Stumping for Donald Trump.] ''The Daily Beast.'' Retrieved: October 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Tu Thanh Ha wrote that Molyneux was called the leader of a "therapy cult" following ''Freedomain Radio (FDR)'' community member Tom Bell breaking off all contact with his family.&lt;ref name="Globe-2008" /&gt; In April 2008, Bell had called in to the show asking about his [[veganism]] and his feeling of disgust towards people that eat meat.&lt;ref name="Times-2009"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whipple |first=Tom |date=January 10, 2009 |title=The mother and son torn apart by web 'cult' that destroys families |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-mother-and-son-torn-apart-by-web-cult-that-destroys-families-w8klkzndf50 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate= August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molyneux suggested that this disgust could have come from witnessing an authority figure who was cruel to animals.&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt; Bell responded by describing memories of his father being verbally and physically cruel to the family cat, causing him to feel intimidated by the father, and then described his [[emotional detachment]] toward his mother and the rest of his family.&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt;

The following month, Bell left a note stating he no longer wanted contact and left home. It was reported that, of the estimated 50,000 users of the website, about 20 (0.04%) ''FDR'' members had also "deFOOed" (disassociate from family of origin), and that many parents chose not to speak to the media in an effort to avoid alienating their children further.&lt;ref name=Times-2009 /&gt; A representative of the British [[Cult Information Centre]] said they were following ''FDR'', and noted that one sign of cults was that they cut people off from their families. Molyneux responded by saying, "If I advised a wife to leave an abusive husband, there would not be articles about how I am a cult leader."&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt;

Molyneux and FOO were subjects of an investigative documentary by [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which aired on August 20, 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.channel5.com/shows/trapped-in-a-cult |title=Trapped In A Cult? |publisher=Channel 5 |date=2015-08-20 |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Daisy |date=August 20, 2015 |title= Trapped in a Cult? – TV review: Disappointing Channel 5 shock-doc fails to come up to scratch |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/trapped-in-a-cult-tv-review-disappointing-channel-5-shock-doc-fails-to-come-up-to-scratch-10464473.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date= November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molyneux and "deFOOing" were one of three subjects featured on the February 18, 2016 episode of the documentary series ''[[Dark Net (TV series)|Dark Net]]''. The episode calls ''Freedomain Radio'' a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sho.com/dark-net/season/1/episode/5/trapped |title=Dark Net – Season 1, Episode 5 |website= Showtime |accessdate= 12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1158">'''Wagnerism'''  has a number of meanings:

* the [[philosophy|philosophical]] ideals put forward by [[Richard Wagner]] which indicate  the traits of a "true" [[Germany|German]], among other [[aestheticism|aesthetic]] ideas.
* an attachment, sometimes fanatical, to the music of Wagner.
* a form of adversarial [[labour union]] legislation, the [[Wagner Act]] in the [[United States]], and similarly adopted in [[Canada]], among other countries.

The first two of these aspects were promoted, often in distorted form, by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany. [[Adolf Hitler]] argued that "Germany would be impossible without Wagner and all he represents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=manuscripts |title=Hitler and Wagnerism |author=Janet Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Hansen, Chad. (1983). (see above). There are no articles in Chinese, so the nouns must be read as collectives, mass nouns or plurals. The argument is about the use of terms hence belongs to the school of names. It is not about the color of horses.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13196">'''When A White Horse Is Not A Horse''' ({{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|w=''Pai-ma fei ma''|l=white horse not horse}}), also known as the '''White Horse Dialogue''' ({{zh|c=白馬論|p=''Báimǎ Lùn''|w=''Pai-ma Lun''|l=white horse discourse}}), is a famous paradox in [[Chinese philosophy]]. [[Gongsun Long]] wrote this circa 300 BC dialectic analysis of the question 'Is "white horse not horse" permissibly assertible?'.

==The original text==
[[File:Cabalo044eue.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Is it a horse?]]
The White Horse Dialogue (''Baima Lun'') constitutes chapter 2 of the [[eponymous]] ''Gongsun Longzi'' "Master Gongsun Long", who was counted among the "[[School of Names]]" (aka "Logicians" or "Dialecticians") in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost and the received ''Gongsun Longzi'' text only contains 6 of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated and some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialogue is between two unnamed speakers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is "{{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|l=white horse not horse}}" assertible?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: It is.&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: How?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: "Horse" is that by means of which one names the shape. "White" is that by means of which one names the color. What names the color is not what names the shape. Hence, one may "white horse not horse."&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: If there are white horses, one cannot say that there are no horses. If one cannot say that there are no horses, doesn't that mean that there are horses? For there to be white horses is for there to be horses. How could it be that the white ones are not horses?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: If one wants horses, that extends to yellow or black horses. But if one wants white horses, that does not extend to a yellow or black horses. Suppose that white horses were horses. Then what one wants [in the two cases] would be the same. If what one wants were the same, then 'white' would not differ from 'horse.' If what one wants does not differ, then how is it that yellow or black horses are acceptable in one case and unacceptable in the other case? It is clear that acceptable and unacceptable are mutually contrary. Hence, yellow and black horses are the same, one can respond that there are horses, but one cannot respond that there are white horses. Thus, it is evident that white horses are not horses.&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;[[Gongsun Long]]zi. (2005). {{Google books|5PL9hSUiVEoC|''Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy,'' pp. 364–365|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This dialogue continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether "white" and "horse" can be separated from "white horse".

Other ''Gongsun longzi'' chapters discuss ''Baima''-related concepts of ''jian'' [[Wikt:堅|堅]] "hard; hardness" and ''bai'' [[Wikt:白|白]] "white; whiteness", ''ming'' [[Wikt:名|名]] "name; term" and ''shi'' [[Wikt:實|實]] "solid; true, actual; fact, reality", and abstract ''zhi'' [[Wikt:指|指]] "finger; pointing; designation; [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]" like "whiteness" and concrete ''wu'' [[Wikt:物|物]] "thing; object; [[particular]]" like a "white horse".

==Difficulties of interpretation==
The Chinese of "a white horse is not a horse" is ''bai ma fei ma'' 白馬非馬, whose meaning hinges upon the [[Negation (rhetoric)|negative]] ''fei'' [[Wikt:非|非]] "not, is not; no, negative; oppose; wrong". The Classical construction "A ''fei'' B" "A非B" can ambiguously mean either "A is not a member of the class B" or "A is not identical to B".&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this [[equivocation]] fallacy, [[A.C. Graham]] says this "white horse" vs. "horse" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether "is" means:
# "Is a member of the [[Class (philosophy)|class]] (x)"
# "Is identical to  (x)"&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"/&gt;

In other words, the expression "a white horse is not a horse" is ambiguous between "a white horse is not identical with a horse" (true, because "white horse" is more specific than "horse"), and "a white horse is not a member of the set of horses" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting that "a white horse is not [identical with] a horse," while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as "a white horse is not [a member of the group of] horses."

An illustration of the alternative uses of "fei" may be found in the widely known "Happiness of Fish" dialogue in ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (17, tr. Watson 1968:188-9). Huizi says "You're not a fish [子非魚] &amp;mdash; how do you know what fish enjoy?" (denying that Zhuangzi is a member of the class of fish) and Zhuangzi replies "You're not I [子非我], so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?" (denying that the individuals Huizi and Zhuangzi are identical).

Beyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of ''Baima fei ma'', the first line obscurely asks ''ke hu'' [[Wikt:可|可]][[Wikt:乎|乎]] "Can it be that …?". This dialogue could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. [[Bryan W. Van Norden]] suggests that "the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' ''could'' be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse ''is'' a horse.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Norden|first1=Bryan|title=Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|date=2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|location=Indianapolis|isbn=9781603844680|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation is offered in [[Feng Youlan]]'s ''History of Chinese Philosophy ''(translated in 1952 by [[Derk Bodde]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strictly speaking, names or terms are divided into those that are abstract and those that are concrete. The abstract term denotes the universal, the concrete term the particular. The particular is the denotation, and the universal the connotation, of the term. In western inflected languages there is no difficulty in distinguishing between the particular ('white' or 'horse') and the abstract ('whiteness' or 'horseness'). In Chinese, however, owing to the fact that the written characters are ideographic and pictorial and lack all inflection, there is no possible way, as far as the form of individual words is concerned, of distinguishing between abstract and concrete terms. Thus in Chinese the word designating a particular horse and that designating the universal, 'horseness,' are written and pronounced in the same way. Similarly with other terms, so that such words as 'horse' and 'white', being used to designate both the concrete particular and the abstract universal, thus hold two values.&lt;ref&gt;Fung Yu-lan. (1953). ''A History of Chinese Philosophy,'' p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are no contemporary histories of Chinese philosophy that subscribe to [[Feng Youlan]]'s interpretation. Other philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialogue include Graham,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1989). ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China,'' pp.75-95;  Graham, (1990). {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies,'' pp. 125–216.|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad. 1976. "Mass Nouns and 'A White Horse Is Not a Horse'", ''[[Philosophy East and West]],'' 26.2:189-209; Hansen, Chad. (1983). ''Language and Logic in Ancient China,'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Harbsmeier,&lt;ref&gt;Harbsmeier, Christoph. (1998). "Language and Logic in Traditional China". Volume 7, Part I of ''Science and Civilisation in China,'' pp. 298–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Kirill Ole. 1995. "When a 'White Horse' Is Not a 'Horse'", ''Philosophy East and West'' 45.4:481-499.&lt;/ref&gt; and Van Norden.&lt;ref name="readings"/&gt;

==Historic influence==
In the Chinese philosophical tradition, the ''Baima Lun'''s significance is evident from how many [[Chinese classic texts]] directly or indirectly discuss it. The ''[[Liezi]]'', which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as "perversions of reason and sense", explains "'A white horse is not a horse', because the name diverges from the shape."&lt;ref name="Graham-studies80"&gt;Graham, {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|p. 80.|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his ''zhi'' 指 "attribute" and ''ma'' 馬 "horse" notions in the same context.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuangzi. (2003). {{Google books|IKLsWSbCAWQC|''Zhuangzi: basic writings,'' p. 35.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Mengzi'' (6A4) notes that ''bai'' 白 "white" has different connotations whether we are using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness? The fact of a man's being old? Or the fact of our giving honour to his age?'&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James. (1895). {{Google books|4L0TAAAAYAAJ|''The Chinese Classics: a Translation;'' Part 2, ''The Works of Mencius,'' p. 398.|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other early "A white horse is not a horse" references are found in the ''[[Hanfeizi]]'' (32), ''[[Mozi]]'' (11B), and ''[[Zhanguoce]]'' (4).

'''Zeno's paradoxes''' are a set of [[philosophy|philosophical]] problems generally thought to have been devised by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] (c. 490–430 BC) to support [[Parmenides]]' doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief in [[Ontological pluralism|plurality]] and change is mistaken, and in particular that [[motion (physics)|motion]] is nothing but an [[illusion]].  It is usually assumed, based on [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']] (128a–d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these [[paradox]]es because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view.  Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes "is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one."&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128d&lt;/ref&gt; Plato has [[Socrates]] claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point.&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128a–b&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Zeno's nine surviving paradoxes (preserved in [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'']]&lt;ref name=aristotle&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html Aristotle's ''Physics''] "Physics" by Aristotle translated by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye

&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius's]] commentary thereon) are essentially equivalent to one another. Aristotle offered a refutation of some of them.&lt;ref name=aristotle/&gt;  Three of the strongest and most famous—that of Achilles and the tortoise, the [[Dichotomy]] argument, and that of an arrow in flight—are presented in detail below.

Zeno's arguments are perhaps the first examples of a method of proof called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' also known as [[proof by contradiction]].  They are also credited as a source of the [[dialectic]] method used by Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;([fragment 65], Diogenes Laertius. [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlzeno-eleatic.htm IX] 25ff and VIII 57).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mathematicians and historians, such as [[Carl Boyer]], hold that Zeno's paradoxes are simply mathematical problems, for which modern [[calculus]] provides a mathematical solution.&lt;ref name=boyer&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Carl |title=The History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w3xKLt_da2UC&amp;dq=zeno+calculus&amp;q=zeno#v=snippet&amp;q=zeno |year=1959 |publisher=Dover Publications  |accessdate=2010-02-26 |page=295 | quote=If the paradoxes are thus stated in the precise mathematical terminology of continuous variables (...) the seeming contradictions resolve themselves. |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[philosopher]]s, however, say that Zeno's paradoxes and their variations (see [[Thomson's lamp]]) remain relevant [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] problems.&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft&gt;{{cite web |first=Francis |last=Moorcroft |title=Zeno's Paradox |url=http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418141459/http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archivedate=2010-04-18 }}

The origins of the paradoxes are somewhat unclear. [[Diogenes Laertius]], a fourth source for information about Zeno and his teachings, citing [[Favorinus]], says that Zeno's teacher Parmenides was the first to introduce the Achilles and the tortoise paradox. But in a later passage, Laertius attributes the origin of the paradox to Zeno, explaining that Favorinus disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', 9.23 and 9.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paradoxes of motion ==

=== Achilles and the tortoise ===
{{Redirect|Achilles and the Tortoise}}
[[File:Race between Achilles and the tortoise.gif|thumb|Distance vs. time, assuming the tortoise to run at Achilles' half speed]]
[[File:Zeno Achilles Paradox.png|thumb|left|Achilles and the tortoise]]

| In a race, the quickest runner can never overtake the slowest, since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead.| as recounted by [[Aristotle]], [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] VI:9, 239b15
}}
In the paradox of [[Achilles]] and the [[tortoise]], Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] of 100 meters, for example. Supposing that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite [[time]], Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Dichotomy paradox ===

Suppose Homer wishes to walk to the end of a path. Before he can get there, he must get halfway there. Before he can get halfway there, he must get a quarter of the way there. Before traveling a quarter, he must travel one-eighth; before an eighth, one-sixteenth; and so on.

The resulting sequence can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt; \left\{ \cdots,  \frac{1}{16},  \frac{1}{8},  \frac{1}{4},  \frac{1}{2},  1 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

This description requires one to complete an infinite number of tasks, which Zeno maintains is an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48205-7|page=33|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sequence also presents a second problem in that it contains no first distance to run, for any possible ([[wikt:finite|finite]]) first distance could be divided in half, and hence would not be first after all. Hence, the trip cannot even begin. The paradoxical conclusion then would be that travel over any finite distance can neither be completed nor begun, and so all motion must be an [[illusion]]. An alternative conclusion, [[Duration (philosophy)#Responses to Kant and Zeno|proposed]] by [[Henri Bergson]], is that motion (time and distance) is not actually divisible.

This argument is called the ''[[Dichotomy]]'' because it involves repeatedly splitting a distance into two parts. It contains some of the same elements as the ''Achilles and the Tortoise'' paradox, but with a more apparent conclusion of motionlessness. It is also known as the '''Race Course''' paradox. Some, like Aristotle, regard the Dichotomy as really just another version of ''Achilles and the Tortoise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Dic |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.1 The Dichotomy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrow paradox ===
[[File:Zeno Arrow Paradox.png|thumb|The arrow]]

{{quote|If everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html#752 |work=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics |author=Aristotle |quote=Zeno's reasoning, however, is fallacious, when he says that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. This is false, for time is not composed of indivisible moments any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|as recounted by [[Aristotle]], [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] VI:9, 239b5}}

In the arrow paradox (also known as the '''[[fletching|fletcher's]] paradox'''), Zeno states that for motion to occur, an object must change the position which it occupies. He gives an example of an arrow in flight. He states that in any one (duration-less) instant of time, the arrow is neither moving to where it is, nor to where it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | chapter-url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_IX#Pyrrho | first=Diogenes |last=Laertius |authorlink=Diogenes Laërtius | title=[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]] | volume=IX |chapter=Pyrrho  |at= passage 72 | year=c. 230| isbn=1-116-71900-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It cannot move to where it is not, because no time elapses for it to move there; it cannot move to where it is, because it is already there. In other words, at every instant of time there is no motion occurring.  If everything is motionless at every instant, and time is entirely composed of instants, then motion is impossible.

Whereas the first two paradoxes divide space, this paradox starts by dividing time—and not into segments, but into points.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Arr |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.3 The Arrow |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three other paradoxes as given by Aristotle ==

=== Paradox of Place ===
From Aristotle:
{{quote
|If everything that exists has a place, place too will have a place, and so on ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.4.iv.html ''Physics'' IV:1, 209a25]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Paradox of the Grain of Millet ===
Description of the paradox from the ''Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy'':
{{quote
|The argument is that a single grain of [[millet]] makes no sound upon falling, but a thousand grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something, an absurd conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Michael Proudfoot, A.R. Lace. Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy. Routledge 2009, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle's refutation:
{{quote
|Zeno is wrong in saying that there is no part of the millet that does not make a sound: for there is no reason why any such part should not in any length of time fail to move the air that the whole bushel moves in falling. In fact it does not of itself move even such a quantity of the air as it would move if this part were by itself: for no part even exists otherwise than potentially.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.7.vii.html ''Physics'' VII:5, 250a20]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Description from Nick Huggett:
{{quote
|This is a [[Parmenides|Parmenidean]] argument that one cannot trust one's sense of hearing. Aristotle's response seems to be that even inaudible sounds can add to an audible sound.&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, Nick, "Zeno's Paradoxes", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#GraMil&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The Moving Rows (or Stadium) ===
[[File:Zeno Moving Rows Paradox.png|thumb|The moving rows]]From Aristotle:
{{quote
|... concerning the two rows of bodies, each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing each other on a race-course as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite directions, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal and the middle point of the course and the other that between the middle point and the starting-post. This...involves the conclusion that half a given time is equal to double that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html ''Physics'' VI:9, 239b33]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For an expanded account of Zeno's arguments as presented by Aristotle, see [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius']] commentary ''On Aristotle's Physics''.

== Proposed solutions ==

=== Diogenes the Cynic ===
According to [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], [[Diogenes the Cynic]] said nothing upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but stood up and walked, in order to demonstrate the falsity of Zeno's conclusions (see ''[[solvitur ambulando]]''). To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what is wrong with the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] (384 BC−322 BC) remarked that as the distance decreases, the time needed to cover those distances also decreases, so that the time needed also becomes increasingly small.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Aristotle's observation that the fractional times also get shorter does not guarantee, in every case, that the task can be completed. One case in which it does not hold is that in which the fractional times decrease in a [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], while the distances decrease geometrically, such as: 1/2 s for 1/2 m gain, 1/3 s for next 1/4 m gain, 1/4 s for next 1/8 m gain, 1/5 s for next 1/16 m gain, 1/6 s for next 1/32 m gain, etc. In this case, the distances form a convergent series, but the times form a [[divergent series]], the sum of which has no limit. Archimedes developed a more explicitly mathematical approach than Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle also distinguished "things infinite in respect of divisibility" (such as a unit of space that can be mentally divided into ever smaller units while remaining spatially the same) from things (or distances) that are infinite in extension ("with respect to their extremities").&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9; 6.2, 233a21-31&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle's objection to the arrow paradox was that "Time is not composed of indivisible nows any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html |title=Physics |volume=VI |at=Part 9 verse: 239b5 |isbn=0-585-09205-2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;!-- please do not change to Saint Thomas Aquinas, see [[MOS:SAINTS]] --&gt; commenting on Aristotle's objection, wrote "Instants are not parts of time, for time is not made up of instants any more than a magnitude is made of points, as we have already proved. Hence it does not follow that a thing is not in motion in a given time, just because it is not in motion in any instant of that time."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. Commentary on Aristotle's Physics, Book 6.861
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archimedes ===
Before 212 BC, [[Archimedes]] had developed a method to derive a finite answer for the sum of infinitely many terms that get progressively smaller. (See: [[Geometric series]], [[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·]], ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''.) Modern calculus achieves the same result, using more rigorous methods (see [[convergent series]], where the "reciprocals of powers of 2" series, equivalent to the Dichotomy Paradox, is listed as convergent). These methods allow the construction of solutions based on the conditions stipulated by Zeno, i.e. the amount of time taken at each step is geometrically decreasing.&lt;ref name=boyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George B. Thomas, ''Calculus and Analytic Geometry'', Addison Wesley, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bertrand Russell ===
[[Bertrand Russell]] offered what is known as the "at-at theory of motion". It agrees that there can be no motion "during" a durationless instant, and contends that all that is required for motion is that the arrow be at one point at one time, at another point another time, and at appropriate points between those two points for intervening times. In this view motion is a function of position with respect to time.&lt;ref name=HuggettBook&gt;{{ cite book |title=Space From Zeno to Einstein |first=Nick |last=Huggett |year=1999 |isbn=0-262-08271-3 }}

Nick Huggett argues that Zeno is [[begging the question|assuming the conclusion]] when he says that objects that occupy the same space as they do at rest must be at rest.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow/&gt;

=== Peter Lynds ===
Peter Lynds has argued that all of Zeno's motion paradoxes are resolved by the conclusion that instants in time and instantaneous magnitudes do not physically exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1197/|title=Zeno's Paradoxes: A Timely Solution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Lynds argues that an object in relative motion cannot have an instantaneous or determined relative position (for if it did, it could not be in motion), and so cannot have its motion fractionally dissected as if it does, as is assumed by the paradoxes. For more about the inability to know both speed and location, see [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

=== Hermann Weyl ===
Another proposed solution is to question one of the assumptions Zeno used in his paradoxes (particularly the Dichotomy), which is that between any two different points in space (or time), there is always another point. Without this assumption there are only a finite number of distances between two points, hence there is no infinite sequence of movements, and the paradox is resolved. The ideas of [[Planck length]] and [[Planck time]] in modern physics place a limit on the measurement of time and space, if not on time and space themselves. According to [[Hermann Weyl]], the assumption that space is made of finite and discrete units is subject to a further problem, given by the "[[Weyl's tile argument|tile argument]]" or "distance function problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Bendegem|first=Jean Paul|title=Finitism in Geometry|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/geometry-finitism/#SomParSolProDea|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2012-01-03|date=17 March 2010 }}

According to this, the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle in discretized space is always equal to the length of one of the two sides, in contradiction to geometry. [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]] has argued that the Tile Argument can be resolved, and that discretization can therefore remove the paradox.&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=187807 |title=Discussion:Zeno's Paradoxes and the Tile Argument |first=Jean Paul |last=van Bendegem |location= Belgium |year=1987 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=295–302|doi=10.1086/289379}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== The paradoxes in modern times ==
Infinite processes remained theoretically troublesome in mathematics until the late 19th century. The [[Ε-δ definition|epsilon-delta]] version of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] developed a rigorous formulation of the logic and calculus involved. These works resolved the mathematics involving infinite processes.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Harold | title=Are Zeno's Paradoxes Based on a Mistake? |jstor=2251675 |year=1965 |journal= [[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |volume=74 |issue=296 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages= 563–570 |doi=10.1093/mind/LXXIV.296.563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=russell&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|B Russell]] (1956) ''Mathematics and the metaphysicians'' in "The World of Mathematics" (ed.

While mathematics can calculate where and when the moving Achilles will overtake the Tortoise of Zeno's paradox, philosophers such as Brown and Moorcroft&lt;ref name=KBrown&gt;{{cite web

claim that mathematics does not address the central point in Zeno's argument, and that solving the mathematical issues does not solve every issue the paradoxes raise.

Popular literature often misrepresents Zeno's arguments. For example, Zeno is often said to have argued that the sum of an infinite number of terms must itself be infinite–with the result that not only the time, but also the distance to be travelled, become infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Benson|first= Donald C.|title= The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies|year= 1999|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0195117219|page= 14|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8_vbuzxrpfIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A humorous take is offered by [[Tom Stoppard]] in his play Jumpers (1972), in which the principal protagonist, the philosophy professor George Moore, suggests that according to Zeno’s paradox, [[Saint Sebastian]], a 3rd Century Christian saint supposedly martyred by being shot with arrows, died of fright.  However, none of the original ancient sources has Zeno discussing the sum of any infinite series. Simplicius has Zeno saying "it is impossible to traverse an infinite number of things in a finite time". This presents Zeno's problem not with finding the ''sum'', but rather with ''finishing'' a task with an infinite number of steps: how can one ever get from A to B, if an infinite number of (non-instantaneous) events can be identified that need to precede the arrival at B, and one cannot reach even the beginning of a "last event"?&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Papa-G /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#ZenInf |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 5. Zeno's Influence on Philosophy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate continues on the question of whether or not Zeno's paradoxes have been resolved. In ''The History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (2010) Burton writes, "Although Zeno's argument confounded his contemporaries, a satisfactory explanation incorporates a now-familiar idea, the notion of a 'convergent infinite series.'".&lt;ref&gt;Burton, David, ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', McGraw Hill, 2010, {{isbn|978-0-07-338315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offered a "solution" to the paradoxes based on the work of [[Georg Cantor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |date=2002 |title=Our Knowledge of the External World: As a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy |chapter=Lecture 6. The Problem of Infinity Considered Historically |publisher=Routledge |page=169 |orig-year=First published in 1914 by The Open Court Publishing Company |isbn=0-415-09605-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Brown concludes "Given the history of 'final resolutions', from Aristotle onwards, it's probably foolhardy to think we've reached the end. It may be that Zeno's arguments on motion, because of their simplicity and universality, will always serve as a kind of [[Rorschach test|'Rorschach image']] onto which people can project their most fundamental phenomenological concerns (if they have any)."&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;

==A similar ancient Chinese philosophic consideration==
[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient Han Chinese]] philosophers from the [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] during the [[Warring States period|Warring States period of China (479-221 BCE)]] independently developed equivalents to some of Zeno's paradoxes. The scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]], in his ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', describes an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] paradox from the surviving [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] book of logic which states, in the [[archaism|archaic]] [[Old Chinese|ancient Chinese script]], "a one-foot stick, every day take away half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted." Several other paradoxes from this philosophical school (more precisely, movement) are known, but their modern interpretation is more speculative.

== Quantum Zeno effect ==
{{Main article|Quantum Zeno effect}}

In 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |bibcode=1977JMP....18..756M |last=Sudarshan |first=E. C. G. |authorlink=E. C. G.

&lt;/ref&gt; physicists [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and B. Misra discovered that the dynamical evolution (motion) of a quantum system can be hindered (or even inhibited) through observation of the system.&lt;ref name="u0"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/858.pdf |format=PDF |author1=W.M.Itano |author2=D.J.

&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is usually called the "quantum Zeno effect" as it is strongly reminiscent of Zeno's arrow paradox. This effect was first theorized in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |last=Khalfin |first=L.A. |author-link=   |journal=Soviet Phys.

== Zeno behaviour ==
In the field of verification and design of [[timed event system|timed]] and [[hybrid system]]s, the system behaviour is called ''Zeno'' if it includes an infinite number of discrete steps in a finite amount of time.&lt;ref name="Fishwick2007"&gt;{{cite book | editor=Paul A.  Fishwick | title=Handbook of dynamic system modeling | url=https://books.google.com/?id=cM-eFv1m3BoC&amp;pg=SA15-PA22 | accessdate=2010-03-05 | edition=hardcover | series=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Computer and Information Science | date=1 June 2007 | publisher=CRC Press | location=Boca Raton, Florida, USA | isbn=978-1-58488-565-8 | pages=15–22 to 15–23 | chapter=15.6 "Pathological Behavior Classes" in chapter 15  "Hybrid Dynamic Systems: Modeling and Execution" by Pieter J.  Mosterman, The Mathworks, Inc. }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[formal verification]] techniques exclude these behaviours from analysis, if they are not equivalent to non-Zeno behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lamport |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Lamport |year=2002 |title=Specifying Systems |format=PDF |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-14306-X |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book-02-08-08.pdf |page=128 |accessdate=2010-03-06 }}

In [[systems design]] these behaviours will also often be excluded from system models, since they cannot be implemented with a digital controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Henzinger |first2=Thomas |last1=Franck |first1=Cassez |first3=Jean-Francois |last3=Raskin |url=http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |title=A Comparison of Control Problems for Timed and Hybrid Systems |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528193234/http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
