The '''Amethyst Initiative''' is an organization made up of [[Higher education in the United States|U.S. college]] presidents and chancellors that in July 2008 launched a movement calling for the reconsideration of U.S. [[legal drinking age]], particularly the minimum age of 21. The [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984]]  requires all US states to raise their minimum age for purchase and public possession of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to 21 or face a reduction in highway funds under the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act]]. The Amethyst Initiative was initiated by [[John McCardell]], founder of [[Choose Responsibility]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chooseresponsibility.org/cr-news/cr-announces-amethyst-initiative |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203175131/http://blog.chooseresponsibility.org/cr-news/cr-announces-amethyst-initiative/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-03 |title=Choose Responsibility announces Amethyst Initiative |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a former professor of history at [[Middlebury College]] in [[Middlebury, Vermont]] and current Vice-Chancellor of [[Sewanee: The University of the South]], and is currently supported by 136&lt;ref name="theamethystinitiative.org"&gt;http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement/&lt;/ref&gt; college presidents who signed a statement proclaiming, "It’s time to rethink the drinking age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamethystinitiative.org |title=Amethyst Initiative front page|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828030259/http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/| archivedate= 28 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[[The Associated Press]] {{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jWXhmLxHPcv8q_iFiN7nLt7RP8CgD92L2IIO0 |title=College presidents seek debate on drinking age |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821225406/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jWXhmLxHPcv8q_iFiN7nLt7RP8CgD92L2IIO0 |archivedate=21 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] legend, [[amethyst]]s protected their owners from [[drunkenness]].

==Purpose==
The Amethyst Initiative states that, in their experience as university presidents, they have observed, "Alcohol education that mandates [[abstinence]] as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students," and therefore they urge lawmakers "to invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare [[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]]s to make responsible decisions about alcohol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement |title=Amethyst Initiative » Statement|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080902032504/http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement| archivedate= 2 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustavus Adolphus College]] President Jack R. Ohle said in a statement that the initiative is not about lowering the drinking age, but to open a debate on alcohol policies that affect young people and their choices about alcohol use. {{quotation|We need serious, sustained, unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how these two things are aligned. I signed the statement in hopes that it would encourage debate on our campus about the seriousness of drinking in general but more importantly the high-risk drinking that has become so common on college campuses today. As an educator, I feel a responsibility to encourage a discussion about responsibility. That responsibility rests with not only the students but with those of us who work to provide for their education, safety, and well being. We must engage in civil, informed, and dispassionate debate and consider all policy alternatives no matter how controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gustavus.edu/news/4168 |title=Statement from President Ohle Regarding Amethyst Initiative | publisher =  Gustavus Adolphus College |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Statement ==
The Amethyst Initiative states the following:&lt;ref name="theamethystinitiative.org"/&gt;

{{blockquote|'''It’s time to rethink the drinking age'''
In 1984 Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which imposed a penalty of 10% of a state's federal highway appropriation on any state setting its drinking age lower than 21.

Twenty-four years later, our experience as college and university presidents convinces us that…

'''Twenty-one is not working'''

A culture of dangerous, clandestine “binge-drinking”—often conducted off-campus—has developed.

Alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students.

Adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting, signing contracts, serving on juries and enlisting in the military, but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer.

By choosing to use fake IDs, students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law.

'''How many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition?'''

We call upon our elected officials:

To support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21-year-old drinking age.

To consider whether the 10% highway fund “incentive” encourages or inhibits that debate.

To invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol.

We pledge ourselves and our institutions to playing a vigorous, constructive role as these critical discussions unfold.}}

==Public reaction==
The initiative's proposal has been criticized by several groups and government and industry officials, including [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD). Joining MADD's criticism are other groups, including the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], the [[American Medical Association]], and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]].&lt;ref name="MADD PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-19-2008/0004869764&amp;EDATE= |title=MADD press release: Some University Presidents Shirk Responsibility to Protect Students from Dangers of Underage Drinking |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823001726/http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F08-19-2008%2F0004869764&amp;EDATE= |archivedate=23 August 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A spokesman for the [[Governors Highway Safety Association]] told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that university leaders "are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/20/AR2008082003626.html?sub=new "Lower drinking age is criticized"] (free registration required), ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, Amethyst Initiative's parent organization, Choose Responsibility, proposes that only [[high school graduate]]s should be eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/proposal |title=Choose Responsibility: drinking age proposals|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release, MADD argues that lowering the drinking age would result in greater numbers of fatal automobile accidents, and that the presidents are "looking for an easy way out of an inconvenient problem" and "misrepresenting science."&lt;ref name="MADD PR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madd.org/Article-Archive/2008/August/Article---Amethyst-Initiative-Underage-Drinking-Re.aspx |title=Mothers Against Drunk Driving - Amethyst Initiative Underage Drinking Response |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107101240/http://www.madd.org/Article-Archive/2008/August/Article---Amethyst-Initiative-Underage-Drinking-Re.aspx |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MADD cited former [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] Secretary, and current [[University of Miami]] president [[Donna Shalala]] statement that "maintaining the legal drinking age at 21 is a socially and medically sound policy that helps parents, schools and law enforcement protect our youth from the potentially life-threatening effects of underage drinking."&lt;ref name="MADD PR"/&gt;
 
[[Choose Responsibility]] argues that scientific evidence supports the Amethyst Initiative's views and goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17294/1/2638 |title=Legal Age 21 - National Minimum Drinking Age - FAQ with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17305/1/2643 |title=Drinking and Culture: International Comparisons with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17312/1/2648 |title=Drunken Driving Fatalities with citations|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refutes some of MADD's past claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/myths_realities_c/ |title=Myths and Realities about drinking with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/19785/1/2635/ |title=Not Convinced? |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanford Ungar, president of Goucher College and signee of the initiative argues that opponents should not fear because the Amethyst Initiative is about opening up the debate to improve alcohol policy. He brings about the misconception that they want to "polarize" the issue at hand, but instead wishes to find a better alternative to the current drinking age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-span.org/video/?280945-7/changing-drinking-age-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Radley Balko, of ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]],'' wryly noted inconsistency opponents of the Amethyst Initiative believe that it "would be a "national tragedy" to, for example, allow 19- and 20-year-old men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to have a beer in celebration of completing their tours of duty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Balko | first =Radley  | title =Amethyst Initiative's Debate on Drinking a Welcome Alternative to Fanaticism | newspaper =[[Fox News]] | date =August 25, 2008| url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,410283,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Balko also noted research showing that underage drinking laws had not reduced highway deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Miron | first =Jeffrey A.  |first2=Elina |last2=Tetelbaum |year=2009 |title=Does The Minimum Legal Drinking Age Save Lives? |journal=[[Economic Inquiry]] |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=317–336 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.2008.00179.x |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4319664/Miron_MinDrinkAgeLives.pdf?sequence=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, the Student Senate at the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]] rejected a proposal to urge that university's chancellor to sign the Amethyst Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2008/11/13/news/z09drinking.txt "UW–L students say no to drinking age debate],''[[La Crosse Tribune]]'', Retrieved on 2008-12-15&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly the first such attempt by a student body to ask a president or chancellor to sign on, the measure at [[UW–L]] was defeated 14-19 after three weeks' debate. Chancellor Joe Gow said this vote, "certainly defies the 'conventional wisdom' regarding young people being eager to lower the drinking age."&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.theracquet.net/media/storage/paper978/news/2008/11/19/News/Amethyst.Initiative.Debate.Finally.Over-3550675.shtml "Amethyst Initiative debate finally over],''[[The Racquet]]'', Retrieved on 2008-12-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a pair of researchers published a [[literature review]] in [[Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs]] of studies on the effect of the drinking age in response to the Amethyst Initiative; the review indicates support for the drinking age remaining at 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeJong|first1=W|last2=Blanchette|first2=J|title=Case closed: research evidence on the positive public health impact of the age 21 minimum legal drinking age in the United States.|journal=Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs.

'''Appreciative inquiry''' ('''AI''') is a model that seeks to engage stakeholders in self-determined change. According to Bushe "AI revolutionized the field of organization development and was a precursor to the rise of positive organization studies and the strengths based movement in American management."&lt;ref&gt;Bushe, G.R. (2013) The appreciative inquiry model.  In E.H. Kessler, (ed.) Encyclopedia of Management Theory, (Volume 1, pp. 41-44), Sage Publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed at [[Case Western Reserve University]]'s department of [[organizational behavior]], starting with a 1987 article by [[David Cooperrider]] and Suresh Srivastva.  They felt that the overuse of "problem solving" hampered any kind of social improvement, and what was needed were new methods of inquiry that would help generate new ideas and models for how to organize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D. L.|author2=Srivastva, S.|year=1987|chapter=Appreciative inquiry in organizational life|editor1=Woodman, R. W.|editor2=Pasmore, W.A.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Research in Organizational Change And Development|volume=Vol. 1|pages=129–169|location=Stamford, CT|publisher=JAI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cooperrider and Srivastva took a social constructionist approach, arguing that organizations are created, maintained and changed by conversations, and claiming that methods of organizing were only limited by people's imaginations and the agreements among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D. L.|author2=Barrett, F.|author3=Srivastva, S.|year=1995|contribution=Social construction and appreciative inquiry: A journey in organizational theory|editor1=Hosking, D.|editor2=Dachler, P.|editor3=Gergen, K.|title=Management and Organization: Relational Alternatives to Individualism|pages=157–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Cooperrider and [[Diana Whitney]] published an article outlining the five principles of AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D.L. |author2=Whitney, D|year=2001|chapter=A positive revolution in change|editor1=Cooperrider, D. L.|editor2=Sorenson, P.|editor3=Whitney, D.|editor4=Yeager, T.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Appreciative Inquiry: An Emerging Direction for Organization Development|pages=9–29|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=Stipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cooperrider, Whitney and several of their colleagues became centrally involved using AI to mid-wife the creation of the United Religions Initiative, a global organization dedicated to promoting grassroots interfaith cooperation for peace, justice and healing. This early partnership between URI and AI is chronicled in Birth of a Global Community: Appreciative Inquiry in Action by Charles Gibbs and Sally Mahé.  AI was also used in the first (1999) and subsequent meetings of business leaders that created the UN's Global Compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/intro/commentFeb05.cfm|title=Current Commentary on AI and Positive Change|author=Cooperrider, David|work=AI Commons|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another of the early applications, Cooperrider and Whitney taught AI to employees of GTE (now part of Verizon) resulting in improvements in employees' support for GTE's business direction and. as a part of continuous process improvement generated both improvements in revenue collection and cost savings earning GTE an [[ASTD]] award for the best organisational change program in the US in 1997."&lt;ref name="Bushe 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bushe, G.R.|author2=Kassam, A.|year=2005|title=When is appreciative inquiry transformational?

On May 8, 2010, Suresh Srivastva died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/suresh-srviastva|title=Suresh Srviastva|work=The Taos Institute|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervase Bushe, a researcher on the topic, published a 2011 review of the model, including its processes, critiques, and evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bushe, G. R.|layurl=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AITC.pdf|chapter=Appreciative Inquiry: Theory and Critique|year=2011|editor1=Boje, D.|editor2=Burnes, B. |editor3=Hassard, J.|title=The Routledge Companion To Organizational Change |pages=87–103|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published a history of the model in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gervasebushe.ca/Foundations_AI.pdf|title = Foundations of Appreciative Inquiry|date = 2012|website = Bushe's website|publisher = Appreciative Practitioner|last = Bushe|first = Gervase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis and principles ==

According to Bushe, AI "advocates collective inquiry into the best of what is, in order to imagine what could be, followed by collective design of a desired future state that is compelling and thus, does not require the use of incentives, coercion or persuasion for planned change to occur."&lt;ref name="Bushe, G.R. 2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2013|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/the_AI_model.pdf|title=The Appreciative Inquiry Model|editor= Kessler, E.|work=The Encyclopedia of Management Theory|publisher= Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model is based on the assumption that the questions we ask will tend to focus our attention in a particular direction, that organizations evolve in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately ask.&lt;ref&gt;Cooperrider, D.L. &amp; Whitney, D (2005) A positive revolution in change: Appreciative inquiry. In Cooperrider, D. L. Sorenson, P., Yeager, T. &amp; Whitney, D. (eds.) Appreciative Inquiry: Foundations in Positive Organization Development (pp.9-33).  Champaign, IL: Stipes.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 80's most methods of assessing and evaluating a situation and then proposing solutions were based on a ''deficiency'' model, predominantly asking questions such as "What are the problems?", "What's wrong?" or "What needs to be fixed?".  Instead of asking "What's the problem?", others couched the question in terms of "challenges", which still focused on deficiency, on what needs to be fixed or solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/|title=The Appreciative Inquiry Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Appreciative Inquiry was the first serious managerial method to refocus attention on what works, the positive core, and on what people really care about.  Today, these ways of approaching organizational change are common&lt;ref&gt;Bushe, G.R. &amp; Marhsak, R.M. (2015) ''Dialogic Organization Development: The Theory and Practice of Organizational Transformation.''  Oakdland, CA: Berrett-Koehler.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five principles of AI are:&lt;ref name="Bushe, G.R. 2013" /&gt;
# The ''constructionist principle'' proposes that what we believe to be true determines what we do, and thought and action emerge from relationships.  Through the language and discourse of day to day interactions, people co-construct the organizations they inhabit.  The purpose of inquiry is to stimulate new ideas, stories and images that generate new possibilities for action.
# The ''principle of simultaneity'' proposes that as we inquire into human systems we change them and the seeds of change, the things people think and talk about, what they discover and learn, are implicit in the very first questions asked.  Questions are never neutral, they are fateful, and social systems move in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately discuss.
# The ''poetic principle'' proposes that organizational life is expressed in the stories people tell each other every day, and the story of the organization is constantly being co-authored.  The words and topics chosen for inquiry have an impact far beyond just the words themselves.  They invoke sentiments, understandings, and worlds of meaning. In all phases of the inquiry effort is put into using words that point to, enliven and inspire the best in people.
# The ''anticipatory principle'' posits that what we do today is guided by our image of the future.  Human systems are forever projecting ahead of themselves a horizon of expectation that brings the future powerfully into the present as a mobilizing agent. Appreciative inquiry uses artful creation of positive imagery on a collective basis to refashion anticipatory reality.
# The ''positive principle'' proposes that momentum and sustainable change requires positive affect and social bonding.  Sentiments like hope, excitement, inspiration, camaraderie and joy increase creativity, openness to new ideas and people, and cognitive flexibility.  They also promote the strong connections and relationships between people, particularly between groups in conflict, required for collective inquiry and change.

Some researchers believe that excessive focus on dysfunctions can actually cause them to become worse or fail to become better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wallis, Claudia|date=January 17, 2005|work=Time Magazine|title=The Science of Happiness|url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/TimeMagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711093607/http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/timemagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf|archivedate=July 11, 2006 |deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, AI argues, when all members of an organization are motivated to understand and value the most favourable features of its culture, it can make rapid improvements.&lt;ref name="new-paradigm.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://www.new-paradigm.co.uk/Appreciative.htm|work=New Paradigm|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength-based methods are used in the creation of organizational development strategy and implementation of organizational effectiveness tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mt-online.com/component/content/article/77-february2007/228-building-strength-based-organizations.html|title=Building Strength-Based Organizations|first=Scott|last=Franklin|date=February 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928205741/http://www.mt-online.com/component/content/article/77-february2007/228-building-strength-based-organizations.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011|deadurl=y|work=Maintenance Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''appreciative'' mode of inquiry often relies on interviews to qualitatively understand the organization's potential strengths by looking at an organization's experience and its potential; the objective is to elucidate the assets and personal motivations that are its strengths.

Bushe has argued that mainstream proponents of AI focus too much attention on "the positive" and not enough on the transformation that AI can bring about through generating new ideas and the will to act on them.&lt;ref name="Bushe 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2007|title=Appreciative inquiry is not (just) about the positive|journal=Organization Development Practitioner|volume=39|issue=4|pages=30–35|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AI_pos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AI_generativity.pdf|title=Generative process, generative outcome: The transformational potential of appreciative inquiry|last=|first=|work=Organizational Generativity: The Appreciative Inquiry Summit and a Scholarship of Transformation|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|year=2013|isbn=|series=Advances in Appreciative Inquiry|volume=4|location=Bingley, UK|pages=|via=|author=Bushe, G.R.|editor1=D.L. Cooperrider|editor2=D.P. Zandee|editor3=L.N. Godwin|editor4=M. Avital|editor5=B. Boland|pp=89–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2010 comparative study in a school district he found that even in cases where no change occurred participants were highly positive during the AI process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2010|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/comparative_case.pdf|title=A comparative case study of appreciative inquiries in one organization: Implications for practice|journal=Revista de Cercetare si Interventie Sociala / Review of Research and Social Intervention|series=Special Issue on Appreciative Inquiry|volume=29|pages=7–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What distinguished those sites that experienced transformational changes was the creation of new ideas that gave people new ways to address old problems.  He argues that for transformational change to occur, AI must address problems that concern people enough to want to change.  However, AI addresses them not through problem-solving, but through generative images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2013|title= Dialogic OD: A theory of practice|journal=Organization Development Practitioner, special issue on advances in Dialogic Organization Development|volume=45|issue=1|pages= 10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this is covered in a 90-minute discussion about AI, positivity and generativity by Bushe and Dr. Ron Fry of Case Western, at the 2012 World Appreciative Inquiry Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Webcast Plenary Session 6: Prof. Dr. Ronald Fry and Prof. Dr. Gervase Bushe|url=http://www.2012waic.com/webcast-plenary-session-6-prof-dr-ronald-fry-and-prof-dr-gervase-bushe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguishing features ==

The following table comes from the Cooperrider and Whitney (2001){{full|date=September 2018}} article and is used to describe some of the distinctions between AI and approaches to organizational development not based on what they call positive potential:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Case Western Reserve University|work=Appreciative Inquiry Commons|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/intro/whatisai.cfm|title=What is Appreciative Inquiry?|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appreciative inquiry attempts to use ways of asking questions and envisioning the future in order to foster positive relationships and build on the present potential of a given person, organization or situation.  The most common model utilizes a cycle of four processes, which focus on what it calls:
#''DISCOVER:'' The identification of organizational processes that work well.
#''DREAM:'' The envisioning of processes that would work well in the future.
#''DESIGN:'' Planning and prioritizing processes that would work well.
#''DESTINY'' (or ''DEPLOY''): The implementation (execution) of the proposed design.&lt;ref name="new-paradigm.co.uk"/&gt;

The aim is to build – or rebuild – organizations around what works, rather than trying to fix what doesn't. AI practitioners try to convey this approach as the opposite of problem solving.

==Implementing AI==

There are a variety of approaches to implementing appreciative inquiry, including mass-mobilised interviews and a large, diverse gathering called an Appreciative Inquiry Summit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.positivechange.org/downloads/AI_and_Spiritual_ResonanceV.Final.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These approaches involve bringing large, diverse groups of people together to study and build upon the ''best'' in an organization or community.

== Uses ==

AI is used in organizational development and as a [[Management consulting|consultancy]] tool in an attempt to bring about strategic change. It has been applied in businesses, health care bodies, social non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and government operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/join/easySubmit.cfm|title=Easy Submit: Do you have a story, document, tool, event to share?|work= AI Commons|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originating in the US, it is also used in the UK – for example in the  [[National Support Teams]] and around the world.  Since 2000, ''The AI Practitioner'', a quarterly publication, has described applications in a variety of settings around the world.

AI has various business applications and can effectively be used to elicit information from stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe15/76385b5e4767493f3d51224c721494b6ec10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Positivity is paired with a group consensus to envision and begin producing an optimistic future based on existing strengths and successes. As seen in [[Harbarian process modeling]], AI has been used in [[Business process modeling]] to elicit information about an organization's present state and desired future state.

In Vancouver, AI is being used by the [[Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education]]. The Center, which was founded by the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and [[Victor Chan]], is using AI to facilitate compassionate communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart-Mind Inquiry|work=Dalai Lama Center|url=http://dalailamacenter.org/programs/programs-development/appreciative-inquiry|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is argued that the emotional role-playing between the care-receiver and a robot can actually have a more positive outcome in terms of creating the conditions of less fear and concern for one's own predicament best exemplified by the phrase: "if it is just a robot taking care of me it cannot be that critical." Scholars debate the possible outcome of such technology using two different perspectives. Either, the AE could help the socialization of care-givers, or serve as role model for emotional detachment.&lt;ref name="Baumgaertner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asada"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Affective Developmental Robotics |work=How can we design the development of artifcial empathy? |author=Minoru Asada |publisher=Dept. of Adaptive Machine Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University |location=Osaka, Japan |url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~kl360/HRI2014W/submission/S7.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''buddy system''' is a [[procedure (term)|procedure]] in which two people, the "buddies", operate together as a single unit so that they are able to monitor and help each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the buddy system? |url=http://www.becomeascout.org/faq.aspx |work=FAQs |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905063021/http://www.becomeascout.org/faq.aspx |archivedate=5 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As per Merriam-Webster, the first known use of the phrase “buddy system” goes as far back as 1942. Webster goes on to define the buddy system as “an arrangement in which two individuals are paired (as for mutual safety in a hazardous situation).” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buddy%20system&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieci.org/newsroom-and-insights/working-in-pairs-the-buddy-system&lt;/ref&gt;
The buddy system is basically working together in pairs in a large group or alone. Both the individuals have to do the job. The job could be to ensure that the work is finished safely or the skill/learning is transferred effectively from one individual to the other.

==Advantages==
In adventurous or dangerous activities, where buddies are often required, the main benefit of the system is improved [[safety]]; each may be able to prevent the other becoming a casualty or rescue the other in a crisis.

When this system is used as part of training or the induction of newcomers to an organization, the less experienced buddy learns more quickly from close and frequent contact with the experienced buddy than when operating alone.

==Organizations==
The buddy system is used in the [[United States Armed Forces]], and referred to by various names in each branch ("[[Wingman|Wingmen]]" in the Air Force, "Battle Buddies" in the Army, "Shipmates" in the Navy), as well as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]]&lt;ref name="scouts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Buddy_System |title=Buddy System in Swimming, Boating, Rappelling and other activities.|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used by religious organisations like the LDS Church. Members on mission form a [[Missionary (LDS Church)#Companionships|companionship]] constituted by two or sometimes more missionaries, which are not allowed to be alone for a two-year time period: "Stay Together. Never be alone. It is extremely important that you stay with your companion at all times."&lt;ref name="ldshandbook"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lds.org/manual/missionary-handbook/missionary-conduct?lang=eng | title=LDS Missionary Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buddy system is used in new employee induction for assisting with the formalities in an organization. The period could be from a month to two months. The buddy helps in acclimatizing the new employee to the culture and day to day aspects of working, in a shorter period of time. The buddy helps the new employee to become knowledgeable about department practices and organizational culture in a shorter period. The purpose of assigning new employees with a buddy is to help welcome employees and reaffirms their decision to join the organization. It provides new employees with a reliable, motivated, single point-of-contact for their basic questions regarding their work experience. The buddy system is an effective method to provide support, monitor stress, and reinforce safety procedures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/buddy-system.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The buddy system is also informally used by [[elementary school|school-aged]] children, especially on [[field trip]]s. Assigning each student a buddy provides an extra measure of safety and removes some of the burden of keeping an eye on a large number of children in an unfamiliar environment from the supervising adults.

The buddy system encourages open and effective dialogue among peers and tends to break down social barriers with their classmates. It helps create a collaborative learning environment in which peers feel less hesitant to raise questions. This enables students to develop social networks, cross-cultural experiences. It provides effective support for the students who are ‘at risk’ and to lower the attrition rate at the higher education level.

== Education ==

=== Benefits of a buddy system ===

A buddy system in a school is where a child gets paired with another child, usually one that is older and of higher abilities. A buddy system helps to promote friendship, better support of coursework, behavioral and social needs, and can foster a greater sense of belonging and a more inclusive school community.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008&gt;Hughes, C., &amp; Carter E.W. (2008). ''Peer Buddy Programs for Successful Secondary School Inclusion.'' Paul H. Brookes Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Students create friendships that enable both older and younger "buddies" to bond more closely with their school, increasing the likelihood of more positive school behavior and positive response towards learning for all students.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; The buddy system helps students starting at a new school have a welcoming experience from the very beginning. The older children learn to take on responsibility, while the younger children know that they have a fellow student they can confidently turn to for support.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015&gt;Anderson, M. K., Tenenbaum, L. S., Ramadorai, S. B., &amp; Yourick, D. L. (2015). "Near-peer mentor model: synergy within mentoring". ''Mentoring &amp; Tutoring: Partnership in Learning'', 23(2), 116–132.&lt;/ref&gt;
Buddy systems in schools can have numerous benefits such as promoting an inclusive environment for all,&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; better acceptance of differences, promoting better self-control, expansion of communicative interaction with peers,&lt;ref name=Quill1990&gt;Quill, K. A. (1990). "A model for integrating children with autism". ''Focus on Autistic Behavior'', 5(4), 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; decrease in behavioral problems,&lt;ref name=Fo1974&gt;Fo, W. S., &amp; O'Donnell, C. R. (1974). "The Buddy System: Relationship and contingency conditions in a community intervention program for youth with nonprofessionals as behavior change agents." ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'', 42(2), 163–169.&lt;/ref&gt; and even personal maturation or growth in career aspirations.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt;
The buddy system positively affects the culture of the school and it greatly affects the troubled student as well as the older buddy.
The students learn and share from their peers and learn collaboratively. The students actively participate with each other and enjoy the informal setting and feel comfortable discussing with peers rather than a teacher. The opportunity for active participation, clearing doubts and discussions help students to continue with studies or activities with joy and creates a depth in the subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The buddy system helps to increase self-confidence for all involved in the system and in the process helps build trust and co-operation within individuals. It benefits the buddies, buddy learner, school/university and the parents as well. The buddies involved also learn leadership skills and in turn can take up the role of buddy leader.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; 
The buddy system helps in reducing the stress level of the learner. It reduces the levels of anxiety experienced by the students who struggle to engage with course material or with the school/university in general.{{citation needed|reason= citation provided hereafter does not apply to students but to rats|date=August 2016}} "When there's a companion available, the physiological measure of stress—cortisol levels in the blood—can be alleviated somewhat", explains Jim Winslow, PhD, a specialist in behavioral neuroscience and pharmacology and head of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Research Program, Non-Human Primate Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andelson|first1=Rachel|title=Buddy system eases stress|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep04/buddy.aspx|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Teachers at progressive schools collaborate to improve their students' learning—and their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wagner|first1=Tony|title=The Buddy System|url=http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2005/01/01/04view.h16.html|website=www.edweek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives independence to all students, and increases self-esteem and peer acceptance. Children become protectors of each other.
Christine Hogan states that the buddy system approach is highly appropriate for organizational behavior studies adding to the students' range of learning strategies. The technique not only works with peers of the same nation but has also proved to be of particular importance to foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hogan, (1992) "'You are not studying alone': Introducing experiential learning into the teaching of organizational behaviour", ''Education + Training'', 34(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pairing types ===

There are numerous pairings styles: newly admitted students paired with older students, low achieving elementary school students paired with high achieving elementary school students;&lt;ref&gt;Freyberg, J. T., (1967). "The effects of participating in an elementary school buddy system on the self concept, school attitudes and behaviors, and achievement of fifth grade Negro children." ''Graduate Research in Urban Education &amp; Related Disciplines'', 3(1), 3–29.&lt;/ref&gt; behaviorally challenged teenagers paired with adults;&lt;ref name=Fo1974/&gt; autistic children paired with neurotypical children;&lt;ref name=Quill1990/&gt; severely disabled children paired with neurotypical children;&lt;ref name=Carter2001&gt;Carter, E. W., Hughes, C., Copeland, S. R., &amp; Breen, C. (2001). "Differences between high school students who do and do not volunteer to participate in a peer interaction program." ''Journal of the Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 26(4), 229–239.&lt;/ref&gt; and even college students paired with post-bachelor students.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt;

=== Metropolitan Nashville Peer Buddy Program ===

An example of a successful peer buddy system was in Nashville, Tennessee's McGavock High School. Teachers were concerned with having a more inclusive environment for special education students. Not only were the specialized students excluded academically but there was social exclusion as well. This adversely affects specialized students when there is a need for them to later assimilate when out of high school.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; Students with disabilities were eating with their buddies and their friends, which resulted in the expansion of their circle of friendship and thus allowed for the special needs students to feel more normal and included. The program was so successful it was later adopted in the other 11 high schools of that district.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt;

=== Buddy systems for mainstream students ===

There are more examples of buddy systems for developmentally challenged students than there are of students with normal development but with behavioral or academic needs.&lt;ref name=Fo1974/&gt; If a system can be implemented that can help autistic or behaviorally challenged children or children with intellectual disabilities, than similar buddy systems can be incorporated into mainstream classrooms to help aid students that have a hard time learning but who may not qualify for the special needs programs. Students with disabilities report feeling more included, able to start friendships and conversations,&lt;ref name=Carter2001/&gt; and these same benefits can be transferred over to students that have social problems but are not able to be in special needs programs. Similarly, a student who is struggling academically can be paired with someone more adept with certain subjects.

Peer buddy groups can benefit many people. More research is needed to understand the possible impact of buddy systems for the general student population. Students that qualify for special services receive a lot of attention but students struggling behaviorally and socially would highly benefit from such an inclusive service.

=== Implementation of buddy systems ===

Students that qualify for special needs services receive a lot of attention. For the students that do not qualify but might be struggling behaviorally and socially, then programs like these could potentially have similar benefits for them as well. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; promote a more ubiquitous peer buddy system in their book by laying out different strategies and benefits if schools were to include these systems in their curriculum. Examples they provide are: administrators assisting  in the publication of the program, school counselors signing up students for a credit based buddy system course, general education teachers providing support for special needs students who might be in there classroom and having parents providing impetus and support for a program to begin. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; suggest starting on a smaller scale, perhaps a classroom or two and then growing a base of support.

=== Peer-to-peer buddy systems for autistic students ===

A key element of education is to build empathy and understand other people in the society. This approach sees a small group of students in a class being made "buddies" for an autistic student. The students are made aware of particular challenge a student has and are asked to take special care to include them, to be on the lookout for any bullying or exclusion and to be supportive to the student if they get stressed out or upset at break time or in class.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The students who are selected would be chosen for their maturity and kindness. Parental consent would be sought from the parents of the students involved. While not every autistic student will instantly begin to socialise or make friends, this approach will at the very least ensure inclusion and also that there will be a friendly pair of eyes when teachers are not present or are out of ear-shot.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Everyone needs a buddy sometimes – maybe a student is having a bad day, is upset about something or just is not very good at starting conversations or making friends alone. Under this system, a class would explore difference as a whole and recognize that everyone in a class is different and so have different needs, strengths, abilities and oddities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} They would then either be paired up or each student would draw a name and become "buddy" to that person, perhaps without them even being made aware of it. Before the draw or pairing it could be discussed with the teacher, to ensure an autistic student gets an especially strong buddy.
The advantage of this system is that it does not single out the autistic student, especially if they are not comfortable with that, and instead includes everyone. Additionally, it gives the autistic person a role in being a buddy too, which can be used to teach social skills, expectations and etiquette.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Adam|title="Back to School": Buddy System|url=https://www.asiam.ie/back-school-buddy-system|website=asiam.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civic nationalism''', also known as '''liberal nationalism''', is a form of [[nationalism]] identified by [[political philosophy|political philosophers]] who believe in an inclusive form of [[nationalism]] that adheres with traditional liberal values of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auer|first1=Stefan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Central Europe|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134378602|page=5|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=BhNsM_ttOb4C&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamir, Yael. 1993.

''[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]]'' 10(3): 231-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Civic nationalism is frequently contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]].

[[Ernest Renan]] is often thought to be an early civic nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Renan. "[[What is a Nation?]]", 1882; cf. Chaim Gans, ''The Limits of Nationalism'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Civic nationhood is a political identity built around shared citizenship within the state. Thus, a "civic nation" isn't defined by its language or culture, but by its political institutions and liberal principles, which its citizens pledge to uphold. Membership in the civic nation is open to anyone who shares these values.&lt;ref name= definition&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|author=ANNA STILZ|title=Civic Nationalism and Language Policy|page=257|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, a civic nation or state does not aim to promote one culture over another.&lt;ref name = definition/&gt; German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] argued that immigrants to a [[Liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] state need not assimilate into the host culture, but only need to accept the principles of the country's constitution (cf. [[Constitutional patriotism]]).&lt;ref name = definition/&gt;

==History==
{{or-section|date=January 2017}}
Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of [[rationalism]] and [[liberalism]], but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]]. Membership of the civic [[nation]] is considered voluntary, as in [[Ernest Renan]]'s classical definition in "[[Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]" of the nation as a "daily referendum" characterized by the "will to live together".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Civic-national ideals influenced the development of [[representative democracy]] in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[France]] (see the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, and the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789).

The Corsican nationalist movement organized around the [[FLNC]] is giving a civic definition of the Corsican nation ("destiny communauty") in the continuity of [[Pasquale Paoli]] and the ideas of the [[Lumières]].

'''Civil courage''' is a type of courage, related closely to heroism, in which a person acts [[bravery|bravely]] to intervene in a social situation.

==Overview==
Italian journalist and writer {{ill|Franca Magnani|de}} (1925-1996) wrote, "Je mehr Bürger mit Zivilcourage ein Land hat, desto weniger Helden wird es einmal brauchen" ("The more citizens with civil courage which a country has, the fewer heroes it needs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/de/bereiche/sob/motivation/zivilcourage/zivilcourage.html |title=Über Zivilcourage |language=German |website=[[University of Zurich]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil Courage today ==

Civil courage has been referred to by [[psychologist]] Tobias Greitemeyer as constituting acts of [[bravery]], carried out with the objective of enforcing a societal or ethical standard, without concern for the effect these acts might have on one’s own position. In this way it is distinguished from [[alturism|altruistic]] behavior and other forms of courage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greitemeyer|first1=Tobias|title=Civil courage: Implicit theories, related concepts, and measurement|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=115–119|doi=10.1080/17439760701228789|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of altruistic, helping behavior, an individual might expect to be praised or receive positive social consequences from the result of their having helped, despite possible financial or material loss. In actions where civil courage is demonstrated, the person carrying out the action may experience negative social consequences such as alienation, verbal abuse or violence. Civil courage is displayed when a person, in spite of the perceived threat of negative consequences acts to intervene in a social context. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osswald|first1=Silvia|title=What Is Moral Courage?

'''Collective effervescence''' ('''CE''') is a sociological concept introduced by [[Émile Durkheim]]. According to Durkheim, a community or society may at times come together and simultaneously communicate the same thought and participate in the same action. Such an event then causes collective effervescence which excites individuals and serves to unify the group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/durkheim/&lt;/ref&gt;

== In religion ==
Collective effervescence is the basis for [[Émile Durkheim]]'s [[theories of religions|theory of religion]] as laid out in his 1912 volume ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life|Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''. Durkheim argues that the universal religious [[dichotomy of profane and sacred]] results from the lives of these tribe members: most of their life is spent performing menial tasks such as hunting and gathering. These tasks are profane. The rare occasions on which the entire tribe gathers together become sacred, and the high energy level associated with these events gets directed onto physical objects or people which also become sacred.

The force is thus associated with the [[totem]] which is the symbol of the clan, mentioned by Durkheim in his study of "elementary forms" of religion in Aboriginal societies. Because it provides the tribe's name, the symbol is present during the gathering of the clan. Its presence during these scenes, the totem comes to represent both the scene and the strong emotional felt, thus becoming a collective representation of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Griswold, Wendy, ''Cultures and Societies in a Changing World'', Pine Forge Press, 2008; 51-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Durkheim, religion is a fundamentally social phenomenon. The beliefs and practices of the sacred are a method of [[social organization]]. This explanation is detailed in ''Elementary Forms'' "Book 2/The Elementary Beliefs", chapter 7, "Origins of These Beliefs: Origin of the Idea of the [[Totem]]ic Principle or [[Mana]]". According to Durkheim, "god and society are one of the same…the god of the clan…can be none other than the clan itself, but the clan transfigured and imagined in the physical form of a plant or animal that serves as a totem."&lt;ref name=Durkheim&gt;Durkheim 1995, p. 208 (1965, p. 236).&lt;/ref&gt;

The group members experience a feeling of a loss of individuality and unity with the gods and according to Durkheim, thus with the group.&lt;ref&gt;Kunin, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7533">The '''Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking''', or CMIS, is a theoretical construct designed to predict how people will seek information.  It was first developed by J. David Johnson and has been utilized by a variety of disciplines including [[Library and Information Science]] and [[Health Communication]].

The CMIS has been empirically tested in health and organizational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D., &amp; Meischke, H. (1993). Cancer-related channel selection:  An extensionfor a sample of women who have had a mammogram. Women &amp; Health, 20, 31-44.; Johnson, J. D., Donohue, W. A., Atkin, C. K., &amp; Johnson, S. H. (1995). A comprehensive model of information seeking: Tests focusing on a technical organization. 
Science Communication, 16, 274-303.&lt;/ref&gt; It has inherent strengths for studying how people react to health problems such as cancer.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Johnson, J. D., Andrews, J. E. &amp; Allard, S. (2001). A Model for Understanding and Affecting Genetics Information Seeking. Library and Information Science Research 23(4): 335-349.&lt;/ref&gt; It specifies "antecedents" that explain why people become information seekers, "information carrier characteristic" that shape how they go about looking for information, and "information seeking actions" that reflect the nature of the search itself.

==Design==

[[File:Diagram of the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking.jpg|thumb|right|The Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking]]
The CMIS has been quantitatively tested and performs well when it comes to health information seeking behaviors (HISB).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There are three main schemas in the CMIS. These are:  Antecedents, information field, and information seeking actions.  The antecedents are those factors that determine how an information consumer will receive the information.  Those factors are:  Demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs.  These factors are fluid and can change during the health information seeking process.  The second schema is the information fields that consist of characteristics and utilities.  This schema is concerned with the channels and carriers of information.  A person’s understanding is developed through the information field.  The third schema involves the transformational processes and measured by the consumer’s understanding of the messages received through the information field.  The final schema involves information seeking actions.  This is what the consumer does as a result of the first two schemas through information seeking.  There are three major dimensions:  the scope, depth, and method of information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Antecedents==
The CMIS antecedents—demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs—are factors that determine an individual's natural predisposition to search for information from particular information carriers. Certain types of health information seeking can be triggered by an individual's degree of personal experience with disease.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D. (1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the CMIS framework, two personal relevance factors, salience and beliefs, are seen as the primary determinants in translating a perceived gap into an active search for information. Salience refers to the personal significance of health information to the individual, such as perceptions of risk to one's health, which are likely to result in information seeking action. However, people also may be motivated to gather information to determine the implications of health events for themselves and/or others related to their future activities, a factor directly related to the rapidly growing field of genetics. An individual's beliefs about the nature of a particular disease, its impacts, and level of control, all directly relate to self-efficacy, one of our key variables, and one that plays an important role in information seeking and people's more general pattern of actions related to health.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D.(1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information Carrier Characteristics==

The information carrier characteristics are drawn from a model of Media Exposure and Appraisal (MEA) that has been tested on a variety of information carriers, including both sources and channels, and in a variety of cultural settings. Following the MEA, the CMIS focuses on editorial tone, communication potential, and utility. In the CMIS, characteristics are composed of editorial tone, which reflects an audience member's perception of credibility, while communication potential relates to issues of style and comprehensiveness. Utility relates the characteristics of a medium directly to the needs of an individual, and shares much with the uses and gratifications perspectives. For example, is the information contained in the medium relevant, topical, and important for the individual's purposes? In general, utility is very important for health information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Information Seeking Actions==

There are several types of information seeking actions that can result from the impetus provided by the factors identified by the CMIS. For example, search behavior can be characterized by its extent, or the number of activities carried out, which has two components: scope, the number of alternatives investigated; and, depth, the number of dimensions of an alternative investigated. There is also the method of the search, or channel, as another major dimension of the search.  For instance, an individual might choose the method of consulting a telephone information service, decide to have a narrow scope by only asking questions about smoking cessation clinics, but investigate every recommendation in detail, thus increasing the depth of the search.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Stages in the CMIS==

A key concept from the CMIS is the notion of “stages,” or “cancer involvement”.  According to the CMIS, an individual may be at one of four stages regarding a cancer threat, and thereby have differing information needs and behaviors.

The first stage, ''Casual'', is characterized by a general lack of concern or interest. At this stage, individuals are not purposive in their search for cancer-related information; rather, their search is accidental and aimless, even apathetic.
 
The second stage is ''Purposive-Placid''. This is characterized by the question, “What can I do to prevent cancer?” Individuals here might have some passing interest in cancer or genetic information, but are generally still not affected or directly concerned.

The third stage is ''Purposive-Clustered''. Here, an individual will be in closer proximity to cancer. This is the point at which a person is motivated to look for practical information that will address the specific problem. For example, a first-degree relative of a recently diagnosed breast cancer patient may seek genetic screening or [[BRCA mutation|BRCA]] 1/2 testing. The person could clearly benefit from such information- seeking behavior since medical authorities acknowledge that early detection of cancer leads to earlier treatments and better treatment outcomes.

The fourth stage, ''Directed'', includes individuals who have been diagnosed as having cancer. Such individuals need knowledge for making informed decisions about treatment and management of the disease.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

{{Redirect|Succinct}}
'''Concision''' (alternatively '''brevity''', '''laconicism''', '''terseness''', or '''conciseness''') is the cutting out of unnecessary words while conveying an idea. It aims to enhance communication by eliminating [[redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] without omitting important information. Concision has been described as one of the elementary principles of writing.&lt;ref name="tEoS"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Strunk |title=The Elements of Style |year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related concept of '''succinctness''' is the opposite of [[verbosity]].

==Description==
Concision means to be economical with words, expressing what's needed using the fewest words necessary.&lt;ref name="Concision"&gt;"What is Concision?" Accessed February 4, 2017. [https://concision.co.uk/concision/ Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; That may involve removing redundant or unnecessary phrases or replacing them with shorter ones. It is described in ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' by [[Strunk and White]] as follows:&lt;ref name="tEoS"/&gt;

{{quote|Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.|Elementary Principles of Composition, ''The Elements of Style''}}

Concision has also been described as "eliminat[ing] words that take up space without saying much."&lt;ref name="Boulder"&gt;Program for Writing and Rhetoric, University of Colorado at Boulder. "Writing Tip #27: Revising for Concision and Clarity." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.colorado.edu/pwr/writingtips/27.html Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples include replacing "{{sic|due to the fact that}}" with "because" or "at this point in time" with "now" or "currently."&lt;ref name="UNT"&gt;UNT Writing Lab. "Concision, Clarity, and Cohesion." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.unt.edu/writinglab/UNTOWL_Concision_Clarity_and_Cohesion.pdf Link.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example sentence, with explanation:&lt;ref name="Boulder"/&gt;

{{quote|'''"It is a fact that most arguments must try to convince readers, that is the audience, that the arguments are true."''' Notice the beginning of the sentence: "it is a fact that" doesn't say much; if something is a fact, just present it. So begin the sentence with "most arguments..." and turn to the next bit of overlap. Look at "readers, that is the audience"; the redundancy can be reduced to "readers" or "audience." Now we have "Most arguments must try to convince readers that the arguments are true." Let's get rid of one of the "arguments" to produce '''"Most arguments must demonstrate (their) truth to readers,"''' or a similarly straightforward expression.}}

==Example paragraph==
The following example is taken from:&lt;ref name="UNT"/&gt;

{{quote|The author of the poem illustrated various differences between the characters. The poem, which was a [[romantic poem]], showed that each individual character was sort of devious in the way in which he or she did things and behaved. The two characters in the poem, who were named Jim and Dwight, were never definitely and completely honest with each other, which led to the final outcome of them being unhappy. This outcome, which was undesirable, is designed in a way to show the readers just exactly how the author feels about lying and deceit.}}

The source suggests this replacement:

{{quote|The romantic poem showed that its characters were devious. Jim and Dwight, the poem’s two characters, were never honest with each other and ended up unhappy. This undesirable outcome shows the readers how the author feels about lying.}}

In the second quote, the same information is communicated in less than half the length. However, it could be more concisely rewritten and communicate the same information:

{{quote|The romantic poem’s characters, Jim and Dwight, were dishonest with each other and ended up unhappy, showing the author's feelings about lying.}}

==Teaching concise expression==
Concise expression, particularly in writing, is considered one of the basic goals of teaching the English language.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Buczynski, Kristin Fontichiaro, ''Story Starters and Science Notebooking: Developing Student Thinking Through Literacy and Inquiry'' (2009), p. 7, {{ISBN|1591586860}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques to achieve concise writing are taught for students at all levels, from the introduction to writing to the preparation of PhD dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, ''Authoring a PhD: How to Plan, Draft, Write and Finish a Doctoral Thesis or Dissertation'' (2003), p. 273, {{ISBN|023036800X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and legal writing for law students.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Writing Institute, ''Legal Writing: The Journal of the Legal Writing Institute'' (2002), Vol. 7, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that although "in expository prose English places a high value on conciseness... [t]he value placed on conciseness... is not shared by all cultures", with, for example, the [[Thai culture]] as one where redundancy is prized as an opportunity to use additional words to demonstrate the writer's command of the language.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"&gt;Mark Newell Brock, Larry Walters, ''Teaching Composition Around the Pacific Rim: Politics and Pedagogy'' (1992), p. 4-5, {{ISBN|1853591602}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to a tendency for people from those cultures to use repetitive or redundant phrasing when learning English.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"/&gt;

==Succinctness==
The related concept of '''succinctness''' is a characteristic of [[Plain language|speech]],&lt;ref name=Garner2009b&gt;{{cite book | last1=Garner| first1=Bryan A.| author1-link=Bryan A. Garner| title=[[Garner on Language and Writing]]: Selected Essays and Speeches of Bryan A. Garner| year=2009| publisher=American Bar Association| location=Chicago| isbn=1-60442-445-1| page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[laconic phrase|writing]],&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Kurke, Aesopic Conversations: Popular Tradition, Cultural Dialogue, and the Invention of Greek Prose, Princeton University Press, 2010, pp. 131–2, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; [[succinct data structure|data structure]],&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, G. J (1988).

Ockham's Razor: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Ockham's Principle of Parsimony. Champaign-Urbana, University of Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; exhibiting both clarity and brevity. It is the opposite of verbosity, in which there is an excess of words.

Brevity in succinctness is not achieved by shortening original material by [[code|coding]] or [[Data compression|compressing]] it, but rather by omitting [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundant]] material from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1294">A '''Council for Voluntary Service''' (CVS) is a type of charity in [[England]].  CVSs are "the place at which local voluntary and community organisations speak to each other".  They offer a wide variety of services and support for local organisations, for example training, or advice on funding.

CVSs are also involved in [[advocacy]] for the organisations they represent, and aid in communication between the local voluntary and community sector and the statutory sector.  They will typically provide fora for organisations to meet, often a [[Community Empowerment Network]], and will interact with, or have a seat on, the [[local strategic partnership]].  They may also [[advocate]] on behalf of the organisations they represent on a one-to-one basis.

A CVS may or may not incorporate the local volunteer centre.

CVS are brought together nationally by the [[National Association for Voluntary and Community Action]] (which before 14 June 2006 was known as NACVS, the National Association of Councils for voluntary service). 

Each county in [[Wales]] has a [[County Voluntary Council]] rather than a CVS.

'''Deliberative democracy''' or '''discursive democracy'''  is a form of [[democracy]] in which [[deliberation]] is central to [[decision-making]]. It adopts elements of both [[consensus decision-making]] and [[majority rule]].  Deliberative democracy differs from traditional democratic [[political theory|theory]] in that authentic deliberation, not mere [[vote|voting]], is the primary source of legitimacy for the [[law]].

While deliberative democracy is generally seen as some form of an amalgam of [[representative democracy]] and [[direct democracy]], the actual relationship is usually open to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landemore|first=HÉLÈNE|date=2017|title=Deliberative Democracy as Open, Not ( Just) Representative Democracy|url=|journal=Dædalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners and theorists use the term to encompass representative bodies whose members authentically deliberate on legislation without unequal distributions of power, while others use the term exclusively to refer to decision-making directly by lay citizens, as in direct democracy.

The term "deliberative democracy" was originally coined by Joseph M. Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the Press Clause to Amplify Civic Discourse beyond Mere Opinion Sharing|author=Akilah N.

==Overview==
Deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. ''Authentic deliberation'' is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sze.hu/~smuk/Nyilvanossag_torvenyek_CEE/Szakirodalom/Deliberat%C3%ADv%20demokr%C3%A1cia/deliberative%20democracy%20book.pdf#page=72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leibj|first=Ethan|year=1997|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Threlkeld, Simon. “A Blueprint for Democratic Law-making: Give Citizen Juries the Final Say.” Social Policy, Summer, 1998, pp 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; If the decision-makers cannot reach [[consensus]] after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The roots of deliberative democracy can be traced back to [[Aristotle]] and his notion of politics; however, the German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]]' work on communicative rationality and the public sphere is often identified as a major work in this area.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief overview of the roots and different streams of deliberative democracy, see Ercan, S.A. (2014) 'Deliberative democracy', in: D. Phillips (ed.), Encyclopedia of educational theory and philosophy. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, pp.214-216 http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book238016&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative democracy can be practiced by decision-makers in both [[representative democracy|representative democracies]] and [[direct democracy|direct democracies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Introduction}} Elster offers a summary of the various common definitions that academics use for the term.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''elitist deliberative democracy,'' principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies, such as [[legislature]]s and [[court]]s; in ''populist deliberative democracy,'' principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leibj|first=Ethan J.|year=1997|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic [[public opinion]] about societal issues but not directly create binding law; devices such as the [[deliberative opinion poll]] have been designed to achieve this goal. Another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of [[direct democracy]], where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a "public will" and directly creates binding law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leibj|first=Ethan J.|year=1997|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Threlkeld, Simon. “A Blueprint for Democratic Law-making: Give Citizen Juries the Final Say.” Social Policy, Summer, 1998, pp 5-9.&lt;/ref&gt; If political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives, then there is no democratic element; this deliberative process is called ''elite deliberation''.&lt;ref name="fishkin 2 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|location=Chapters 2 &amp; 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fishkin, this process attempts to indirectly filter the mass public opinion because representatives are better equipped with the knowledge of the common good than ordinary citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When the People Speak: Deliberative Democracy and Public Consultation|last=S. Fishkin|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199572106|location=New York|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Fishkin's model of deliberation===
[[James Fishkin]], who has designed practical implementations of deliberative democracy for over 15 years in various countries,&lt;ref name="ross 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Carne|year=2011|location=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes five characteristics essential for legitimate deliberation:
:*''Information'': The extent to which participants are given access to reasonably accurate information that they believe to be relevant to the issue
:* ''Substantive balance'': The extent to which arguments offered by one side or from one perspective are answered by considerations offered by those who hold other perspectives
:* ''Diversity'': The extent to which the major position in the public are represented by participants in the discussion
:* ''Conscientiousness'': The extent to which participants sincerely weigh the merits of the arguments
:* ''Equal consideration'': The extent to which arguments offered by all participants are considered on the merits regardless of which participants offer them &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = When the People speak|last = Fishkin|first = James S.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-19-957210-6|location = Oxford|pages = 160f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Fishkin's definition of deliberative democracy, lay citizens must participate in the decision-making process, thus making it a subtype of [[direct democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|location=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Fishkin and Robert Luskin suggest that deliberative discussion should be:&lt;ref&gt;Fishkin, J. S., &amp; Luskin, R. C. (2005). Experimenting with a democratic ideal: Deliberative polling and public opinion. Acta Politica, 40(3), 284–298.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Informed'' (and thus informative). Arguments should be supported by appropriate and reasonably accurate factual claims.
# ''Balanced''. Arguments should be met by contrary arguments.
# ''Conscientious''. The participants should be willing to talk and listen, with civility and respect.
# ''Substantive''. Arguments should be considered sincerely on their merits, not on how they are made or by who is making them.
# ''Comprehensive''. All points of view held by significant portions of the population should receive attention.

===Cohen's outline===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
[[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], a student of [[John Rawls]], outlined conditions that he thinks constitute the root principles of the theory of deliberative democracy, in the article "Deliberation and Democratic Legitimacy" in the 1989 book ''The Good Polity''.  He outlines five main features of deliberative democracy, which include:

# An ongoing independent association with expected continuation.
# The citizens in the democracy structure their institutions such that deliberation is the deciding factor in the creation of the institutions and the institutions allow deliberation to continue.
# A commitment to the respect of a pluralism of values and aims within the polity.
# The citizens consider deliberative procedure as the source of legitimacy, and prefer the causal history of legitimation for each law to be transparent and easily traceable to the deliberative process.
# Each member recognizes and respects other members' deliberative capacity.
This can be construed as the idea that in the legislative process, we "owe" one another reasons for our proposals.

Cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy, and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving "ideal deliberation":
# It is free in two ways:
## The participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation.  They are free from any authority of prior norms or requirements.
## The participants suppose that they can act on the decision made; the deliberative process is a sufficient reason to comply with the decision reached.
# Parties to deliberation are required to state reasons for their proposals, and proposals are accepted or rejected based on the reasons given, as the content of the very deliberation taking place.
# Participants are equal in two ways:
## Formal: anyone can put forth proposals, criticize, and support measures.  There is no substantive hierarchy.
## Substantive: The participants are not limited or bound by certain distributions of power, resources, or pre-existing norms. "The participants…do not regard themselves as bound by the existing system of rights, except insofar as that system establishes the framework of free deliberation among equals."
# Deliberation aims at a rationally motivated [[consensus]]: it aims to find reasons acceptable to all who are committed to such a system of decision-making.  When consensus or something near enough is not possible, [[majority rule|majoritarian decision making]] is used.

In ''Democracy and Liberty'', an essay published in 1998, Cohen reiterated many of these points, also emphasizing the concept of "reasonable pluralism" – the acceptance of different, incompatible worldviews and the importance of good faith deliberative efforts to ensure that as far as possible the holders of these views can live together on terms acceptable to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 8 (essay by Cohen)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gutmann and Thompson's model===
[[Amy Gutmann]] and [[Dennis F. Thompson]]'s definition captures the elements that are found in most conceptions of deliberative democracy. They define it as "a form of government in which free and equal citizens and their representatives justify decisions in a process in which they give one another reasons that are mutually acceptable and generally accessible, with the aim of reaching decisions that are binding on all at present but open to challenge in the future".&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson (2004). ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' pp. 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

They state that deliberative democracy has four requirements, which refer to the kind of reasons that citizens and their representatives are expected to give to one another:
# Reciprocal. The reasons should be acceptable to free and equal persons seeking fair terms of cooperation. 
# Accessible. The reasons must be given in public and the content must be understandable to the relevant audience.
# Binding. The reason-giving process leads to a decision or law that is enforced for some period of time.  The participants do not deliberate just for the sake of deliberation or for individual enlightenment. 
# Dynamic or Provisional. The participants must keep open the possibility of changing their minds, and continuing a reason-giving dialogue that can challenge previous decisions and laws.

===Strengths and weaknesses===
A claimed strength of deliberative democratic models is that they are more easily able to incorporate [[science|scientific]] opinion and base policy on outputs of ongoing research, because:
*Time is given for all participants to understand and discuss the science
*Scientific peer review, adversarial presentation of competing arguments, refereed journals, even betting markets, are also deliberative processes.
*The technology used to record dissent and document opinions opposed to the majority is also useful to notarize bets, predictions and claims.

According to proponents such as [[James Fearon]], another strength of deliberative democratic models is that they tend, more than any other model, to generate ideal conditions of [[impartiality]], [[rationality]] and [[knowledge]] of the relevant facts. The more these conditions are fulfilled, the greater the likelihood that the decisions reached are [[ethics|morally correct]]. Deliberative democracy takes on the role of an "[[epistemic democracy]]" in this way, as it thus has an ''[[epistemic]]'' value: it allows participants to deduce what is morally correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 2 (essay by Fearon)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been prominently held by [[Carlos Nino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nino|first=Carlos|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by [[James Fishkin]] and others have found that deliberative democracy tends to produce outcomes which are superior to those in other forms of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan C. Strokes in her critical essay ''Pathologies of Deliberation'' (Chapter 5 of Elster 1998) concedes there that a majority of academics interested agree with this view.&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberative democracy produces less partisanship and more sympathy with opposing views; more respect for evidence-based reasoning rather than opinion; a greater commitment to the decisions taken by those involved; and a greater chance for widely shared consensus to emerge, thus promoting social cohesion between people from different backgrounds.&lt;ref name="fishkin 2 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ross 3"/&gt; Fishkin cites extensive empirical support for the increase in public spiritedness that is often caused by participation in deliberation, and says theoretical support can be traced back to foundational democratic thinkers such as [[John Stuart Mill]]  and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Chapter 5 of Fishkin (2011), which gives detailed citations to the empirical work. The specific Mill work cited is ''Considerations on Representative Government'' (1861), and the specific Tocqueville work cited is ''Democracy in America'' (1835).&lt;/ref&gt; Former diplomat [[Carne Ross]] writes that in 2011 that the debates arising from deliberative democracy are also much more civil, collaborative, and evidence-based than the debates in traditional town hall meetings or in internet forums. For Ross, the key reason for this is that in deliberative democracy citizens are empowered by knowledge that their debates will have a measurable impact on society.&lt;ref name="ross 3"/&gt;

A claimed failure of most theories of deliberative democracy is that they do not address the problems of voting. [[James Fishkin]]'s 1991 work, "Democracy and Deliberation", introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making, by way of what he calls the [[deliberative opinion poll]]. In the deliberative opinion poll, a statistically representative sample of the nation or a community is gathered to discuss an issue in conditions that further deliberation. The group is then polled, and the results of the poll and the actual deliberation can be used both as a recommending force and in certain circumstances, to replace a vote. Dozens of deliberative opinion polls have been conducted across the United States since his book was published.

The political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]] has criticized deliberative democracy on four grounds: (i) the rules for deliberation that deliberative theorists affirm interfere with, rather than facilitate, good practical reasoning; (ii) deliberative democracy is ideologically biased in favor of liberalism as well as republican over parliamentary democratic systems; (iii) deliberative democrats assert a too-sharp division between just and rational deliberation on the one hand and self-interested and coercive bargaining or negotiation on the other; and (iv) deliberative democrats encourage an adversarial relationship between state and society, one that undermines solidarity between citizens.

A criticism of deliberation is that potentially it allows those most skilled in rhetoric to sway the decision in their favour. This criticism has been made since deliberative democracy first arose in [[Ancient Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryzek|first=John|year=2010|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Consensus-based decision making similar to deliberative democracy is characteristic of the hunter gather [[Band society|band societies]] thought to predominate in pre-historical times. As some of these societies became more complex with developments like [[division of labour]], community-based decision making was displaced by various forms of authoritarian rule. The first example of democracy arose in Greece as [[Athenian democracy]] during the sixth century BC. Athenian democracy was both ''deliberative'' and largely ''direct'': some decisions were made by representatives but most were made by ″the people″&lt;!--not all, but some only--&gt; directly. Athenian democracy came to an end in 322BC. When democracy was revived as a political system about 2000 years later, decisions were made by representatives rather than directly by the people. In a sense, this revived version was deliberative from its beginnings; for example, in 1774 [[Edmund Burke]] made a famous speech where he called Great Britain's parliament a [[deliberative assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Edmund|year=1854|pages=446–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elster 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] considered deliberation an essential part of the government they created in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Jon|year=1998|location=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deliberative element of democracy was not widely studied by academics until the late 20th century. Although some of the seminal work was done in the 1970s and 80s, it was only in 1990 that deliberative democracy began to attract substantial attention from political scientists.&lt;ref name="dryzek 6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryzek|first=John|year=2010|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor [[John Dryzek]], early work on Deliberative Democracy was part of efforts to develop a theory of [[Democratic legitimacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryzek|first=John|year=2010|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Carne Ross]] advocate deliberative democracy as a complete alternative to representative democracy. The more common view, held by contributors such as [[James Fishkin]], is that direct deliberative democracy can be complementary to traditional representative democracy. Since 1994, hundreds of implementations of direct deliberative democracy have taken place throughout the world. For example, lay citizens have used deliberative democracy to determine local budget allocations in various cities and to undertake major public projects, such as the rebuilding of [[New Orleans]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name="elster 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|location=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ross 3"/&gt;

==Association with political movements==
Deliberative democracy recognizes a [[conflict of interest]] between the citizen participating, those affected or victimized by the process being undertaken, and the [[group-entity]] that organizes the decision.  Thus it usually involves an extensive [[outreach]] effort to include marginalized, isolated, ignored groups in decisions, and to extensively document [[dissent]], grounds for dissent, and future predictions of consequences of actions.  It focuses as much on the process as the results.  In this form it is a complete theory of [[civics]].

On the other hand, many practitioners of deliberative democracy attempt to be as neutral and open-ended as possible, inviting (or even randomly selecting) people who represent a wide range of views and providing them with balanced materials to guide their discussions. Examples include [[National Issues Forums]], Choices for the 21st Century, study circles, [[deliberative opinion poll]]s, the [[Citizens' Initiative Review]], and the 21st-century town meetings convened by [[AmericaSpeaks]], among others. In these cases, deliberative democracy is not connected to [[left-wing politics]] but is intended to create a conversation among people of different philosophies and beliefs.

In Canada, there have been two prominent applications of deliberative democratic models. In 2004, the British Columbia Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform convened a policy jury to consider alternatives to the first-past-the-post electoral systems. In 2007, the Ontario Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform convened to consider alternative electoral systems in that province.  Similarly, three of Ontario's Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) have referred their budget priorities to a [[policy jury]] for advice and refinement.

The [[Green Party of the United States]] refers to its particular proposals for [[grassroots democracy]] and [[electoral reform]] by this name. Although not always the case,  participation in deliberation has often been found to shift participants opinions in favour of Green positions, and can even cause a favourable change of voting intention.&lt;ref name="fishkin x"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkin|first=James|year=2011|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Graham|year=2003|location=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, with Europolis 2009, at the time one of the largest deliberative assemblies ever held, which set out to assess the public's view on a wide range of issues and included representatives from all 27 [[European Union|EU]] member nations, the share of citizens intending to vote for the Greens increased from 8% to 18%.&lt;ref name="fishkin x"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic contributors==
According to Professor Stephen Tierney, perhaps the earliest notable example of academic interest in the deliberative aspects of democracy occurred in [[John Rawls]] 1971 work ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agc-wopac.agc.gov.my/e-docs/Journal/0000013841.pdf Constitutional referendums: a theoretical enquiry (2009)] by Prof Stephen Tierney (see esp. ft note 67)&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph M. Bessette coined the term "deliberative democracy" in his 1980 work "Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government",&lt;ref name="dryzek 6"/&gt; and went on to elaborate and defend the notion in "The Mild Voice of Reason" (1994). Others contributing to the notion of deliberative democracy include [[Carlos Nino]],  [[Jon Elster]], [[Roberto Gargarella]], [[John Gastil]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[David Held]], [[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], John Rawls, [[Amy Gutmann]], [[Noëlle McAfee]], [[John Dryzek]], [[Rense Bos]], [[James S. Fishkin]], [[Jane Mansbridge]], [[Jose Luis Marti]], [[Dennis Frank Thompson|Dennis Thompson]], [[Benny Hjern]], [[Hal Koch]], [[Seyla Benhabib]], [[Ethan Leib]], [[Charles Sabel]], [[Jeffrey K. Tulis]], [[David Estlund]], [[Mariah Zeisberg]], Jeffrey L. McNairn, [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Robert B. Talisse]].

Although political theorists took the lead in the study of deliberative democracy, political scientists have in recent years begun to investigate its processes. One of the main challenges currently is to discover more about the actual conditions under which the ideals of deliberative democracy are more or less likely to be realized.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F (2008). “Deliberative Democratic Theory and Empirical Political Science,” ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 11: 497-520. {{ISBN|978-0824333119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entertainment technology''' is the discipline of using manufactured or created components to enhance or make possible any sort of [[entertainment]] experience.  Because entertainment categories are so broad, and because entertainment models the world in many ways, the types of implemented technology are derived from a variety of sources.  Thus, in theatre, for example, entertainment technology practitioners must be able to design and construct [[scenery]], install electrical systems, build clothing, use motors if there is [[scenery automation]],{{clarify|date=January 2018}} provide plumbing (if functioning kitchen fixtures are required, or if "singing in the rain"), etc. In this way, the entertainment technology field intersects with most other types of technology.

Traditionally, entertainment technology is derived from theatrical [[stagecraft]], and stagecraft is an important subset of the discipline. However, the rise of new types and venues for entertainment, as well as rapidly advancing technological development, has increased the range and scope of its practice.

Entertainment technology includes:

*[[Scenery]] [[Manufacturing|fabrication]]
*[[Theatrical property|Properties]]
*[[Costume]]
*[[Lighting]]
*[[Sound]]
*[[Video]]
*[[Show control]]
*[[Automation]]
*[[Animatronics]]
*Interactive environments
*[[Computer simulation]]

In animation and game design, the phrase "entertainment technology" refers to a very real world of [[entertainment]] experiences made possible by the advent of primarily computer-mediated digital technologies.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

== History ==
Entertainment Technology can be traced back to the “Pre-digital Age.” The invention of the first phonograph machine, which is used to record and playback sound, dates back to 1877 by inventor Thomas Edison. There has been a significant progression from that antiquated modality of entertainment. From silent films (which also gave way to the art of creative storytelling using moving pictures) to the digital age, in which we now see growth on a global scale and, relative to earlier inventions, an extremely fast pace. By comparison, from the invention of the phonograph machine in 1877 to the invention of the first motion picture camera by Louis Lumiere in 1895 shows a gap of 18 years between significant entertainment technology inventions. Whereas compact discs were introduced in the 1980’s and within the next 10 years, satellite television was introduced. More recent developments in entertainment technology are sometimes considered to be a “race” in terms of which company will develop and distribute their product first. Knowing what we have available to us and where it all began can be used as a footnote in our ever-increasing development of entertainment and other technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6182692|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Society ==
Society has completely been changed and advanced in many different ways by all the advancements in entertainment technology. Ranging from how companies get their product name out and get customers to buy into that product, to how people come into contact with one another and how we converse. Media and entertainment have become such a huge part of everyone’s life. We are all invested in some kind of media whether it is a tv show or a vlog and the producer of those are all very aware of the consumption of their product and will try to advertise it in as many ways as possible. They will reach out and promote their form of entertainment by having it on multiple platforms. Media companies will share their product on many different popular websites and forms of social media and ask its consumers to share it as well, generating more views and continuously advancing their products notoriety. Millions of dollars have been spent on Artificial Intelligence. Companies use AI because it is so detailed and precise with all of its obtained knowledge, they will use it to help market their brand because AI knows exactly what people like and what they want to see and will put together the final product that will succeed the most. Entertainment websites and websites that sell goods maintain and expand their viewers and customers by advertising something new you haven’t seen before when you are done with what you originally visited the website for. A big reason why a company became so successful and became so popular is that they bundled everything people want into a smaller collection, instead of having a much larger bundle that only included a couple items a consumer wants. Virtual reality is giving us a new way to experience the world. You can travel to see your favorite live event anywhere in the world without even having to leave your house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/04/25/top-six-digital-transformation-trends-in-media-and-entertainment/#311c80936729|title=Top Six Digital Transformation Trends In Media And Entertainment|last=Newman|first=Daniel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-bringing-tv-life-digital-video-transformation-strategies|title=Digital Transformation in Media and Entertainment - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples  ==

===== Virtual Reality =====
A three dimensional, computer generated simulation of a real seeming environment brought on by the use of special electronic equipment. This technology is used to replace the user’s entire real world environment with a computer generated (or simulated) one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.Overview.html|title=VIRTUAL REALITY - Overview|website=archive.ncsa.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Augmented Reality   =====
An interactive technology that intertwines computer generated images with real world objects. These artificial images can align with or block the real world environment. This technology is used to alter the user’s perception of the real world which should not to be confused with virtual reality in which the user’s whole perception is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/augmented-reality.html|title=Augmented Reality - definition of Augmented Reality, Meaning of Augmented Reality, BuzzWord from Macmillan Dictionary.|website=www.macmillandictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High Dynamic Range =====
A rich visual and audio experience that provides a greater contrast than standard dynamic range. This technology is most associated with display devices, sound recording, 3D rendering, and photography. Technology like this provides a more lifelike image in the visual aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dynamic-range.htm|title=Understanding Dynamic Range in Digital Photography|website=www.cambridgeincolour.com|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Light Field Devices   =====
A device (usually a camera) that captures information about the light field that is emerging from a real life scene which is; the direction of the light rays in space and the intensity of the light in the actual environment/scene. This technology will someday surpass Virtual Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117075834/http://www.time4.com/time4/microsites/popsci/howitworks/lightfield_camera.html|title=PopSci's How It Works - 100 Megapixel Camera|date=2008-01-17|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Developments ==
Video streaming is becoming a huge part of society in this day and age and it’s only beginning to expand. Video streaming brought in a revenue of $30.29 billion in 2016 and based on projections conducted by Research and Markets, will reach an astonishing $70.05 billion in the year 2021. This projected drastic increase has caused there to be more competition in streaming, which has led to rapid growth, development, and a large increase in the amount of users. Technology is a data based driven field, and with this rapid growth the future is bright for this field. Technology has been enhancing discoveries for as long as it’s been invented. It holds the digital power to entertain, inform, and persuade. Technology will continue to provide all of these sentiments and will continue to do so for as long as developments keep forthcoming. Rapid growth and development does not only affect the consumers, but the producers. Large technology companies will have improve content quality of all while extracting maximum value of the product. Challenges for development in the media industry are how to maximize content, brands, and advertising. While also created tailoring consumers needs to enhance their experience. Consumers drive this field, companies are constantly running data about consumers preferences, relationships, habits, and locations. Technology is a growing field and with companies beginning to care more about the consumers, and with rapid growing development in this field, expect technology to take bigger steps forward in years to come.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/media-and-entertainment-industry-outlook-trends.html|title=2018 Media and Entertainment Industry Trends {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-mission/technology-to-shape-the-future-of-media-entertainment-a1e3acd3b3ac|title=Technology to Shape the Future of Media &amp; Entertainment.|last=DataArt|date=2018-01-09|website=Medium|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Schools that offer programs or degrees in entertainment technology include:

* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Entertainment Technology Center]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etc.cmu.edu/ Entertainment Technology Center].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York City College of Technology]], Department of Entertainment Technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entertainmenttechnology.org/ Entertainment Technology], [[New York City College of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Southern California]], Entertainment Technology Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ Entertainment Technology Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526035103/https://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ |date=2009-05-26 }}, [[University of Southern California]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tshwane University of Technology]], Pretoria, South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tut.ac.za/ Tshwane University of Technology], South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entertainment Technology Training, New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toiwhakaari.ac.nz/study-at-toi-whakaari/entertainment-technology Entertainment Technology Training], New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the only university offering a degree specifically in Entertainment Engineering and Design (EED) is the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).{{fact|date=January 2018}} Because UNLV's program is in its infancy, current entertainment technologists come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds, the most prevalent of which are theater and mechanical technology. Several other institutions of higher education offer similar programs for entertainment-related ventures.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

A bachelor's degree in these areas will typically have a difference of only a few specialized classes.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Traditionally, people interested in careers in this field either presented themselves as apprentices within craft unions, or attended college programs in theatre technology. Although both are appropriate in limited ways, the growing world of entertainment technology encompasses many different types of performance and display environments than the theatre. To this end, newer opportunities have arisen that provide a wider educational base than these more traditional environments. An article "Rethinking Entertainment Technology Education" by John Huntington describes new teaching philosophies that resonate with the need for a richer and more flexible educational environment:&lt;ref name="huntington02"&gt;{{cite journal

{{quote|"We need to bridge the worlds of ivory-tower theatre education with the commercial world of live entertainment production. I believe this bridge would be beneficial not just to the technical students, but to the whole art of performance. When high-tech systems such as video, moving lights, computerized sound, mechanized scenery and show control are mastered by even average entertainment technicians, they can advance the state of their craft, which will allow artists to advance the state of their art."&lt;ref name="huntington02" /&gt;}}

'''Erotic plasticity''' is the degree to which one's [[sex drive]] can be changed by cultural or social factors.&lt;ref name="B2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister |first1=R. F. |year=2000 |title=Gender differences in erotic plasticity: the female sex srive as socially flexible and responsive |url=http://people.fmarion.edu/tbarbeau/Erotic%20Plasticity2000.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=347–74 |pmid=10825779 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.3.347 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105135128/http://people.fmarion.edu/tbarbeau/Erotic%20Plasticity2000.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baumeister |first1=R.

Since social psychologist [[Roy Baumeister]] coined the term in 2000, only two studies directly assessing erotic plasticity have been completed {{as of|2010|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Benuto"&gt;Benuto, L. (2010). ''Exploring erotic plasticity as an individual difference variable: Theory and measurement. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering,'' 7263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BenutoMeana"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benuto | first1 = L. | last2 = Meana | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Acculturation and sexuality: investigating gender differences in erotic plasticity | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 217–24 | pmid = 18686150 | doi=10.1080/00224490801987465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[#Female erotic plasticity hypothesis|female erotic plasticity hypothesis]] states that women have higher erotic plasticity than men, and therefore their sex drives are more socially flexible and responsive than those of men (factors such as religion, culture and education have a greater effect on women's sexual behaviors). Men, on the other hand, remain relatively rigid after [[puberty]] but can still be affected by these factors.

==Female erotic plasticity hypothesis==
As women have been theorised to possess a weaker sex drive than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister |first1=R. F. |last2=Catanese |first2=K. R. |last3=Vohs |first3=K. D. |year=2001 |title=Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

A. | year = 2009 | title = Sex differences in sex drive, sociosexuality, and height across 53 nations: testing evolutionary and social structural theories | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 631–51 | pmid = 17975724 | doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; they may more readily accept substitutes or alternate forms of satisfaction. Baumeister theorized that weaker motivations tend to lead to greater plasticity. For example, the [[Father|paternal]] role has greater plasticity than the [[mother|maternal]] role because males have a weaker motivation in the parenting context.&lt;ref name="B2004" /&gt; However, a lower sex drive does not necessarily imply that sex is less important for women, or that females have a lower capacity to become aroused. Rather, Baumeister's hypothesis&lt;ref name="B2004" /&gt; supports the notion that women are less willing to engage in sex than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = L. M. | year = 2007 | title = The evolution of Plasticity in Female-Female Desire | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 245–274 | doi=10.1300/j056v18n04_01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence for female erotic plasticity===

====Culture====
According to Baumeister, the culture a woman is raised in affects her sexual attitudes and behaviours more than it would affect a man raised in the same culture. Factors such as politics, cultural and societal views on sexual behaviours would all play a role. A multinational study by Lippa (2009) found that women are more variable in their sex drives, suggesting that their sexuality is more malleable and influenced by society than men's.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2009" /&gt; Another study showed that South Korean women had a higher median age of first intercourse, lower rates of premarital sex, and greater disapproval of premarital sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sohn | first1 = A. | last2 = Chun | first2 = S. S. | year = 2007 | title = Gender Differences in Sexual Behaviour and Condom-Related Behaviours and Attitudes among Korean Youths | url = | journal = Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 45–52 | doi=10.1177/10105395070190020801}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Korea, there are strong gender-based sexual [[double standard]]s such that women are expected to be passive and virgins at marriage. Therefore, Baumeister theorized that cultural norms have affected women's attitudes and behaviours more so than men. Another study showed that female, but not male, Hispanic immigrants to the United States were less likely to engage in vaginal, oral, and anal sex than Hispanics who had been born and raised in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = U. K. | last2 = Tillman | first2 = K. H. | year = 2009 | title = Risky Sexual Behaviours Among Hispanic Young Adults in South Florida: Nativity, Age at Immigration And Gender Differences | url = | journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 202–209 | doi=10.1363/4120209}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Safe sex|Condom use]] was unaffected by whether or not the person was an immigrant, suggesting that upbringing and acculturation had a significant impact on engaging in sexual activity and not on how they would protect themselves during sex.

Baumeister predicted that [[acculturation]], the process of adopting the behaviour patterns and attitudes of the surrounding culture, should have a greater effect on the sexual behaviours and attitudes of female immigrants. However, in a study conducted by Benuto and Meana, one of the two studies conducted about erotic plasticity, supporting evidence was not found.&lt;ref name="BenutoMeana" /&gt; When examining the acculturation of college students from an American college of non-American background, acculturation had the same effect on sexual behaviours and attitudes of both men and women. Numerous potential methodological flaws of the study are indicated that may have produced this contradictory data, such as women trying to appear socially desirable in their responses (see [[social desirability bias]]) or that participants were too acculturated.

====Religion====
Catholic nuns are more successful at fulfilling their vows of [[celibacy]] and more willing to commit to their promises of sexual abstinence than male clergy, suggesting women can more easily adapt to such high non-permissive standards.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, S. (1992). ''A delicate dance: Sexuality, celibacy, and relationships among Catholic clergy and religious.'' New York: Crossroad.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on older unmarried adults found that those who were highly religious were less likely to have recently had sex compared to non-religious unmarried adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Uecker | first2 = J. E. | last3 = Regnerus | first3 = M. D. | year = 2011 | title = The Role of Religion in Shaping Sexual Frequency and Satisfaction: Evidence from Married and Unmarried Older Adults | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 48 | issue = 2–3| pages = 297–308 | doi=10.1080/00224491003739993| pmc = 3119480 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this effect was stronger in women, suggesting a stronger influence on women's sexual behaviour. Church attendance and religiosity is also associated with lower odds of reporting masturbation among females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baćak | first1 = V. | last2 = Štulhofer | first2 = A. | year = 2011 | title = Masturbation Among Sexually Active Women in Croatia: Associations with Religiosity and Pornography Use | url = | journal = International Journal of Sexual Health | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 248–257 | doi=10.1080/19317611.2011.611220}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible explanation is that higher levels of spirituality and religiosity are associated with higher levels of sex guilt in women. One study even suggests that this differs amongst women of different culture. Religious Euro-Canadian women reported significantly higher levels of sexual desire and less sex guilt than Eastern Asian women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woo | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Morshedian | first2 = N. | last3 = Brotto | first3 = L. A. | last4 = Gorzalka | first4 = B. B. | year = 2012 | title = Sex Guilt Mediates the Relationship Between Religiosity and Sexual Desire in East Asian and Euro-Canadian College Aged Women | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 41 | issue = | page = 1485 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-012-9918-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of two societal pressures, religion and culture, interacting to shape sexuality. Finally, Farmer and colleagues (2009) found that unreligious women are more likely to engage in unrestricted premarital intercourse behaviour than religious women. Such a difference was not demonstrated in religious and non-religious men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farmer | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Trapnell | first2 = P.

=====Adolescent sexuality=====
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality|Premarital sex|Sexual abstinence}}

Religiosity can also affect whether adolescents choose to abstain from sexual conduct. Commitment to religion and having friends with similar commitments has a stronger impact on girls than boys.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmer-Gembeck | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Helfand | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Ten years of longitudinal research on U.S. adolescent sexual behaviour: Development correlates of sexual intercourse, and the importance of age, gender and ethnic background | url = | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 153–224 | doi=10.1016/j.dr.2007.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors, such as family members’ disapproval of adolescent sexual behaviour also play a significant role.

====Heritability====
[[Heritability]] is the amount of differences between individuals that is the product of genetics. According to female erotic plasticity theory, sexual behaviours of men should be more heritable because there is a stronger biological component driving these behaviours. A study examining adult twins in Sweden found a lower genetic component for the engagement in same-sex behaviours in women than in men.&lt;ref name="Langstrom"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Långström | first1 = N. | last2 = Rahman | first2 = Q. | last3 = Carlström | first3 = E. | last4 = Lichtenstein | first4 = P. | year = 2010 | title = Genetic and Environmental Effects on Same-sex Sexual Behaviour: A Population Study of Twins in Sweden | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9386-1 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 75–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared environment also played a larger role in women's same-sex behaviours than in men's, although unique environmental factors were roughly the same. On the other hand, in their study of Australian twins, Bailey, Dunne and Martin found a concordance in sexual behaviour of 20% for male [[Twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|MZ twins]], and of 24% for female MZ twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bailey, J. Michael |author2=Dunne, Michael P. |author3=Martin, Nicholas G. |date=March 2000|title=Genetic and environmental influences on sexual orientation and its correlates in an Australian twin sample.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=78|pages=524–536|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/78/3/524/|accessdate=2013-03-05|issue=3|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.3.524|pmid=10743878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another twin study showed male identical twins are more likely than female identical twins to begin having sex at the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunne | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Martin | first2 = N. G. | last3 = Statham | first3 = D. J. | last4 = Slutske | first4 = W. S. | last5 = Dinwiddie | first5 = S. H. | last6 = Bucholz | first6 = K.

====Attitude–behaviour inconsistencies====
Baumeister's 3rd prediction states that women should have greater inconsistencies between their attitudes towards sexual behaviours and whether they actually engage in said behaviours. Wives are more likely than husbands to report that they changed a "great deal" in their habits, ideas and expectations of sex over 20 years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ard | first1 = B. N. | year = 1977 | title = Sex in Lasting Marriages: A Longitudinal Study | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 274–285 | doi=10.1080/00224497709550985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more husbands reported that their spouses changed than did wives. Another example is condom use, for which women in the past have demonstrated difficulty in expressing their desire to use them during sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Bird | first2 = S. T. | last3 = Henderson | first3 = J. T. | last4 = Beckman | first4 = L. J. | last5 = Huszti | first5 = H.

==Gender similarities==
Although the female erotic plasticity theory states that the men's and women's sexuality are different, some evidence suggests that men's sexuality too can be affected by sociocultural factors. Although religious commitment and family member's stances on adolescent sexual behaviours have a significant impact on females' choice to abstain, to a lesser extent it affects males' choice as well.&lt;ref name="Zimmer" /&gt; Also, the fact that some male clergy are successful in maintaining their vows of celibacy suggests some degree of erotic plasticity. College education is associated with an increase in variety of sexual behaviours&lt;ref name="SH-D"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shibley Hyde | first1 = J. | last2 = Durik | first2 = A. M. | year = 2000 | title = Gender Differences in Erotic Plasticity – Evolutionary or Sociocultural Forces?

Asian males and females consistently report more conservative sexual attitudes than Hispanic and Euro-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahrold | first1 = T. K. | last2 = Meston | first2 = C. M. | year = 2010 | title = Ethnic Differences in Sexual Attitudes of U.S. College Students: Gender, Acculturation, and Religiosity Factors | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9406-1 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 190–202 | pmc = 4426857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual arousal==
{{Main article|Sexual arousal}}

According to [[Meredith Chivers]], straight women are physically aroused by a greater variety of erotic images than men, and this physical arousal does not match subjective arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chivers | first1 = M. L. | year = 2010 | title = A brief update on the specificity of sexual arousal | url = | journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 407–414 | doi=10.1080/14681994.2010.495979}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar results were found in a study that showed both consensual and non-consensual sex scenes to men and women. Neither men nor women reported sexual arousal to the rape scenes, but women's bodies responded in a similar way to both scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kelly D. Suschinsky |author2=Martin L. Lalumière |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/2/159.short |title=Prepared for Anything? |doi=10.1177/0956797610394660 |date=2010-12-28 |accessdate=2013-03-05 |volume=22 |journal=Psychological Science |pages=159–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual explanation for this is that women's physical arousal is an evolutionary automatic response, to prevent damage during rape.
However, a study that measured sexual arousal through pupil dilation found that physical response of lesbian and bisexual women to erotic images was more category-specific, with lesbian women showing more response to women, and bisexual women showing more response to the preferred sex than the other. This may be due to masculinization of the brain via prenatal hormones. The difference between straight and non-straight women was consistent with Chivers' findings.
The same study found also sexual fluidity in men's response, that moved along a continuum between heterosexuality and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0040256 |title=The Eyes Have It: Sex and Sexual Orientation Differences in Pupil Dilation Patterns |publisher=PLoS ONE |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study by Henry E. Adams et al. showed that a significant percentage of heterosexual men, both homophobic (80%) and non-homophobic (34%), became aroused by homosexual male pornography, as well as heterosexual and lesbian, suggesting that sexual arousal in men is also fluid.&lt;ref name="my.psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://my.psychologytoday.com/files/u47/Henry_et_al.pdf |title=Is Homophobia Associated With Homosexual Arousal? |publisher=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |year=1996 |author1=Henry E. Adams |author2=Lester W. Wright, Jr. |author3=Bethany A. Lohr |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual fluidity and same-sex behaviours==
[[Sexual fluidity]] is the concept that sexual orientation or sexuality is not rigid, but rather can change over time. According to Lisa Diamond, developer of the concept, women generally tend to be more fluid in their sexuality than men.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, L. M. (2008). ''Sexual Fluidity: Understanding Women’s Love and Desire.'' Cambridge: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In her study of lesbian, bisexual and unlabeled women, she found that these had a tendency of changing their sexual identities and behaviour over time.&lt;ref name="my.psychologytoday.com"/&gt; 
Other studies have shown as well greater fluidity among lesbians, compared with homosexual men. However, heterosexual men and women were equally stable in their orientation, and bisexual men and women were similarly unstable.&lt;ref&gt;http://midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1153.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Kinsey proposed that sexuality moves along a continuum, and it's not reduced to two extremes. In his studies he found substantial same-sex behaviour among the general population: 46% of men had reacted sexually to persons of both sexes during the course of their lives, while 36% of men and 13% of women had an overt homosexual experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'', {{ISBN|978-0-253-33412-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]]; [[Wardell Pomeroy|Pomeroy, W.]]; [[Clyde Martin|Martin, C.]], &amp; [[Paul Gebhard|Gebhard, P.]] ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', Philadelphia: Saunders (1953), {{ISBN|978-0-253-33411-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who remained in relationships with [[Trans woman|male-to-female]] [[Transsexualism|transsexuals]] maintained a heterosexual identity, yet reported changes in their sexual lives. (Aramburu Alegría, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;Aramburu Alegría, C. (2012). Relational and sexual fluidity in females partnered with male-to-female transsexual persons. ''Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, 2012 Feb 1,'' 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; Some women reported that their relationships no longer included sexual activity, while others reported that things were still changing. This suggests women are able to change their sexuality without changing their sexual orientation.
Also, according to Lippa (2006), heterosexual women with high sex drives tend to be attracted to both women and men, whereas heterosexual men with high sex drives are only associated with attraction to either women or men, suggesting greater plasticity in women's sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R. A. | year = 2006 | title = Is High Sex Drive Associated With Increased Sexual Attraction to Both Sexes? It Depends on Whether You Are Male or Female | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 46–52 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although, according to Van Wyk and Geist (1984) and Dixon (1985), a high sex drive is also associated with bisexuality in men.

==Erotic plasticity and gender/sexual variation==
Lesbians are more likely than gay men to engage in heterosexual sex, suggesting greater variability in their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F. &amp; Stillman, T. (2006). Erotic Plasticity: Nature, Culture, Gender, and Sexuality. In R. D. McAnulty &amp; M. M Burnette (Eds.), ''Sex and Sexuality, Volume 1'' (pp. 343-359). Westport: Praeger Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bart, P. B. (1993). Protean women: The liquidity of female sexuality and the tenaciousness of lesbian identity. In S. Wilkinson &amp; C. Kitzinger (Eds.), ''Heterosexuality: Feminism and psychology reader'' (pp. 246-252). London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; No research has been done on people with gender variation, such as [[transgender]] people.

Little is known about erotic plasticity in [[Transsexualism|transsexuals]]. [[Sexual reassignment surgery]] and [[hormone therapy]] (i.e. [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]]) in [[Trans man|female-to-male transsexuals]] produce an increase in their sexual desire, but it is uncertain how erotic plasticity plays a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wierckx | first1 = K. | last2 = Elaut | first2 = E. | last3 = Van Caenegem | first3 = E. V. | last4 = Van De Peer | first4 = F. | last5 = Dedecker | first5 = D. | last6 = Van Houdenhove | first6 = E.

L. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = J. M. | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation of female-to-male transsexuals: A comparison of homosexual and non-homosexual types | doi = 10.1023/a:1001915530479 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 259–278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Erotic Plasticity Questionnaire''==
In her Ph.D. dissertation in 2009, [[Lorraine Benuto]] attempted to create a scale measuring erotic plasticity.&lt;ref name="Benuto" /&gt; Her scale, the EPQ (''Erotic Plasticity Questionnaire''), contained the following subscales, each believed to be a component of erotic plasticity:
* Fluidity (of behaviours on the same-sex/opposite-sex continuum)
* Attitude-Behaviour Inconsistency
* Changes in Attitudes (over time)
* Perception of Choice
* Sociocultural Influence

When administered to a test population, women scored higher on fluidity, attitude-behaviour inconsistency, and overall erotic plasticity. There were no significant gender differences in changes in attitudes, perception of choice and sociocultural influences. The test also did not demonstrate any relationship between erotic plasticity and locus of control, sexual liberality and openness. Benuto also did not find a negative correlation between sex drive and EPQ score, which is unexpected. This is either because of a methodological problem in the scale or a problem in Baumeister's hypothesis that plasticity is related to sex drive. Furthermore, the subscales of the EPQ did not correlate well with each other, leading Benuto to hypothesize that perhaps there is not just one type of plasticity, but plasticities, and erotic plasticity is a much more complicated construct than initially imagined.

Contrary to the numerous studies Baumeister cites as evidence of sociocultural influences on women, Benuto did not find a gender difference on the sociocultural influence subscale. However, Baumeister's cited studies were not [[self-report study|self-report studies]], whereas Benuto's scale was, which may have contributed to the discrepancy.

==Applications in sex therapy==
Baumeister provided three applications of the theory of erotic plasticity in [[sex therapy]].&lt;ref name="B2004" /&gt; Sex differences in erotic plasticity can change how therapists will approach providing sex therapy to men and women. Baumeister found that [[cognitive therapy]] would be a better approach for female patients because sexual responses and behaviours are influenced by what things mean, therefore working with women's interpretations and understanding of these responses and behaviours would be of greatest benefit. Physiological therapy, such as [[hormone therapy]], would therefore be best for male patients, since the focus would be more on the body than on the man's cognitions. Also, someone with high erotic plasticity will have less sexual self-knowledge and self-understanding than someone with low erotic plasticity since their behaviours and tastes are susceptible to change; this knowledge could be useful in helping someone perhaps confused about his or her sexual identity. Finally, prospects for successful sex therapy may be better for women than men, because if men develop a problem, their low plasticity will make it difficult to allow significant change after puberty.

Other useful applications of erotic plasticity in sex therapy include having women place much consideration in family and peer relationships, and any internal and external pressures that may be affecting their sexual identity, such as religious influences, cultural norms and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McElwain | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Grimes | first2 = M. E. | last3 = McVicker | first3 = M. L. | year = 2009 | title = The Implications of Erotic Plasticity and [[Social Constructionism]] in the Formation of Female Sexual Identity | url = | journal = Journal of Feminist Family Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 125–139 | doi=10.1080/08952830902911347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and alternate explanations==
Baumeister's theory of female erotic plasticity has been met with some criticism. Some argue Baumeister makes causal inferences from correlational research when discussing how education affects men and women differently.&lt;ref name="SH-D" /&gt; He was also criticized for his use of extreme groups to support his predictions, such as people of the least and most amount of education.&lt;ref name="SH-D" /&gt; Below are two posited alternate explanations of erotic plasticity:

===Shibley Hyde and Durik===
In a 2000 paper, [[Janet Shibley Hyde]] and Amanda M. Durik argued that a more sociocultural explanation could be used to explain erotic plasticity.&lt;ref name="Hyde &amp; Durik, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=Janet Shibley|author2=Durik, Amanda M.|title=Gender Differences in Erotic Plasticity – Evolkutionary or Sociocultural Forces? Comment on Baumeister (2000)|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2000|volume=126|issue=3|pages=375–379|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.3.375|pmid=10825780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, education does not affect men's and women's sexual behaviour differently. Instead, it increases women's power, therefore women with the greatest amount of education are nearly equal in power with men. On the other hand, women who are the least educated have the least power relative to men. When comparing sexual behaviours of most educated and least educated men and women, they found that education actually increased the prevalence of many sexual activities in both sexes, including oral sex, anal sex, and having a same sex partner. The differences between men and women were much smaller in the most educated group than in the least educated group. Shibley Hyde and Durik speculate that more educated women are better at communicating their desires and have enough self-confidence to do so. They also may perform a greater variety of sexual activities because of their greater exposure to ideas and their commitment to learning.

Shibley Hyde and Durik also asserted that religion has a greater effect on women's sexual behaviours because a group with less power – in this case, women – will shape their behaviour to be more like the group with power, in this case, men. Therefore, women pay more attention to and conform more to religious teachings since it is the culture to which they must adapt. They back up this claim by presenting evidence that non-religious women and men are similar in the prevalence of all sexual activities, minus masturbation. On the contrary, Conservative Protestant men and women differed significantly in all sexual behaviours.

They also argued for a modern sexual double standard that is more restrictive of female sexuality than male sexuality. They claimed that now, extramarital sex is more tolerated in women than in the past, but it is still less acceptable in women than in men. Therefore, these different gender roles will exert powerful influences on both men's and women's behaviour and sexuality. Finally, they claim that the greater evidence for attitude-behaviour inconsistency in women is not the result of high erotic plasticity, but because of men's greater interpersonal power. Although women may, for example, have the intention of using condoms or have negative attitudes towards anal sex, men may use their greater power to do what it is they desire if it differs from what their partner wants.

===Benuto===
Benuto (2009) argues that heightened fluidity and sociocultural influences, two components of erotic plasticity, actually stand in opposition to each other. Although scientific evidence exists that women's sexual behaviours are indeed more fluid than men's, Benuto argues there is nothing in society that would encourage women to engage in same-sex behaviour. She hypothesizes that, based on the properties of her EPQ scale (Benuto, 2009),&lt;ref name="Benuto" /&gt; erotic plasticity may not be a unitary construct like Baumeister initially proposed, and that there perhaps may be multiple “plasticities”, each composed of different constructs. Such constructs include sociocultural influences, [[locus of control]] and changes of sexual attitudes over time. Finally, it is possible that the heightened attitude-behaviour inconsistency in women could either be due to the powerlessness of women, or women wanting to maintain harmony and nurturance in their relationship.

===The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce===

The issue of divorce is a crucial aspect in the society in relations to the life of children. The separation of a married couple due to irreconcilable differences is a matter that is common in the society and its effects on children is negative. It will impact negatively on the education of the children, health conditions of the children, children's relation with their parents as well as the future well-being of the children (Amato, 2000). Therefore, the area relating to the effects of divorce on children is significant for academic inquiry. It makes sense to research on this particular area since it will help learn on the effects that comes with divorce, how children adjust and adapt to divorce and how they are being treated.  It is also worth to mention that, parents who divorce have their minds lingering on how their actions will affect their children's happiness as well as health.

====A review of how the study is to be conducted====

In attempting to explain how divorce will affect children, it is necessary for a research to first examine and categorize children in groups which will make it easy to carry out the study. This is because children will be affected differently by divorce depending on the age factor. It becomes even wise for a researcher to adopt the following groups: pre-schoolers (nine years and below), adolescents (9–13 years) and youths/young adults (14–25 years). The research will become more attainable if carried out using learning institutions which will include pre-schools, secondary schools and colleges. Therefore, a city within a state is selected where the research will be conducted and a preschool, one secondary school and one college is selected within the city where respondents (children) are found.
Objectives becomes necessary for the study. This will allow a research to focus on certain areas and completely address the matter at hand without leaving gaps in the area of research. In addressing the topic, ‘The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce,’ the following research objectives can be used:
*To examine ways in which pre-schoolers are affected by absence of parent following divorce.
*To examine ways in which adolescents are affected by absence of parent following divorce.
*To examine ways in which young adults are affected by absence of parent following divorce.
*To examine ways of reducing effects of absence of parent following divorce on children.
Research questions are also vital in this study. They offer guidelines on realizing the objectives of the study. At the conclusion, a researcher will review the research questions and establish whether they have been answered or not. The topic under study here will encompass the following research questions:
*How does absence of parent following divorce affect pre-schoolers?
*How does absence of parent following divorce affect adolescence?
*How does absence of parent following divorce affect young adults?
*How can effects of absence of parent following divorce be reduced?
It is also necessary that significance of the study be stated by a researcher which will make the research meaningful. In line with this topic, parents will be informed of the underlying behaviours of children as a result of absence of parent following divorce. The study will also enlighten parents on the roles they play to shape their children when they live as a couple, therefore, parents will try to their best to reconcile their differences and live as one. The challenges that young adults at the age of 14 to 25 years and whose parents divorced faces as they enter into romantic relationships are revealed. The aim of the study is to explore knowledge relating to counselling of such cases.
The study will be easier when the scope is mentioned. This is the area the study will cover or rather the number of respondents. The study on ‘The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce,’ will be focus on pre-schoolers, adolescents as well as young adults in a particular area which can be certain learning institutions within a specific city. There are also certain assumptions which a researcher will have to make in this study. For example, it will be assumed that at the time the research will be done. All the learning institutions will be on session and can be accessed and that the respondents will be willing to share the information required.

As part of the research, a literature review is necessary. This will involve carrying out various theoretical reviews to examine various theories related to the topic under study. Such theories will include attachment theory, social learning theory, among many others. The theories will lay a foundation to the topic. Moreover, empirical review is another part of literature review where various literary works carried out by other researchers relating to the topic of study are examined in detail.

Research methodology will consist of the research design suitable for the topic of study, the target population, the sampling design, data collection and data analysis.  The research design in relation to the topic of this study will be descriptive survey design. The target population will consist of all the students in the learning institutions selected that will be used for the research. Stratified sampling design is suitable for the study since data will be collected and based on three strata; pre-schoolers, secondary and college. Data collection will be by use of questionnaires and finally, data analysis will be both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative will encompass such descriptive statistics as mean and standard deviation while the qualitative will take into account attaching significance to the themes as well as the patterns observed (Bryman, 2008).
The results and findings will be finally presented summarizing the information obtained from data collection and analysed. The summary of the findings will provide answers to the research questions, reveal the challenges experienced throughout the research and expose gabs that can aid in further research concerning the topic.
The research especially when administering questionnaires and interviews if any should be carried out in a manner which is within two key aspects: conforming to ethical practices and adhering to approved protocol. Ethical practices in research are very vital and plays a very important role in protecting the rights and privacy of the respondents. The use of human subjects is a critical ethical consideration. This study will have to adhere to the guidelines set by Institutional Review Board of the schools which data will be collected.  The board is composed of people who will check to ensure that the information gathered from the respondents are safe and that human rights of the respondents are not violated in any case. The ethical considerations that are relevant to this study will involve voluntary participation by the respondents and the informed consent (Vanclay, 2013).
It is important to note that ethical standards very important roles in this research work. They guarantee that all human subjects that become respondents in the study accepted freely and willfully to participate and that they have been fully updated on the purpose of the research. Moreover, the subjects’ confidentiality and anonymity is highly protected.&lt;ref&gt;Amato, P.R. (2000). The consequences of divorce for adults and children.

=== Behavioural and mental health difficulties ===
In regard to the effects of father absence, a recent British study&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; assessed child problem behaviour in over 15,000 families using the clinical cut-offs of the [[Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire|Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]], controlling for household factors such as resources, parental mental health and inter-parental relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fomby|first=Paula|last2=Osborne|first2=Cynthia|date=2010-11-01|title=The influence of union instability and union quality on children’s aggressive behavior|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X10000116|journal=Social Science Research|volume=39|issue=6|pages=912–924|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.02.006|pmc=3302180|pmid=22423167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Julia S.|last2=Carlson|first2=Marcia J.|date=2014-08-01|title=Parents' Relationship Quality and Children's Behavior in Stable Married and Cohabiting Families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12120/abstract|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|language=en|volume=76|issue=4|pages=762–777|doi=10.1111/jomf.12120|issn=1741-3737|pmc=4128411|pmid=25125703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that father absence at a given age, similar to poverty and parental psychological distress, predicted a high probability of the child scoring above the cut-off score for total difficulties two years later. Likewise, father absence predicted several specific difficulties including [[borderline personality disorder]], severe [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|hyperactivity]] and abnormal emotional problems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Reciprocally, a child's severe externalising and social during their preschool years were also associated with a greater probability of the father being absent two years later. The authors concluded that father absence seemed to be more of a cause than a consequence of child problem behaviour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Through direct interaction, fathers’ involvement in children's development has a positive influence on their social, behavioural and psychological outcomes. In general, engagement of a fatherly figure reduces the frequency of behavioural problems and [[juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] in sons and psychological problems in daughters, all the while facilitating children's [[cognitive development]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarkadi|first=Anna|last2=Kristiansson|first2=Robert|last3=Oberklaid|first3=Frank|last4=Bremberg|first4=Sven|date=2008-02-01|title=Fathers' involvement and children's developmental outcomes: a systematic review of longitudinal studies|journal=Acta Paediatrica|volume=97|issue=2|pages=153–158|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00572.x|issn=0803-5253|pmid=18052995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=East|first=Leah|last2=Jackson|first2=Debra|last3=O'Brien|first3=Louise|date=2006-12-01|title=Father absence and adolescent development: a review of the literature|url=http://chc.sagepub.com/content/10/4/283|journal=Journal of Child Health Care|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=283–295|doi=10.1177/1367493506067869|issn=1367-4935|pmid=17101621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches ==

=== Evolutionary approach ===
[[Life history theory|Evolutionary life-history theory]] postulates that women may [[Parental investment|invest]] more in their offspring than the opposite gender due to a slower rate of reproduction in females.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. (1972). [http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf Parental investment and sexual selection]. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual selection and the descent of man'' (pp. 136-179). London: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists add that the assured maternal relatedness to one's offspring may also make women invest more than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=R. D.|date=1974-01-01|title=The Evolution of Social Behavior|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.es.05.110174.001545|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=5|issue=1|pages=325–383|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.05.110174.001545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Kermyt G.|last2=Kaplan|first2=Hillard|last3=Lancaster|first3=Jane B.|title=Confidence of paternity, divorce, and investment in children by Albuquerque men|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513806000705|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because some men may have variable paternity confidence that the child is his offspring. In light of this, some researchers argue that assured maternal relatedness, together with the lower variance in female [[reproductive success]], may lead parents to bias investment towards female offspring under less favourable household conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|last2=Willard|first2=Dan E.|date=1973-01-05|title=Natural Selection of Parental Ability to Vary the Sex Ratio of Offspring|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/179/4068/90|journal=Science|language=en|volume=179|issue=4068|pages=90–92|doi=10.1126/science.179.4068.90|issn=0036-8075|pmid=4682135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, father absence and the associated socioeconomic constraints it puts on the household may pose a greater risk to sons’ rather than daughters’ survival.

=== Psychodynamic approach ===
The [[psychodynamic approach]] posits that behaviour is motivated by [[basic needs]], and [[Drive theory|drives]] and is sometimes shaped by [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] childhood experiences. It is implicated that for a child to develop a “normal” gender identity, they will have to be raised in a conventional family where there is a father and a mother. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] believed that being parented by a single mother could confuse the child's identity or lead them to become [[Homosexuality|homosexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The psychoanalytic theory of male homosexuality|last=Kenneth|first=Lewes|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1988|isbn=0671623915|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father absence may hinder the son's acquisition of the traditional masculine role, as he is not able to model his own behaviour and attitude on his fathers’. Along similar lines, sons with absent fathers could have confused gender identities – if the son was separated from his father by age four, he would be less assertive, less involved in sport, less masculine than other boys and more dependent on his peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HETHERINGTON|first=E. MAVIS|last2=DEUR|first2=JAN L.|date=1971-01-01|title=The Effects of Father Absence on Child Development|jstor=42643357|journal=Young Children|volume=26|issue=4|pages=233–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, findings of certain empirical studies on psychosexual gender identification have been deemed contradictory and inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golombok|first=S.|last2=Rust|first2=J.|date=1986-12-01|title=The Warnock Report and single women: what about the children?|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|volume=12|issue=4|pages=182–186|issn=0306-6800|pmc=1375380|pmid=3806629|doi=10.1136/jme.12.4.182}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have highlighted such negative consequences of the two-parent heterosexual household on children. Contrarily, others have pointed out that being reared in [[lesbian]] and single-parent households where the father was absent did not affect the psychosexual development of children, despite higher aggressiveness and submissiveness and lower assertiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golombok|first=Susan|last2=Spencer|first2=Ann|last3=Rutter|first3=Michael|date=1983-10-01|title=Children in Lesbian and Single-Parent Households: Psychosexual and Psychiatric Appraisal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1983.tb00132.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=551–572|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1983.tb00132.x|issn=1469-7610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological approach ===
Genes and hormones may account for the tendency of fathers to be absent. Certain DNA patterns have been shown to affect an individual's degree of [[fidelity]] and investment in their offspring. In particular, a study in [[prairie vole]]s indicates that the gene [[Arginine vasopressin receptor 1A|AVPR1A]] affects the activity of [[vasopressin]] receptors in brain regions and thus predicts less cheating on their partners.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okhovat|first=Mariam|last2=Berrio|first2=Alejandro|last3=Wallace|first3=Gerard|last4=Ophir|first4=Alexander G.|last5=Phelps|first5=Steven M.|date=2015-12-11|title=Sexual fidelity trade-offs promote regulatory variation in the prairie vole brain|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1371|journal=Science|language=en|volume=350|issue=6266|pages=1371–1374|doi=10.1126/science.aac5791|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26659055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[oxytocin]], the hormone vasopressin can facilitate trust, empathy and social bonding. Injection of vasopressin in [[Polygamy|polygamous]] [[montane vole]]s significantly increased their likelihood of becoming [[Monogamy|monogamous]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This may in turn decrease their likelihood of being an absent father.

A meta-analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klahr|first=Ashlea M.|last2=Burt|first2=S. Alexandra|title=Elucidating the etiology of individual differences in parenting: A meta-analysis of behavioral genetic research.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0034205|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=140|issue=2|pages=544–586|doi=10.1037/a0034205|pmid=24016230}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on 56 [[Twin study|twin]] and [[Adoption study|adoption studies]] totalling over 200,000 families has revealed that genetic makeup significantly affects the individual's parenting behaviour. Genes in the father reliability predict up to 40% of his positive or negative emotions towards his children. In this sense, genes contribute to a father's liking or repulsion for his children, the latter of which may result in father absence.

== Gender differences ==
There is mixed empirical evidence on the relative impact of father absence on the development of male and female offspring. A recent study in rural [[Ethiopia]], where father absence could mean a significant drop in household income, revealed a considerable difference between the wellbeing of male and female offspring.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Mhairi A.|date=2008-07-22|title=Does Investment in the Sexes Differ When Fathers Are Absent?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-008-9044-2|journal=Human Nature|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=263–276|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9044-2|issn=1045-6767}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the author found that a male infant's risk of dying per month was doubled if the biological father was absent – a 30% greater risk than that for females. For female infants, father absence (as opposed to presence) was associated with a lower risk of dying, as well as higher nutritional status. That is to say, father absence was only a statistical predictor of infant death only for male infants. Such a gender difference has been observed despite a strong [[Son preference|cultural preference for sons]] in the area. On the other hand, in developed countries such as the United Kingdom where father absence may not inflict as much harm on the family's income, the effects of father absence are not noticeably gendered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

An early menarche can increase the chance of [[fertility]], while other short-term reproductive strategies can diversify the genes inherited in offspring. These could lift up a higher success rate of rearing children to adolescence. Moreover, the stress of father absence prompts girls to develop a variety of internalising disorders, such as [[bulimia]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], which may lower the person's [[metabolism]] leading to excessive weight gain which  precipitates early menarche.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplowitz|first=Paul B.|date=2008-02-01|title=Link Between Body Fat and the Timing of Puberty|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/Supplement_3/S208|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=121|issue=Supplement 3|pages=S208–S217|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-1813F|issn=0031-4005|pmid=18245513}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study shows that there are fewer monitored meals in the father-absent household.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Videon|first=Tami M|last2=Manning|first2=Carolyn K|title=Influences on adolescent eating patterns: the importance of family meals|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1054139X02007115|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=32|issue=5|pages=365–373|doi=10.1016/s1054-139x(02)00711-5|pmid=12729986|date=May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having meals in the family is arguably more beneficial to children than is eating alone (i.e. solitary eating), as the former lowers the chance of [[obesity]].

However, it has been disputed whether the environmental stress of father absence stimulates weight gain, and thus accelerates early puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moffitt|first=Terrie E.|last2=Caspi|first2=Avshalom|last3=Belsky|first3=Jay|last4=Silva|first4=Phil A.|date=1992-01-01|title=Childhood Experience and the Onset of Menarche: A Test of a Sociobiological Model|jstor=1130900|journal=Child Development|volume=63|issue=1|pages=47–58|doi=10.2307/1130900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogaert|first=Anthony F.|date=2008-07-01|title=MENARCHE AND FATHER ABSENCE IN A NATIONAL PROBABILITY SAMPLE|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0021932007002386|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|volume=40|issue=04|pages=623–636|doi=10.1017/S0021932007002386|issn=1469-7599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the stress arisen from the absence of mother has been shown to have little influence on the child's body weight. Since mother absence does not predict weight gain in children, it seems that the increase in the child's body weight observed is due to the isolated genetic influence of an absent father, rather than the global environmental stress cause by the absence of either parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=W.|last2=Zhao|first2=L.-J.|last3=Liu|first3=Y.-Z.|last4=Recker|first4=R.

A specialised mechanism to deal with mother absence has never been developed.

In addition, recent findings seem to regard genes, rather than the environment, as the mechanism underlying the positive correlation between high [[body mass index]] and earlier first menarche onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Family composition, stress, and the timing of human menarche.

=== Sexual behaviour ===

Father absence in a household can result in children (of both sexes) having earlier average ages of first sexual intercourse than those raised in father present households. There is also the effect of increased rates of teenage [[pregnancy]]. Some evolutionary theories propose that early childhood is vital for encoding information that shapes future reproductive strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belsky|first=Jay|last2=Steinberg|first2=Laurence D.|last3=Houts|first3=Renate M.|last4=Friedman|first4=Sarah L.|last5=DeHart|first5=Ganie|last6=Cauffman|first6=Elizabeth|last7=Roisman|first7=Glenn I.|last8=Halpern-Felsher|first8=Bonnie L.|last9=Susman|first9=Elisabeth|date=2007-08-01|title=Family rearing antecedents of pubertal timing|journal=Child Development|volume=78|issue=4|pages=1302–1321|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01067.x|issn=0009-3920|pmid=17650140}}&lt;/ref&gt; in regulating physical and motivational pathways of sexual behaviour. Conflicting and stressful parental relationships can lead children to believe that resources are limited, people are untrustworthy, and relationships are opportunistic. As they replicate their parents’ mating-oriented reproductive behaviour, they tend to have multiple sexual partners and erratic relationships. Children implicitly and explicitly model their sexual attitudes and behaviours on their parents, see engagement in non-marital sex as normative. Father absence however can be a byproduct of initial social and economic strain within the household (e.g. violence, lack of educational opportunities and cumulative life exposure to poverty can increase the likelihood of early sexual endeavours and pregnancy). The timing of first intercourse can be heritable - shorter [[alleles]] of the X-linked androgen receptor (AR) gene has been associated with aggression, impulsivity, high number of sexual partners, divorce in males and earlier ages of physical maturation in females.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Mechanisms to balance father absence ==

=== Matrilineal support ===

Despite being poorer overall, [[widow]]ed and [[divorce]]d women are on average 2.4&amp;nbsp;kg heavier than women whose children's fathers are present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Widowed and divorced mothers as well as their daughters are reported to have substantially improved [[nutrition]]al status which could be explained by them having greater access to the mother's relatives ([[matrilateral]] kin). Furthermore, proximity to a mother's relatives can dramatically improve female children's height for age, an indicator of good nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Mhairi A.|last2=Mace|first2=Ruth|title=Helpful grandmothers in rural Ethiopia: A study of the effect of kin on child survival and growth|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513805000206|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=6|pages=469–482|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who return to their village of birth following marital dissolution are seen to benefit from extra matrilateral kin support,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulder|first=Monique Borgerhoff|date=1998-06-01|title=Brothers and sisters|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-998-1001-6|journal=Human Nature|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–161|doi=10.1007/s12110-998-1001-6|issn=1045-6767}}&lt;/ref&gt; which replaces the help of the missing husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hadza grandmothers as helpers: Residence data.

In line with this topic, parents will be informed of the underlying behaviours of children as a result of absence of parent following divorce. The study will also enlighten parents on the roles they play to shape their children when they live as a couple, therefore, parents will try to their best to reconcile their differences and live as one. The challenges that young adults at the age of 14 to 25 years and whose parents divorced faces as they enter into romantic relationships are revealed. The aim of the study is to explore knowledge relating to counselling of such cases.
The study will be easier when the scope is mentioned. This is the area the study will cover or rather the number of respondents. The study on ‘The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce,’ will be focus on pre-schoolers, adolescents as well as young adults in a particular area which can be certain learning institutions within a specific city. There are also certain assumptions which a researcher will have to make in this study. For example, it will be assumed that at the time the research will be done. All the learning institutions will be on session and can be accessed and that the respondents will be willing to share the information required.

As part of the research, a literature review is necessary. This will involve carrying out various theoretical reviews to examine various theories related to the topic under study. Such theories will include attachment theory, social learning theory, among many others. The theories will lay a foundation to the topic. Moreover, empirical review is another part of literature review where various literary works carried out by other researchers relating to the topic of study are examined in detail.

The research design in relation to the topic of this study will be descriptive survey design. The target population will be all the students in the learning institutions selected that will be used for the research. Stratified sampling design is suitable for the study since data will be collected and based on three strata; pre-schoolers, secondary and college. Data collection will be by use of questionnaires and finally, data analysis will be both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative will encompass such descriptive statistics as mean and standard deviation while the qualitative will take into account attaching significance to the themes as well as the patterns observed (Bryman, 2008).
The results and findings will be finally presented summarizing the information obtained from data collection and analysed. The summary of the findings will provide answers to the research questions, reveal the challenges experienced throughout the research and expose gabs that can aid in further research concerning the topic.

The research especially when administering questionnaires and interviews if any should be carried out in a manner which is within two key aspects: conforming to ethical practices and adhering to approved protocol. Ethical practices in research are very vital and plays a very important role in protecting the rights and privacy of the respondents. The use of human subjects is a critical ethical consideration. This study will have to adhere to the guidelines set by Institutional Review Board of the schools which data will be collected.  The board is composed of people who will check to ensure that the information gathered from the respondents are safe and that human rights of the respondents are not violated in any case. The ethical considerations that are relevant to this study will involve voluntary participation by the respondents and the informed consent (Vanclay, 2013).
It is important to note that ethical standards very important roles in this research work. They guarantee that all human subjects that become respondents in the study accepted freely and wilfully to participate and that they have been fully updated on the purpose of the research. Moreover, the subjects’ confidentiality and anonymity is highly protected.

=== Presence of a stepfather ===

In light of certain research, father absence can be disadvantageous; certain evidence suggests stepfather presence does not reduce these disadvantages but in fact has a worsening effect on such issues. For example, the [[Cinderella effect]], which refers to the observation that stepchildren are at a dramatically increased risk of physical abuse and homicide than children living with their biological parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Martin|last2=Wilson|first2=Margo|title=The truth about cinderella : a Darwinian view of parental love|date=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300080298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flinn|first1=Mark V.|title=Step- and genetic parent/offspring relationships in a Caribbean village|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|date=November 1988|volume=9|issue=6|pages=335–369|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(88)90026-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilton|first1=N.

In accordance with their findings, results show that girls raised in families with stepfathers exhibit a significantly earlier age of menarche than girls raised without stepfathers.

Relative to other groups, children with a constantly absent biological father but a stepfather present reported more frequent incidences of [[sexual intercourse]], as well as an earlier onset of sexual behaviour. The mean age of children with their biological father absent or partially absent is approximately 15. A higher percentage of children with a constantly absent biological father reported having sexual intercourse than those in the partially absent group. Those with a stepfather present and those with a biological father always absent have the earliest first time experiences of sexual intercourse at on average 15.11 years old, whereas children without a stepfather or their biological father partially absent at the age of 15.38 experience their first encounter of sexual intercourse. The effect of having a partially absent biological father with stepfather absence and the effect both stepfather or biological father absence are the same. This study indicated that the presence of a stepfather is not compensating to the disadvantages of a biological father being absent. In some situations, it can cause an even bigger negative effect on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendle|first=Jane|last2=Harden|first2=K.

==Introduction==
Geography is a systematic study of the Universe and its features. Traditionally, geography has been associated with [[cartography]] and place names. Although many geographers are trained in [[toponymy]] and [[Cartography|cartology]], this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the [[space]] and the [[temporal database]] distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the [[interaction]] of humans and their [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webhost.bridgew.edu/jhayesboh/environmentalgeography.htm|title=What is Environmental Geography, Anyway?|last=Hayes-Bohanan|first=James|date=29 September 2009|website=webhost.bridgew.edu|publisher=[[Bridgewater State University]]|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as [[economics]], [[health]], [[climate]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and its spatial patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Settlement_Geography.html?id=DLpzQgAACAAJ|title=An introduction to Settlement Geography|last=Hornby|first=William F.|last2=Jones|first2=Melvyn|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521282635|publication-date=29 June 1991|pages=|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=|date=1991-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text= Names of places...are not geography...know by heart a whole [[gazetteer]] full of them would not, in itself, constitute anyone a [[geographer]]. Geography has higher aims than this: it seeks to classify phenomena (alike of the natural and of the political world, in so far as it treats of the latter), to compare, to generalize, to ascend from effects to causes, and, in doing so, to trace out the laws of nature and to mark their influences upon man. This is 'a description of the world'—that is Geography. In a word Geography is a Science—a thing not of mere names but of argument and reason, of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, William. (1863).

Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main subsidiary fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former largely focuses on the [[built environment]] and how humans create, view, manage, and influence space. The latter examines the natural environment, and how [[organism]]s, climate, [[soil]], [[water]], and [[landform]]s produce and interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=American Association of Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |accessdate=October 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these approaches led to a third field, [[environmental geography]], which combines physical and human geography and concerns the interactions between the environment and humans.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"/&gt;

==Branches==

===Physical geography===
{{Main|Physical geography}}

Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an [[Earth science]]. It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of [[lithosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[pedosphere]], and global [[flora]] and [[fauna]] patterns ([[biosphere]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Human geography===
{{Main|Human geography}}

Human geography is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape the human society. It encompasses the [[human]], [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], [[social]], and [[economics|economic]] aspects.

&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="Human geography can be divided into many broad categories, such as:"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Various approaches to the study of human geography have also arisen through time and include:
* [[Behavioral geography]]
* [[Feminist geography]]
* [[Culture theory]]
* [[Geosophy]]

===Environmental geography===
{{Main|Integrated geography}}

Environmental [[Integrated geography|geography]] is concerned with the description of the spatial interactions between humans and the [[Natural environment|natural world]]. It requires an understanding of the traditional aspects of physical and human geography, as well as the ways that human societies conceptualize the environment. Environmental geography has emerged as a bridge between the human and the physical geography, as a result of the increasing specialisation of the two sub-fields. Furthermore, as human relationship with the environment has changed as a result of [[globalization]] and [[technological change]], a new approach was needed to understand the changing and dynamic relationship. Examples of areas of research in the environmental geography include: [[emergency management]], [[environmental management]], [[sustainability]], and [[political ecology]].

===Geomatics===
{{Main|Geomatics}}

[[File:Geabios3d.jpg|thumb|right|Digital Elevation Model (DEM)]]
[[Geomatics]] is concerned with the application of computers to the traditional spatial techniques used in [[cartography]] and [[topography]]. Geomatics emerged from the [[quantitative revolution]] in geography in the mid-1950s. Today, geomatics methods include [[spatial analysis]], [[geographic information system|geographic information systems (GIS)]], [[remote sensing]], and [[global positioning system|global positioning systems (GPS)]]. Geomatics has led to a revitalization of some geography departments, especially in Northern America where the subject had a declining status during the 1950s.

===Regional geography===
{{Main|Regional geography}}

Regional geography is concerned with the description of the unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural or human elements. The main aim is to understand, or define the uniqueness, or character of a particular region that consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to [[regionalisation|regionalization]], which covers the proper techniques of space [[delimitation]] into regions.

===Related fields===
* [[Urban planning]], [[regional planning]], and [[spatial planning]]: Use the science of geography to assist in determining how to develop (or not develop) the land to meet particular criteria, such as safety, beauty, economic opportunities, the preservation of the built or natural heritage, and so on. The planning of towns, cities, and rural areas may be seen as [[applied geography]].
* [[Regional science]]: In the 1950s, the regional science movement led by [[Walter Isard]] arose to provide a more quantitative and analytical base to geographical questions, in contrast to the descriptive tendencies of traditional geography programs. Regional science comprises the body of knowledge in which the spatial dimension plays a fundamental role, such as [[regional science|regional economics]], [[resource management]], [[location theory]], [[urban planning|urban]] and [[regional planning]], [[transport]] and [[communication]], [[human geography]], population distribution, [[landscape ecology]], and environmental quality.
* [[Planetary science|Interplanetary Sciences]]: While the discipline of geography is normally concerned with the [[Earth]], the term can also be informally used to describe the study of other worlds, such as the [[planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] and even beyond. The study of systems larger than the Earth itself usually forms part of [[Astronomy]] or [[Cosmology]]. The study of other planets is usually called [[planetary science]]. Alternative terms such as [[Geology of Mars|areology]] (the study of Mars) have been proposed but are not widely used.

==Techniques==
As spatial interrelationships are key to this synoptic science, [[map]]s are a key tool. Classical [[cartography]] has been joined by a more modern approach to geographical analysis, computer-based [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).

In their study, geographers use four interrelated approaches:
* Systematic&amp;nbsp;– Groups geographical knowledge into categories that can be explored globally.
* Regional&amp;nbsp;– Examines systematic relationships between categories for a specific region or location on the planet.
* Descriptive&amp;nbsp;– Simply specifies the locations of features and populations.
* Analytical&amp;nbsp;– Asks ''why'' we find features and populations in a specific geographic area.

===Cartography===
[[File:Cook chart of New Zealand.jpg|thumb|[[James Cook]]'s 1770 chart of [[New Zealand]]]]
{{Main|Cartography}}

Cartography studies the representation of the Earth's surface with abstract symbols (map making). Although other subdisciplines of geography rely on maps for presenting their analyses, the actual making of maps is abstract enough to be regarded separately. Cartography has grown from a collection of drafting techniques into an actual science.

Cartographers must learn [[cognitive psychology]] and [[ergonomics]] to understand which symbols convey information about the Earth most effectively, and [[behaviorism|behavioural psychology]] to induce the readers of their maps to act on the information. They must learn [[geodesy]] and fairly advanced [[mathematics]] to understand how the [[Figure of the Earth|shape of the Earth]] affects the distortion of map symbols projected onto a flat surface for viewing. It can be said, without much controversy, that cartography is the seed from which the larger field of geography grew. Most geographers will cite a childhood fascination with maps as an early sign they would end up in the field.

===Geographic information systems===
{{Main|Geographic information system}}
&lt;!-- the section's use of a singular verb for a seemingly plural noun is intentional. The name of the academic subject is "Geographic information systems". If you didn't care about parallel construction, you could precede the following with THE SUBJECT OF ---&gt;
Geographic information systems (GIS) deal with the storage of information about the Earth for automatic retrieval by a computer, in an accurate manner appropriate to the information's purpose. In addition to all of the other subdisciplines of geography, GIS specialists must understand [[computer science]] and [[database]] systems. GIS has revolutionized the field of cartography: nearly all mapmaking is now done with the assistance of some form of [[List of GIS software|GIS software]]. GIS also refers to the science of using GIS software and GIS techniques to represent, analyse, and predict the spatial relationships. In this context, GIS stands for ''geographic information science''.

===Remote sensing===
{{Main|Remote sensing}}
Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about Earth features from measurements made at a distance. Remotely sensed data comes in many forms, such as [[satellite imagery]], [[aerial photography]], and data obtained from hand-held sensors. Geographers increasingly use remotely sensed data to obtain information about the Earth's [[land surface]], ocean, and atmosphere, because it: (a) supplies objective information at a variety of spatial scales (local to global), (b) provides a synoptic view of the area of interest, (c) allows access to distant and inaccessible sites, (d) provides spectral information outside the visible portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and (e) facilitates studies of how features/areas change over time. Remotely sensed data may be analysed either independently of, or in conjunction with other digital data layers (e.g., in a geographic information system).

===Quantitative methods===
{{Main|Geostatistics}}

[[Geostatistics]] deal with [[Numerical data|quantitative data]] analysis, specifically the application of statistical methodology to the exploration of geographic phenomena. Geostatistics is used extensively in a variety of fields, including [[hydrology]], [[geology]], [[petroleum]] exploration, weather analysis, [[urban planning]], [[logistics]], and [[epidemiology]]. The mathematical basis for geostatistics derives from [[cluster analysis]], [[linear discriminant analysis]] and [[non-parametric statistics|non-parametric statistical tests]], and a variety of other subjects. Applications of geostatistics rely heavily on [[geographic information system]]s, particularly for the [[interpolation]] (estimate) of unmeasured points. Geographers are making notable contributions to the method of quantitative techniques.

===Qualitative methods===
{{Main|Ethnography}}
Geographic qualitative methods, or ethnographical research techniques, are used by human geographers. In [[cultural geography]] there is a tradition of employing [[qualitative research]] techniques, also used in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. [[Participant observation]] and in-depth interviews provide human geographers with qualitative data.

==History==
{{Main|History of geography}}

The oldest known [[world map]]s date back to [[ancient Babylon]] from the 9th century BC.&lt;ref name="Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J.A. Talbert 2009 147"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Geography and Ethnography: Perceptions of the World in Pre-Modern Societies |author=Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J.A.

Raaflaub &amp; Richard J.A. Talbert 2009 147"/&gt;

The ideas of [[Anaximander]] (c. 610–545 BC): considered by later Greek writers to be the true founder of geography, come to us through fragments quoted by his successors. Anaximander is credited with the invention of the [[gnomon]], the simple, yet efficient Greek instrument that allowed the early measurement of [[latitude]]. [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] is also credited with the prediction of eclipses. The foundations of geography can be traced to the ancient cultures, such as the ancient, medieval, and early modern [[History of China|Chinese]]. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], who were the first to explore geography as both [[art]] and [[science]], achieved this through [[History of cartography|Cartography]], [[Greek philosophy|Philosophy]], and [[Ancient Greek literature|Literature]], or through [[History of mathematics|Mathematics]]. There is some debate about who was the first person to assert that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth is spherical]] in shape, with the credit going either to [[Parmenides]] or [[Pythagoras]]. [[Anaxagoras]] was able to demonstrate that the profile of the Earth was circular by explaining [[eclipse]]s. However, he still believed that the Earth was a flat disk, as did many of his contemporaries. One of the first estimates of the radius of the Earth was made by [[Eratosthenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Concise_History_of_Solar_and_Stellar_P.html?id=nRtUait0qTgC|title=A Concise History of Solar and Stellar Physics|first=Jean-Louis|last2=Tassoul|first2=Monique|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0691117119|location=London|pages=|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=|author=Tassoul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rigorous system of [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]] lines is credited to [[Hipparchus]]. He employed a [[sexagesimal]] system that was derived from [[Babylonian mathematics]]. The meridians were sub-divided into 360°, with each degree further subdivided into 60 ([[minute of arc|minutes]]). To measure the longitude at different locations on Earth, he suggested using eclipses to determine the relative difference in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/3/58.html|title=Hipparchus of Rhodes|last=|first=|date=2001|website=tmth.edu.gr|publisher=[[Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720120522/http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/3/58.html|archive-date=20 July 2008|dead-url=yes|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive mapping by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as they explored new lands would later provide a high level of information for [[Ptolemy]] to construct detailed [[atlas]]es. He extended the work of [[Hipparchus]], using a grid system on his maps and adopting a length of 56.5 miles for a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers2000/sullivan.html|title=Mapmaking and its History|last=Sullivan|first=Dan|date=2000|website=|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 3rd century onwards, [[History of China|Chinese]] methods of geographical study and writing of geographical literature became much more comprehensive than what was found in Europe at the time (until the 13th century).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 512"/&gt; Chinese geographers such as [[Liu An]], [[Pei Xiu]], [[Jia Dan]], [[Shen Kuo]], [[Fan Chengda]], [[Zhou Daguan]], and [[Xu Xiake]] wrote important treatises, yet by the 17th century advanced ideas and methods of Western-style geography were adopted in China.

[[File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg|thumb|The [[Ptolemy world map]], reconstituted from [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Geographia'', written {{circa|150}}]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman empire]] led to a shift in the evolution of geography from [[Europe]] to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 512"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|year=1959|title=Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Volume.html?id=jfQ9E0u4pLAC|journal=Science and Civilization in China|location=Taipei|publisher=Caves Books, Ltd.|volume=3|page=512|isbn=978-0521058018|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geography in medieval Islam|Muslim geographers]] such as [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] produced detailed world maps (such as [[Tabula Rogeriana]]), while other geographers such as [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]], [[Ibn Battuta]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]] provided detailed accounts of their journeys and the geography of the regions they visited. Turkish geographer, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] drew a world map on a linguistic basis, and later so did [[Piri Reis]] ([[Piri Reis map]]).

He often combined astronomical readings and mathematical equations, in order to develop methods of pin-pointing locations by recording degrees of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. He also developed similar techniques when it came to measuring the heights of [[mountain]]s, depths of the [[valley]]s, and expanse of the [[horizon]]. He also discussed [[human geography]] and the [[planetary habitability]] of the [[Earth]].

The European [[Age of Discovery]] during the 16th and the 17th centuries, where many new lands were discovered and accounts by European explorers such as [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Marco Polo]], and [[James Cook]] revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail, and more solid theoretical foundations in Europe. The problem facing both explorers and geographers was finding the latitude and longitude of a geographic location. The problem of latitude was solved long ago but that of longitude remained; agreeing on what zero meridian should be was only part of the problem. It was left to [[John Harrison]] to solve it by inventing the chronometer [[Harrison Number Four|H-4]] in 1760, and later in 1884 for the [[International Meridian Conference]] to adopt by convention the [[Greenwich meridian]] as zero meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bz4GyOioMF4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA164#v=onepage|title=Voyages that changed the world|last=Aughton|first=Peter|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1847240040|location=|page=164|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th and the 19th centuries were the times when geography became recognized as a discrete [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]], and became part of a typical [[university]] curriculum in [[Europe]] (especially [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]). The development of many geographic societies also occurred during the 19th century, with the foundations of the [[Société de Géographie]] in 1821,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socgeo.org/la-societe/qui-sommes-nous|title=Société de Géographie, Paris, France|last=|first=|date=|website=socgeo.org|publisher=Société de Géographie|language=French|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/about+us.htm |title=About Us |last= |first= |date= |website=rgs.org |publisher=[[Royal Geographical Society]] |accessdate=10 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192946/http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/About%2Bus.htm |archivedate=18 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Geographical Society]] in 1845,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rgo.org.ru/ |title=Русское Географическое Общество (основано в 1845 г.) |last= |first= |date= |website=rgo.org.ru |publisher=[[Russian Geological Society]] |language=Russian |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524183911/http://www.rgo.org.ru/ |archive-date=2012-05-24 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=10 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Geographical Society]] in 1851,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americangeo.org/history/|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=Amergeog.org|publisher=The American Geographical Society|accessdate=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017130118/http://americangeo.org/history/|archive-date=2016-10-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Geographic Society]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/io/unesco/members/48805.htm|title=National Geographic Society|last=|first=|date=|website=state.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Carl Ritter]], and [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] can be seen as a major turning point in geography from a philosophy to an academic subject.

Over the past two centuries, the advancements in technology with computers have led to the development of [[geomatics]] and new practices such as participant observation and geostatistics being incorporated into geography's portfolio of tools. In the West during the 20th century, the discipline of geography went through four major phases: [[environmental determinism]], [[regional geography]], the [[quantitative revolution]], and [[critical geography]]. The strong interdisciplinary links between geography and the sciences of [[geology]] and [[botany]], as well as [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[demographics]] have also grown greatly, especially as a result of [[earth system science]] that seeks to understand the world in a holistic view.

The connections and pathways of the internet could be seen as the pathways of [[neurons]] and [[synapse]]s in a global brain]]

The '''global brain''' is a neuroscience-inspired and futurological vision of the planetary [[information and communications technology]] [[computer network|network]] that interconnects all humans and their technological artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heylighen|first1=F.|title=What is the global brain?|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIFAQ.html|website=Principa Cybernetica Web|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As this network stores ever more [[information]], takes over ever more functions of coordination and communication from traditional organizations, and becomes increasingly [[intelligent]], it increasingly plays the role of a [[brain]] for the planet [[Earth]].

==Basic ideas==
Proponents of the global brain hypothesis claim that the [[Internet]] increasingly ties its users together into a single information processing system that functions as part of the collective [[nervous system]] of the planet. The intelligence of this network is [[collective intelligence|collective]] or [[distributed cognition|distributed]]: it is not centralized or localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. Therefore, no one can command or control it. Rather, it [[self-organization|self-organizes]] or [[emergence|emerges]] from the [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of [[human–computer interaction|interactions]] between its components. This is a property typical of [[complex adaptive systems]].&lt;ref name=CAS-T-17/&gt;

The [[World-wide web]] in particular resembles the organization of a brain with its webpages (playing a role similar to [[neurons]]) connected by [[hyperlinks]] (playing a role similar to [[synapses]]), together forming an [[Association (psychology)|associative]] network along which information propagates.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"&gt;{{cite conference | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 =  Francis | last2 = Bollen | first2 = J. | date = 1996 | title = The World-Wide Web as a Super-Brain: from metaphor to model | editor-first = R. | editor-last = Trappl  | conference = Cybernetics and Systems' 96 | publisher = Austrian Society For Cybernetics | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/WWW-Super-Brain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy becomes stronger with the rise of [[social media]], such as [[Facebook]], where links between personal pages represent relationships in a [[social network]] along which information propagates from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinbaum | first = D. | date = 2012 | title = A Framework for Scalable Cognition: Propagation of challenges, towards the implementation of Global Brain models | publisher = GBI working paper 2012-02 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ECCO/ECCO-Papers/Weaver-Attention.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such propagation is similar to the [[spreading activation]] that [[neural networks]] in the brain use to process information in a parallel, distributed manner.

==History==
Although some of the underlying ideas were already expressed by [[Nikola Tesla]] in the late 19th century and were written about by many others before him,  the term “global brain” was coined in 1982 by [[Peter Russell (writer)|Peter Russell]] in his book ''The Global Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Peter Russell (physicist) | last = Russell | first = P. | date = 1983 | title = The Global Brain: speculations on the evolutionary leap to planetary consciousness | location = Los Angeles | publisher = JP Tarcher }}&lt;/ref&gt; How the Internet might be developed to achieve this was set out in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Andrews | first = D. | date =  February 1986 | title = Information routeing groups – Towards the global superbrain: or how to find out what you need to know rather than what you think you need to know | journal = Journal of Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–35 | doi=10.1057/jit.1986.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by [[Gottfried Mayer-Kress]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer-Kress | first1 = G. | last2 = Barczys | first2 = C. | date = 1995 | title = The global brain as an emergent structure from the Worldwide Computing Network, and its implications for modeling | journal = The information society | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–27 | url = http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | doi = 10.1080/01972243.1995.9960177 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120907044231/http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | archivedate = 2012-09-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the first [[algorithms]] that could turn the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Johan Bollen]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Bollen | first1 = J. | authorlink2 = Francis Heylighen | last2 = Heylighen | first2 = Francis | date = 1996 | title = Algorithms for the self-organization of distributed, multi-user networks.

Reviewing the strands of intellectual history that contributed to the global brain hypothesis, [[Francis Heylighen]] distinguishes four perspectives: ''“organicism”'', ''“encyclopedism”'', ''“emergentism”'' and ''“evolutionary cybernetics”''. He asserts that these developed in relative independence but now are converging in his own scientific re-formulation.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 = Francis | date = 2011 | chapterurl = http://pcp.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf | chapter = Conceptions of a Global Brain: an historical review | title = Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social | editor1-last = Grinin | editor1-first = L.

=== Organicism ===
In the 19th century, the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] saw society as a [[social organism]] and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler|William Wheeler]] developed the concept of the ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term [[superorganism]] to describe such an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = William Morton Wheeler | last = Wheeler | first = William | date = 1911 | title = The Ant Colony as an Organism | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 22 | pages = 307–325 | doi=10.1002/jmor.1050220206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as [[Gregory Stock]] in his book [[Metaman]] and [[Joel de Rosnay]] to describe planetary society as a superorganism.

The mental aspects of such an organic system at the planetary level were perhaps first broadly elaborated by palaeontologist and Jesuit priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In 1945, he described a coming “planetisation” of humanity, which he saw as the next phase of accelerating human “socialisation”. Teilhard described both socialization and planetization as irreversible, irresistible processes of ''macrobiological development'' culminating in the emergence of a [[noosphere]], or global mind (see Emergentism below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap VII – The Planetisation of Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[living systems theory]] describes both organisms and social systems in terms of the "critical subsystems" ("organs") they need to contain in order to survive, such as an internal transport system, a resource reserve, and a decision-making system. This theory has inspired several thinkers, including Peter Russell and Francis Heylighen to define the global brain as the network of information processing subsystems for the planetary social system.

=== Encyclopedism ===
In the perspective of encyclopedism, the emphasis is on developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. However, by the end of the 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, [[Paul Otlet]] founded the science of documentation, now called [[information science]]. In the 1930s he envisaged a [[World Wide Web]]-like system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. [[H. G. Wells]] proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a [[World Brain]], as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet, although the image of humanity acting informally as a more organic global brain is a recurring motif in other of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=H.G. Wells | title=The New Machiavelli| quote="But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking them! ... And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain; — the ideas go on — as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], too, was inspired by the free-associative possibilities of the brain for his invention. The brain can link different kinds of information without any apparent link otherwise; Berners-Lee thought that computers could become much more powerful if they could imitate this functioning, i.e. make links between any arbitrary piece of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Berners-Lee|1999|pp=4, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful implementation of encyclopedism to date is Wikipedia, which integrates the associative powers of the world-wide-web with the collective intelligence of its millions of contributors, approaching the ideal of a global memory.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"/&gt; The [[Semantic web]], also first proposed by Berners-Lee, is a system of protocols to make the pieces of knowledge and their links readable by machines, so that they could be used to make automatic [[inference]]s, thus providing this brain-like network with some capacity for autonomous "thinking" or reflection.

=== Emergentism ===
This approach focuses on the emergent aspects of the evolution and development of [[complexity]], including the spiritual, psychological, and moral-ethical aspects of the global brain, and is at present the most speculative approach. The global brain is here seen as a natural and emergent process of planetary evolutionary development. Here again [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] attempted a synthesis of science, social values, and religion in his [[The Phenomenon of Man]], which argues that the ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (drive, purpose) of universal evolutionary process is the development of greater levels of both complexity and consciousness. Teilhard proposed that if life persists then planetization, as a biological process producing a global brain, would necessarily also produce a global mind, a new level of planetary consciousness and a technologically supported network of thoughts which he called the ''[[noosphere]]''. Teilhard's proposed technological layer for the noosphere can be interpreted as an early anticipation of the Internet and the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap X – The Formation of the Noosphere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and philosopher [[Peter Russell (physicist)|Peter Russell]] elaborates a similar view, and stresses the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism. This approach is most popular in [[New Age]] circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems.

===Evolutionary cybernetics===
[[Systems theory|Systems theorists]] and [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] commonly describe the emergence of a higher order system in evolutionary development as a “[[metasystem transition]]” (a concept introduced by [[Valentin Turchin]]) or a “major evolutionary transition”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The major evolutionary transitions | authorlink1 = Eörs Szathmáry | first1 = Eörs | last1 = Szathmáry | authorlink2 = John Maynard Smith | first2 = John | last2 = Maynard Smith | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 374 | pages = 227–232 | date = 16 March 1995 | doi = 10.1038/374227a0 | pmid=7885442| bibcode = 1995Natur.374..227S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a metasystem consists of a group of subsystems that work together in a coordinated, goal-directed manner. It is as such much more powerful and intelligent than its constituent systems. [[Francis Heylighen]] has argued that the global brain is an emerging metasystem with respect to the level of individual human intelligence, and investigated the specific evolutionary mechanisms that promote this transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2008 | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf | chapter = Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain | title = Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change | publisher = Routledge | page = 284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the Internet fulfils the role of the network of “nerves” that interconnect the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of [[self-organization]] through which such coordination and [[collective intelligence]] emerges.

== Recent developments ==
In 1994 [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], in his popular book ''[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of Control]]'', posited the emergence of a "[[Collective consciousness|hive mind]]" from a discussion of cybernetics and evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=ooc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Addison-Wesley| isbn = 0201577933| authorlink = Kevin Kelly (editor) | last = Kelly | first = Kevin| title = [[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization]]| location = Reading, Mass| date = 1994| pages = 5–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Ben Goertzel]] founded the Global Brain group, a discussion forum grouping most of the researchers that had been working on the subject of the global brain to further investigate this phenomenon. The group organized the first international conference on the topic in 2001 at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

After a period of relative neglect, the Global Brain idea has recently seen a resurgence in interest, in part due to talks given on the topic by [[Tim O'Reilly]], the Internet forecaster who popularized the term [[Web 2.0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | authorlink = Tim O'Reilly | first = Tim | last = O'Reilly | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/video/2012/03/22/towards-global-brain?ms=42144 | title = Towards a Global Brain | series = One Great Idea | date = March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuri Milner]], the social media investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Chrystia | last = Freeland | website = blogs.reuters.com | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ | title = The advent of the global brain }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the Global Brain Institute (GBI) was founded at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] to develop a mathematical theory of the “brainlike” propagation of information across the Internet. In the same year, [[Thomas W. Malone]] and collaborators from the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]]  have started to explore how the global brain could be “programmed” to work more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Klein | first2 = M. | authorlink3 = Thomas W. Malone | last3 = Malone | first3 = Thomas W. | date = 2012 | title = Programming the Global Brain | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | page = 41 | url = http://cci.mit.edu/publications/CCIwp2011-04.pdf | doi=10.1145/2160718.2160731}}&lt;/ref&gt; using mechanisms of [[collective intelligence]]. The complexity scientist [[Dirk Helbing]] and his NervousNet group have recently started developing a "Planetary Nervous System", which includes a "Global Participatory Platform", as part of the large-scale [[FuturICT]] project, thus preparing some of the groundwork for a Global Brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Dirk Helbing | last1 = Helbing | first1 = Dirk | date = 2015 | chapter = Creating (“Making”) a Planetary Nervous System as Citizen Web | title = Thinking Ahead – Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society | pages = 189–194 | publisher = Springer International Publishing | chapterurl = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15078-9_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 [[Elon Musk]] founded the company [[Neuralink]], which aims to create a Neural Lace, which is a concept invented by the novelist [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]] and basically refers to a machine interface woven into the brain, to allow the user to access all available human information. A core driver behind this business idea is Mr Musk’s argument, that human beings soon have to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by [[artificial intelligence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719774-do-human-beings-need-embrace-brain-implants-stay-relevant-elon-musk-enters|title=Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm raised $27m from 12 Investors in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-startup-a7916891.html|title=Elon Musk could be about to spend $100m linking human brains to computers|date=2017-08-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
A common criticism of the idea that humanity would become directed by a global brain is that this would reduce individual diversity and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayward | first = W. B. | date = 1999 | title = H. G. Wells' s idea of a World Brain: A critical reassessment | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 7 | pages = 557–573 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.85.1010 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:7&lt;557::aid-asi2&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lead to [[mass surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brooks | first = M. | date = June 24, 2000 | url = http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0006/msg00182.html | title = Global brain | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2244 | page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is inspired by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] forms of government, as exemplified by [[George Orwell|George Orwell']]s character of "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]". It is also inspired by the analogy between collective intelligence or [[swarm intelligence]] and [[insect societies]], such as beehives and ant colonies, in which individuals are essentially interchangeable. In a more extreme view, the global brain has been compared with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goertzel | first = Ben | date = 2002 | title = Creating Internet Intelligence: Wild computing, distributed digital consciousness, and the emerging global brain | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | url = {{google books|id=Vnzb-xLdvv8C|plainurl=yes}} | isbn = 9780306467356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the race of collectively thinking cyborgs conceived by the [[Star Trek]] science fiction franchise.

Global brain theorists reply that the emergence of distributed intelligence would lead to the exact opposite of this vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2007 | title = The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society | journal = Social Evolution &amp; History | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–119 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/Superorganism.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2002 | chapter = Das Globale Gehirn als neue Utopia |trans-chapter=The global brain as a new utopia | publisher = Suhrkamp | location = Frankurt | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-Utopia.pdf | editor1-first = R. | editor1-last = Maresch | editor2-first = F. | editor2-last = Rötzer | title = Renaissance der Utopie }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that effective [[collective intelligence]] requires [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] of opinion, [[decentralization]] and individual independence, as demonstrated by [[James Surowiecki]] in his book [[The Wisdom of Crowds]]. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.

'''Infopoverty''' is the name given to the Programme and the World Conference started in 2001, in the ambit of the United Nations, aimed to fight poverty towards the application of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], Information and Communication Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketpress.info/notiziario_det.php?art=3958 Marketpress]: Pierpaolo Saporito, Presidente di OCCAM, nominato High Level Advisor dell'alleanza globale delle Nazioni Unite per le ICT e lo sviluppo . Tale nomina, confermata con lettera del Vice Segretario Generale della Nazioni Unite, Jose Antonio Ocampo, rappresenta un importante riconoscimento dell'Onu per il lavoro svolto da Occam e dal Programma Infopoverty nella lotta alla povertà attraverso le nuove tecnologie della comunicazione e dell'informazione&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has been coined in 1998 by Arch. Pierpaolo Saporito, Founder and President of [[OCCAM - Observatory on Digital Communication]] and Gerardo Zepeda-Bermudez, Vice-President and Member of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qn.quotidiano.net/esteri/2011/03/26/479979-poverta_combattere_grazie_cellulare.shtml Quotidiano]: Pierpaolo Saporito, presidente di OCCAM, fondatore insieme al Parlamento Europeo e le Nazioni Unite di Infopoverty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infopoverty World Conference==
The Infopoverty World Conference is the annual international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, at the United Nations headquarters, New York,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chhavi Rajawat|Wikipedia]]: Infopoverty World Conference held at the United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[Observatory of Digital Communications|OCCAM]], together with the [[European Parliament]], [[UNESCO]], and other scientific and university institutions (Infopoverty Institute at Oklahoma University).&lt;ref&gt;[http://infopoverty.ou.edu]: The Infopoverty Institute coordinates with the Observatory for Cultural and Audiovisual Communication (OCCAM) and collaborates with the international community in applying these services especially to impoverished communities around the world.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmeplus.eu/2011/03/infopoverty-world-conference-2011-24-25-march/ Emmeplus]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: The Infopoverty Programme was started by the first Infopoverty World Conference Conference, organized by OCCAM in 2001 with the European Parliament, UNESCO Mediterranean Programme, UNIC and other scientific and universityThe Infopoverty Programme was started by the first Infopoverty World Conference Conference, organized by OCCAM in 2001 with the European Parliament, UNESCO Mediterranean Programme, UNIC and other scientific and university institutions&lt;/ref&gt; At its 13th edition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-ngls.org/spip.php?article4261]:Article on the 13th Infopoverty World Conference in United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service e-bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; the Infopoverty World Conference saw the participation of more than 100 international organizations,hundreds of from Governments, international and regional organizations, public and private institutions and the civil society and 63 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmeplus.eu/2011/03/infopoverty-world-conference-2011-24-25-march/Emmeplus]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:The past editions of the Infopoverty World Conference enjoyed the participation of more than 100 international organizations, 10000 participants from Governments&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infopoverty Programme==
The Infopoverty Programme transfers into concrete actions the orientations emerged from the Conference, realizing the ICT Villages, aimed to help the most disadvantaged communities.The first pilot projects were realized at San Ramon and San Pedro, Honduras, in cooperation with the local Ministry of Science and Technologies, following the devastation from Hurricane Mitch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130218135950/http://telecom.esa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=28074 ESA]: Whole areas were left without either electricity or telephone. Two villages, however, Saint Ramon and San Pedro were supplied with solar energy and with satellite terminals allowing broadband connection to the Internet&lt;/ref&gt;
These experiences were instrumental for the definition, thanks to the collaboration with the most important international institutions, of the ICT Village model,&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://www.infopoverty.net/mission.html%20 Infopoverty Programme – Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326003107/http://www.infopoverty.net/mission.html |date=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; validated by the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, 2005, with the creation of the Borj Touil Village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystalweb.it/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=396 Crystalweb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602051006/http://www.crystalweb.it/modules.php?name=News |date=2 June 2013 }}: Infopoverty Programme al summit mondiale sulla società dell'informazione&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Science Festival in Gothenburg''' (Swedish: '''Vetenskapsfestivalen''') is an annual [[festival]] in [[Gothenburg]] with science activities.

== About the festival ==
The International Science Festival in Gothenburg took place for the first time in April 1997 and is since then an annual recurrent event.
The purpose is to communicate science to the public and schools in an easy accessible and in a thought provoking manner&lt;!--check translation--&gt;. Another objective is to create a positive attitude to [[research]] and [[science]] which is intended to encourage [[Education in Sweden#Higher education|higher education]].

About {{nowrap|100 000 visitors}} come each year.&lt;ref name=vgforsok&gt;[http://www.vartgoteborg.se/prod/sk/vargotnu.nsf/1/utbildning,varldsrekordforsok_inleder_goteborgs_tolfte_vetenskapsfestival vartgoteborg.se - Världsrekordförsök inleder Göteborgs tolfte vetenskapsfestival], Vårt Göteborg, 11 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the largest popular science event in [[Sweden]]&lt;ref name=festhome&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061101015134/http://www.goteborg.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=1601 goteborg.com - Festivalens hemsida] (archivelink 2006-11-01)&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest popular science events in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=fof08&gt;[http://www.fof.se/index.lasso?id=08364c Forskning och framsteg, 3/08 sid 64] (dead link 2012-04-24)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josephine Elizabeth Butler''' (''{{nee}}'' '''Grey'''; 13 April 1828&amp;nbsp;– 30 December 1906) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] and [[social reform]]er in the [[Victorian era]].  She campaigned for [[women's suffrage]], the right of women to better education, the end of [[coverture]] in British law, the abolition of [[child prostitution]], and an end to [[human trafficking]] of young women and children into European [[prostitution]].

Grey grew up in a well-to-do and politically connected [[progressivism|progressive]] family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married [[George Butler (1819–1890)|George Butler]], an [[Anglicanism#Anglican divines|Anglican divine]] and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a banister. The death was a turning point for Butler, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local [[workhouse]]. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]]—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Butler also formed the [[International Abolitionist Federation]], a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.

While investigating the effect of the Acts, Butler had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a [[Human trafficking|slave trade]] of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian ''{{lang|be|Police des Mœurs}}'', and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Butler fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', [[William Thomas Stead]], who [[Eliza Armstrong case|purchased a 13-year-old girl]] from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the [[British Raj]].

Butler [[Josephine Butler bibliography|wrote more than 90 books and pamphlets]] over the course of her career, most of which were in support of her campaigning, although she also produced biographies of [[John Grey (land agent)|her father]], her husband and [[Catherine of Siena]]. Butler's [[Christian feminism]] is celebrated by the [[Church of England]] with a [[Lesser Festival]], and by representations of her in the [[stained glass]] windows of [[Liverpool Cathedral|Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral]] and [[St Olave Hart Street|St Olave's Church]] in the [[City of London]]. Her name appears on the Reformers Memorial in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London, and [[Durham University]] named [[Josephine Butler College, Durham|one of their colleges]] after her. Her campaign strategies changed the way feminist and suffragists  conducted future struggles, and her work brought into the political milieu groups of people that had never been active before. After her death in 1906 the feminist intellectual [[Millicent Fawcett]] hailed her as "the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century".{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=1}}

==Biography==

===Early life; 1828–1850===
[[File:John Grey of Dilston Patten.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Portrait of a man, part turned toward the viewer|[[John Grey (land agent)|John Grey]], Butler's father, portrait by [[George Patten]]]]
Josephine Grey was born on 13 April 1828 at [[Milfield]], [[Northumberland]]. She was the fourth daughter and seventh child of Hannah (''{{nee}}'' Annett) and [[John Grey (land agent)|John Grey]], a land agent and agricultural expert,{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Garner|2009|p=1}}{{efn|The couple eventually had ten children, the last of whom was born in May 1836.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=13}}}} who was a cousin of the reformist British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]].{{sfn|Thompson|2004}} In 1833 John was appointed manager of the Greenwich Hospital Estates in Dilston, near [[Corbridge]], Northumberland, and the family moved to the area,{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=13}} where John acted as Lord Grey's chief political agent in Northumberland.{{sfn|Thompson|2004}} In this role John promoted his cousin's political opinions locally, including support for [[Catholic emancipation]], the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]], the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] and reform of the [[English Poor Laws|poor laws]].{{sfn|Thompson|2004}} Josephine was taught at home before completing her schooling at a [[boarding school]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] which she attended for two years.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=15}}

John treated his children equally within the home. He educated them in politics and social issues and exposed them to various politically important visitors.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=23}} John's political work and ideology had a strong influence on his daughter, as did the religious teaching she received from her mother;{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=14–15}} the family background and the circles in which she moved formed a strong social conscience and a staunch religious faith.&lt;ref name="UoL: Collection" /&gt;

At about the age of 17 Grey went through a religious crisis, which probably stemmed from an incident in which she discovered the body of a suicide while out riding.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=27}}{{efn|The man—a [[valet]] to a local gentleman—had been dismissed from his position for fathering an illegitimate child; Grey recognised him.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=27}}{{sfn|Boyd|1982|p=29}}}} She became disenchanted with her weekly church attendance, describing the local vicar as "an honest man in the pulpit&amp;nbsp;... [who] taught us loyally all that he probably himself knew about God, but whose words did not even touch the fringe of my soul's deep discontent".{{sfn|Butler|1909|p=15}} Following her crisis, Grey did not identify with any single strand of Christianity, and remained critical of the [[Anglicanism|Anglican church]].{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=22}} She later wrote that she "imbibed from childhood the widest ideas of vital Christianity, only it ''was'' Christianity. I have not much sympathy with the ''Church''{{-"}}.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=16}} She began to speak directly to God in her prayers:

{{quote|I spoke to Him in solitude, as a person who could answer.&amp;nbsp;... Do not imagine that on these occasions I worked myself up into any excitement; there was much pain in such an effort, and dogged determination required. Nor was it a devotional sentiment that urged me on. It was a desire to know God and my relation to Him.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=19}}}}

In mid-1847 Grey visited her brother in [[County Laois]], Ireland. It was at the height of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] and the first time she had come into contact with widespread suffering among the poor; she was deeply affected by her experiences{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=20}} and later recalled that "As a young girl, I had no conception of the full meaning of the misery I saw around me, yet it printed itself upon my brain and memory."{{sfn|Butler|1887|p=44}}

===Early married life; 1850–1864===
[[File:George Butler.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=George Butler in profile, wearing a suit; his hair is receding and he has a large beard|[[George Butler (1819–1890)|George Butler]], Josephine's husband]]

By 1850 Grey had grown close to [[George Butler (1819–1890)|George Butler]], a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|Fellow]] of [[Exeter College, Oxford]], whom she had met at several of the [[Ball (dance party)|balls]] hosted around [[County Durham]].{{sfn|Matthew|2004}}{{efn|Although she wrote an autobiography and a biography of her husband, Josephine never clarified where or when they first met.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=27}}}} By October that year George was sending her self-penned poems; the couple were engaged in January 1851 and married in January 1852. The Butlers set up home at 124, [[High Street, Oxford]].{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=27–28, 198}} George was a scholar and cleric and shared with his wife a commitment to [[liberal reforms]] and a love of Italian culture.{{sfn|Matthew|2004}} The couple also both had a strong Christian belief and Josephine Butler later wrote of her husband that they often "prayed together that a holy revolution might come about and that the Kingdom of God might be established on the earth".{{sfn|Butler|1892|p=102}}

In November 1852 the Butlers had a son, George Grey Butler, followed by a second, Arthur Stanley—known as Stanley—in May 1854.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=32, 39}} Butler's later memories of Oxford were of a closeted and [[Misogyny|misogynist]] community lacking in family life; she was often the only female at social gatherings and would listen in anger to what her biographer Judith Walkowitz describes as "the open acceptance of the double standard by the gentlemen of the university".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} Butler was offended by a discussion regarding the publication in 1853 of [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s novel ''[[Ruth (novel)|Ruth]]'' in which the heroine is seduced by a man of means and subsequently abandoned. Butler saw that the male conversationalists considered it natural that a "moral lapse in a woman was spoken of as an immensely worse thing than in a man";{{sfn|Butler|1892|pp=95–96}} she decided not to voice her feelings on the point but "to speak little with men, but much with God".{{sfn|Williamson|1977|p=16}} As a more practical measure she—and George—began to help many of the [[fallen woman]] of Oxford and invited some to live in their house. One case in which they were involved concerned a young woman serving a prison sentence at [[Newgate Prison]]. She had been seduced by a [[university don]] who had subsequently abandoned her; the woman had murdered her baby in despair. The Butlers contacted the governor of Newgate to arrange for her to stay in their house at the end of her sentence.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=36}}

[[File:Munro bust of Josephine Butler.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Butler in 1865, aged 36, by [[Alexander Munro (sculptor)|Alexander Munro]]]]
In 1856 Butler's health began to suffer from Oxford's damp atmosphere,{{efn|Extensive flooding of the local [[Thames Valley]] that year had been a contributory factor.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=47}}}} which exacerbated a long-standing lesion on her lung; her doctor informed her that to remain in Oxford could be fatal. As an immediate step George purchased a house in [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]], near [[Bristol]], where their third son, Charles, was born in 1857.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=47–50}} The same year, as a longer-term measure, George took the position of vice-principal at [[Cheltenham College]] and they moved to a local house.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=41}} They continued their support for liberal causes, including that of the Italian nationalist [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], although their sympathy for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] side in the [[American Civil War]] led to social ostracism; Butler considered that the resultant feeling of social isolation "was often painful&amp;nbsp;... but the discipline was useful".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=44}}

In May 1859, Butler gave birth to her final child, a daughter, Evangeline Mary, known as Eva. In August 1864 Eva fell {{convert|40|ft|m}} from the top-floor banister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=45–46}} Butler was distraught at the loss and had disturbed sleep for several years; she was unable to write about the circumstances until 30 years later.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=55}}{{sfn|Garner|2009|p=6}} The subsequent inquest gave a verdict of [[accidental death]].{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=57}}

In October 1864 Stanley contracted [[diphtheria]] while Butler was still grieving for Eva. She was suffering from depression and was in poor health. After the worst of Stanley's ailment passed, Butler decided to take him to [[Naples]] for them both to rest and recuperate. The ship in which they travelled down the west coast of Italy faced rough weather, and Butler had a physical breakdown on board from which she nearly died.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=47}}{{efn|Jordan considers that Butler was suffering a hysterical paralysis,{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=62}} while her biographer, Helen Mathers, describes it as a "psychogenic paralysis, which produces&amp;nbsp;... [a] dramatic physical manifestation of the patient's emotional suffering".{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=47}}}}

===Liverpool and the start of reform work; 1866–1869===
In January 1866 George was appointed headmaster of [[Liverpool College]], and the family moved to premises in the [[Dingle, Liverpool|Dingle]] area.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=66}} Despite the new surroundings, Butler continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.&amp;nbsp;... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool."{{sfn|Butler|1892|p=183}} She made regular visits to the [[workhouse]] at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals.{{efn|The workhouse system—brought about by the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]]—was a method of providing accommodation and employment to those unable to find work or support themselves. The employment provided was of a menial nature, including digging ditches, grinding corn or breaking stones.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=116}}{{sfn|Snell|1987|p=122}}}} She would sit with the women in the cellars—many of whom were prisoners—and pick [[oakum]] with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.{{sfn|Williamson|1977|p=18}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=53}}

[[File:Josephine Butler Building.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Large, three-floor building in a state is disrepair|Butler's hostel for women, Liverpool in a derelict condition in 2009 before its demolition]]

Just as they had done in Cheltenham, the Butlers began providing shelter in their own home for some of the women, often prostitutes in the terminal stages of [[venereal disease]]. It soon became clear that there were more women in need than they could provide for, so Butler set up a hostel, with funds from local men of means.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=60}} By Easter 1867 she had established a second, larger home, in which more appropriate work was provided, such as sewing and the manufacture of envelopes; the "Industrial Home", as she called it, was funded by the workhouse committee and local merchants.{{sfnm|1a1=Boyd|1y=1982|1p=39|2a1=Mathers|2y=2014|2p=60|3a1=Walkowitz|3y=1982a|3p=116}}

Butler campaigned for women's rights, including [[Women's suffrage|the right to the vote]] and to have a better education.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Bill]] to widen the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to include women. The petition, which was supported by the [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] and philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], was ignored and the bill became law.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=61}}

Butler considered the Liverpool hostels a stop-gap; women would continue to struggle to find employment until they had been better educated.{{sfn|Boyd|1982|p=39}} In 1867, with the [[suffragist]] [[Anne Clough]], she established the [[North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women]], which aimed to raise the status of governesses and female teachers to that of a [[profession]];{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=86}} She served as its president until 1873.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} A series of lectures, initially in towns in the north of England, began under [[James Stuart (scientist)|James Stuart]], a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Although it was thought thirty students would sign up, three hundred joined.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=87–88}} In 1868 Butler published "The Education and Employment of Women", her first pamphlet, in which she argued for access to [[higher education]] for women, and more equal access to a wider range of jobs.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} It was the first of [[Josephine Butler bibliography|90 books and pamphlets]] she wrote.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} That May she petitioned the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|senate]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] to provide examinations for women; the Cambridge Higher Examination for women was introduced the following year. Jordan notes that "much of the credit for this should go to Anne Clough, but&amp;nbsp;... Butler played a very influential part&amp;nbsp;... of the campaign."{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=96}}

At the time British law relating to marriage was based on the legal doctrine of [[coverture]], in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=70}} In April 1868 Butler and fellow suffragist [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy|Elizabeth Wolstenholme]] set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Butler remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walkowitz|1y=2004|2a1=Jordan|2y=2001|2p=88|3a1=Gordon|3a2=Doughan|3y=2014|3pp=91–92}}

===First attempt to repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts; 1869–1874===
[[File:Josephine Butler, 1876.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A woman looks to the left of the camera; she has shoulder-length hair and a large skirted dress|Butler in 1876]]

In 1869 Butler became aware of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]]. They had been introduced in 1864, 1866 and 1869 to regulate  prostitution in an attempt to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]].{{sfn|Summers|1999|p=1}} The Acts authorised the police to detain women in specific areas{{efn|Those areas covered by the Acts were 18 military stations, garrisons and seaport towns, including an area of up to 15 miles from the military installation.{{sfn|Hamilton|1978|p=14}}}}{{efn|In 1869 the "Association for the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts" was formed to campaign to extend their operation over the whole of the UK.{{sfn|Gordon|Doughan|2014|p=16}}}} considered to be prostitutes—no evidence was needed, other than the police officer's word. If a magistrate agreed, women were given genital examinations. If women were suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, they were held in a [[lock hospital]] until the condition was cured. If they refused to be examined or hospitalised they could be imprisoned, often with [[hard labour]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1978|p=14}}{{sfn|Walkowitz|1982|p=80}}

Units of plain-clothed policemen specialised in arresting suspected prostitutes; according to Jordan, the officers were "hated for their surveillance and harassment of prostitutes and working-class women&amp;nbsp;... who they treated with little regard for their legal rights".{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=107}} Women who were subjected to the examination found their names and reputations affected and, according to the historian Hilary Cashman,  "the Acts had the effect of turning them to prostitution by barring respectable ways of life to them".{{sfn|Cashman|1990|p=27}}

In September 1869 Wolstenholme met Butler in Bristol to discuss what could be done about the Acts. The National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was founded that October, but excluded women from its membership. In response, Wolstenholme and Butler formed the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] (LNA) before the end of the year.{{sfn|D'Itri|1999|p=31}}{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=110}} The organisation published a ''Ladies Manifesto'', which stated that the Acts were discriminatory on grounds of both sex and class; the Acts, it was claimed:

{{quote|not only deprived poor women of their constitutional rights and forced them to submit to a degrading internal examination, but they officially sanctioned a double standard of sexual morality, which justified male sexual access to a class of 'fallen' women and penalised women for engaging in the same vice as men.{{sfn|Walkowitz|1982|p=80}}}}

On 31 December 1869 the Ladies National Association published a statement in ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' that  it had "been formed for the purposes of obtaining the repeal of these obnoxious Acts". Among the 124 signatories  were the social theorist [[Harriet Martineau]] and the social reformer [[Florence Nightingale]].&lt;ref name="DN: LNA statement" /&gt;{{efn|In March 1870 the statement was reprinted in ''The Shield'', a weekly newspaper launched to support the repeal campaign.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=112}}}}

Butler toured Britain in 1870, travelling 3,700 miles to attend 99 meetings in the course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Butler gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=81, 84}}{{sfn|Williamson|1977|p=79}} Although she persuaded many members of her audiences,{{sfnm|1a1=Walkowitz|1y=2004|2a1=Jordan|2y=2001|2pp=113–15|3a1=Mathers|3y=2014|3pp=84–85}} she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimps]] threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=123}}&lt;ref name="Guard: Heroine" /&gt;

[[File:Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare NPG.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A seated man looks to the right of the viewer; he wears a suit and sports a neckbeard|The [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Bruce]], who set up a [[Royal Commission]] in 1871 to examine the Contagious Diseases Acts]]

At the [[Colchester by-election, 1870|1870 Colchester parliamentary by-election]] the LNA fielded a candidate against the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] candidate [[Henry Knight Storks|Sir Henry Storks]], a supporter of the Acts, who had implemented a similar regime when he commanded the British army in Malta.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=86}} Butler held several local meetings during the campaign; during one, she was chased by a group of [[brothel]] owners.{{sfn|Butler|1910|pp=27–28}} The presence of the LNA candidate split the Liberal vote and allowed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate to win the seat;{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=86}} Butler considered that "it proved to be somewhat of a turning-point in the history of our crusade".{{sfn|Butler|1910|p=25}} Because of Stork's loss at the by-election the [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Bruce]], announced a [[Royal Commission]] to examine the situation.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=127}}{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=64}} One [[Member of parliament|MP]] told Butler that

{{quote|Your manifesto has shaken us very badly in the House of Commons; a leading man in the House remarked to me, "We know how to manage any other opposition in the House or in the country, but this is very awkward for us—this revolt of the women. It is quite a new thing; what are we to do with such an opposition as this?"{{sfn|Butler|1910|p=11}}}}

The commission began work in early January 1871 and spent six months taking evidence.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=108}} After Butler testified on 18 March, a member of the committee, Liberal MP [[Peter Rylands]], stated: "I am not accustomed to religious phraseology, but I cannot give you an idea of the effect produced except by saying that the spirit of God was there".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Butler|1909|p=112}} Nevertheless, the commission's report defended the one-sided nature of the legislation, saying "...&amp;nbsp;there is no comparison to be made between prostitutes and the men who consort with them. With the one sex the offence is committed as a matter of gain; with the other it is an irregular indulgence of a natural impulse."{{sfn|Royal Commission|1871|p=17}} The report accepted the findings that the sexual health of men in the 18 areas covered by the Acts had improved. In relation to the compulsory examinations, the commission was swayed by the descriptions of "steel rape", and suggested it should be voluntary not compulsory. The commission heard significant evidence that many prostitutes were as young as 12 and recommended that the [[age of consent]] should be raised from 12 to 14. Bruce took no action on the recommendations for six months.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=97}}

In February 1872 Bruce proposed a bill that took some of the commission's recommendations,{{efn|The bill raised the age of consent to 14 and gave police powers to suppress brothels, crack down on prostitutes under the age of 16.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=98}}}} but widened the geographical scope from the 18 military centres to the whole of the UK. Although the LNA's initial stance was to accept some of the bill's clauses and try and change others, Butler rejected it in its entirety and published ''The New Era'', a 56-page pamphlet attacking the legislation; the pamphlet was re-published in serial form in ''The Shield''.{{efn|In ''The New Era'', She pointed out that Bruce's Bill was based on legislation that governed the situation in Berlin, where nearly 30,000 women were being examined; cases of [[syphilis]] has risen since the legislation had been introduced.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=99}}}} It was the first split in the repeal movement and she lost many personal supporters because of her stance. The bill faced too much opposition from the parliamentary supporters of the Contagious Diseases Acts, and was withdrawn.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=98–99}}{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=134–35}}

[[File:Josephine Butler - Pontefract meeting notice.jpg|thumb|Handbill issued prior to a talk during the [[Pontefract by-election, 1872]]]]

Two months after the withdrawal of Bruce's bill, a [[ministerial by-election]] [[Pontefract by-election, 1872|in Pontefract in 1872]] gave the LNA an opportunity for further action. Although they did not field a candidate, Butler  attended meetings [[Pontefract|in the town]]. At one LNA meeting the floor of the room had been liberally sprinkled with [[cayenne pepper]] by her opponents, making speaking difficult. After it was cleared away, her opponents set bales of straw alight in a storeroom below, which led to smoke rising through the floorboards; two members of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]—specially drafted into the town for the by-election—looked on but took no action.{{sfn|Butler|1910|pp=48–50}}{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=138–39}}{{efn|Local residents were appalled at the treatment meted out to the women, and identified 16 men who were among those responsible; all were members of the election committee of the Liberal candidate [[Hugh Childers]].{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=139–40}}}} Although the incumbent Liberal candidate, [[Hugh Childers]], was returned, there were heavy abstentions, and his vote was reduced by around 150 (from an electorate of 2,000).{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=140}}{{efn|Childers was also shocked by the events, and made efforts to apprehend those responsible. He also changed his stance on the Contagious Diseases Acts, and in an 1875 speech in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] he said the legislation failed "in the most marked degree with regard to the principle of equally treating the two sexes, which ought to be the basis for our legislation". He was one of the MPs who voted to finally repeal the Acts in 1886.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=136}}}} In December 1872 Butler met the Prime Minister, [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], when he visited Liverpool College. Although he supported the aims of the LNA, he was politically unable to back the LNA publicly, and had supported Bruce's bill.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=102}}

The [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|fall of the Liberal government in 1874]], and its replacement with [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s [[Second Disraeli ministry|Conservative administration]] meant that the repeal campaign stalled;{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} Butler called it a "year of discouragement" when there was "deep depression in the work".{{sfn|Butler|1909|p=61}} Although the LNA kept up the pressure, progress in persuading Liberal MPs to oppose the Contagious Diseases Acts was slow, and the government was implacable in its support of the measures.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=125}}

At a meeting of regional LNA branches in May, one speech focused on legislation in Europe; the meeting resolved to correspond with sister organisations on the continent. At the start of December 1874 Butler left for Paris and a tour that covered France, Italy and Switzerland, where she met with local pressure groups and civic authorities. She encountered strong support from feminist groups, but hostility from the authorities.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=146}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=111–13}} She returned from her travels at the end of February 1875.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=183}}

As a result of her experiences, in March 1875 Butler formed the British and Continental Federation for the Abolition of Prostitution (later renamed the [[International Abolitionist Federation]]),{{efn|Sources disagree about the original name. One source says it was the "British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of the Government Regulation of Vice";{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=46}} another calls it the "British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution";{{sfn|Gordon|Doughan|2014|p=25}} others call it the "British and Continental (later International) Federation for the Abolition of Governmental (later State) Regulation of Vice".{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=32}}}} an organisation that campaigned against state regulation of prostitution and for "the abolition of female slavery and the elevation of public morality among men".{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=165}}{{sfn|Summers|2006|p=216}} The Liberal MP [[James Stansfeld]]—who wished to repeal the Acts—became the federation's first general secretary;{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=183}} Butler and her friend, the Liberal MP [[Henry Wilson (Holmfirth MP)|Henry Wilson]], became joint secretaries.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=165}}

In 1878 Josephine wrote a biography of [[Catherine of Siena]], which Glen Petrie—her biographer—thought was probably her best work;{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=185}} Walkowitz considers the work provided a "historical justification for her own political activism".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} Another biographer, Helen Mathers, believes that "in emphasising that she and Catherine were born to be leaders, of both men and women,&amp;nbsp;... [Butler] made a profound contribution to feminism".{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=133}}

Butler became aware of the [[Human trafficking|slave trade]] of young women and children from England to mainland Europe in 1879.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=128}} Young girls were considered "fair game", according to Mathers, as the law allowed them to become prostitutes at the age of 13. After playing a minor role in starting an investigation into an accusation of trafficking,{{efn|Butler was contacted by Alfred Dyer, a [[Quaker]], who told her details of one case; she put him in touch with the lawyer Alexis Spingard and the men investigated the case—and others—more fully.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=128}}}} Butler became active in the campaign in May 1880, and wrote to ''The Shield'' that "the official houses of prostitution in Brussels are crowded with English minor girls", and that in one house "there are immured little children, English girls of from twelve to fifteen years of age&amp;nbsp;... stolen, kidnapped, betrayed, got from English country villages by every artifice and sold to these human shambles".{{sfn|Butler|2003|pp=21–22}} She visited Brussels where she met the mayor and local councillors and made allegations against the head of the Belgian ''{{lang|be|Police des Mœurs}}'' and his deputy as to their involvement in the trade. After the meeting she was contacted by a detective who confirmed that the senior members of the ''{{lang|be|Police des Mœurs}}'' were guilty of collusion with brothel keepers. She returned home and filed a deposition containing a copy of the statement from the detective and sent them to the ''{{lang|be|Procureur du Roi}}'' (Chief Prosecutor) and the British Home Secretary. Following an investigation in Belgium, the head of the ''{{lang|be|Police des Mœurs}}'' was removed from office, and his deputy was put on trial alongside 12 brothel owners; all were imprisoned for their roles in the trade.{{sfnm|1a1=Boyd|1y=1982|1p=49|2a1=Jordan|2y=2001|2pp=192–98|3a1=Mathers|3y=2014|3pp=129–31}}

===Second attempt to repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts; 1880–1885===
[[File:William Gladstone by Mayall, 1861.jpg|thumb|upright|a man looks directly at the viewer|[[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], a friend of the Butlers, and a tacit supporter of Butler's work]]
The [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general election]]  had removed Disraeli's Conservative party from office; they were replaced by [[Second Gladstone ministry|Gladstone's second ministry]] containing a high proportion of MPs who wanted to repeal the Acts.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=139}} As Prime Minister, Gladstone had the power to nominate candidates to vacant positions within the Church and, in June 1882, he offered George Butler the position of [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Winchester Cathedral]]. George had been considering retirement, but he and Josephine were concerned about their finances, as much of their income had been spent on the LNA and other causes Josephine supported. George accepted the appointment, and they moved into a [[grace and favour]] home near the cathedral.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=136–37}} Josephine Butler set up another hostel for women near their home.{{sfn|Williamson|1977|p=85}}

Political pressure from Liberal [[backbencher]]s, particularly [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Charles Henry Hopwood|Charles Hopwood]], led to increasing opposition to the Acts. In February 1883 Hopwood tabled a resolution in parliament: "That this House disapproves of the compulsory examination of women under the Contagious Diseases Acts", which was debated in April. MPs voted by a majority of 72 to suspend the inspections; three years later the Acts were formally repealed.{{sfnm|1a1=Strachey|1y=1928|1pp=21–22|2a1=Jordan|2y=2001|2pp=213–15|3a1=Mathers|3y=2014|3pp=141–43}}

In 1885 Butler met [[Florence Eleanor Soper|Florence Soper Booth]], the daughter-in-law of [[William Booth]], who founded  [[the Salvation Army]]. The meeting led to Butler's involvement in the campaign to expose [[child prostitution]] in Britain and its associated trade.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=217}} Along with  Booth and several supporters from the LNA, she persuaded the campaigning editor of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', [[William Thomas Stead]], to help their cause.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=149–50}}{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=224–25}}

Stead considered the best way to prove that the purchase of young girls for prostitution took place in London, was to buy a girl himself.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=250}} Butler introduced him to a former prostitute and brothel owner who was staying in her hostel. In a slum in [[Marylebone]], Stead [[Eliza Armstrong case|purchased a 13-year-old girl]] from her mother for £5, and took her to France.{{efn|The girl, Eliza Armstrong, was temporarily homed in France before being returned to Britain where she was educated at the Princess Louise Home, [[Essex]], where she was trained for a career in [[domestic service]]. Several years later she wrote to Stead thanking him for his actions. By that time she had married and had six children.{{sfn|Le Feuvre|2015|loc=3750–56}}}} In July 1885 Stead began the publication of a series of articles entitled "[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]", exposing the extent of child prostitution in London.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=225}} In the first article—which covered six pages of the ''Gazette''—Stead recounted an interview he had with [[Howard Vincent]], the head of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]]:

{{quote|"But", I said in amazement, "then do you mean to tell me that in very truth actual rapes, in the legal sense of the word, are constantly being perpetrated in London on unwilling virgins, purveyed and procured to rich men at so much a head by keepers of brothels?" "Certainly", said he, "there is not a doubt of it." "Why", I exclaimed, "the very thought is enough to raise hell." "It is true", he said; "and although it ought to raise hell, it does not even raise the neighbours."&lt;ref name="PMG: Babylon" /&gt;{{sfn|Petrie|1971|pp=244–45}}}}

On 16 July—ten days after the article was published—Butler gave a speech at a meeting at London's [[Exeter Hall]] calling for increased protection for the young and the raising of the age of consent. The following day she and George left for a holiday in Switzerland and France.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=154}} While they were away, a moribund parliamentary bill from 1883  dealing with the age of consent   was re-debated by MPs; the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] was passed on 14 August 1885.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=154}}{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=229}} The Act raised the age of consent  from 13 to 16 years of age, while the procurement of girls for prostitution by administering drugs, intimidation or fraud was made a criminal offence, as was the abduction of a girl under 18 for purposes of carnal knowledge.{{sfn|Farmer|2016|p=276}}{{efn|A late amendment to the bill by [[Henry Labouchère]]—Section 11, known as the [[Labouchere Amendment]]—created the crime of indecency between men, the first criminalisation on all acts aside from [[sodomy]], which was covered by earlier legislation. Sex between males was illegal in Britain until 1967.{{sfn|Selfe|Burke|2012|p=11}}&lt;ref name="BL: CLAA" /&gt;}} The police investigated Stead's purchase, and Butler was forced to cut her holiday short to return for questioning. Although she avoided all charges, Stead was imprisoned for three months.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=155}}

The passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Act led to the formation of purity societies, such as the [[White Cross Army]], whose aims were to force the closure of brothels through prosecution. The societies widened their remit to suppress what they considered indecent literature—including information on birth control—and the entertainment provided by the [[music hall]]s.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=158}} Butler warned against the purity societies because of their "fatuous belief that you can oblige human beings to be moral by force, and in so doing that you may in some way promote social purity".{{sfn|Walkowitz|1982a|p=252}} Her warnings went unheeded by other suffragists, and some, such as [[Millicent Fawcett]]—who was later Butler's biographer—continued to combine their activities in the feminist movement with the work for the purity societies.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}

===India, Empire and the final years; 1897–1906===
[[File:Josephine Elizabeth Butler (née Grey) by George Frederic Watts.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An elderly lady sits; she is shown in profile, looking to the left|Butler in old age, by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1894]]

Although the Contagious Diseases Acts had been repealed in the UK, the equivalent legislation was active in the [[British Raj]] in India, where prostitutes near the British [[cantonment]]s were subjected to regular forced examinations.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|pp=266–67}} The relevant law was contained in the Special Cantonments Acts which had been put on to a practical footing by Major-General [[Edward Chapman (British Army officer)|Edward Chapman]], who issued [[General order|standing orders]] for the inspection of prostitutes, and the provision of "a sufficient number of women, to take care that they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with proper houses".{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=127}}

Butler began a new campaign to have the legislation repealed, comparing the girls to slaves. After the campaign put pressure on MPs, the widespread publication of Chapman's orders led to what Mathers describes as "outrage across Britain".{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=165}} In June 1888 the House of Commons passed a unanimous resolution repealing the legislation, and the Indian government was ordered to cancel the Acts.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=243}} To circumvent the order, the [[India Office]] advised the [[Viceroy of India]] to instigate new legislation ensuring that prostitutes suspected of carrying contagious diseases had to undergo an examination or face expulsion from the cantonment.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=165}}

Towards the end of the 1880s George's health began to decline, and Butler spent increasing time looking after him.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=162–63}} They holidayed in Naples in 1889, but George contracted [[influenza]] in the [[1889–90 flu pandemic|1889–90 pandemic]]. They returned to Britain but George died on 14 March 1890;{{sfn|Matthew|2004}} Butler suspended campaigning in the aftermath of his death.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} Soon after, she left Winchester, and moved to a house in [[Wimbledon, London]], which she shared with her eldest son and his wife.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=199}}

Butler, at 62, felt she was too old to travel to India, but two American supporters visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some as young as 11—were all continuing to operate.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=169–70}} The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Butler spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=120}}

Although many of Butler's friends and supporters of shared causes spoke out against [[British Empire|British Imperial Policy]], Butler did not. She wrote that because of the work Britain had undertaken in making [[slavery]] illegal, "[w]ith all her faults, looked at from God's point of view, England is the best, and the ''least'' guilty of the nations".{{sfn|Butler|1954|p=196}} During the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), Butler published ''Native Races and the War'' (1900), in which she supported British action and its imperialist policy. In the book she took a strong line against the casual [[racism]] inherent in her countrymen's dealings with foreigners, writing:

{{quote|Great Britain will in future be judged, condemned or justified, according to her treatment of those innumerable, coloured races, heathen or partly Christianized, over whom her rule extends&amp;nbsp;... Race prejudice is a poison which will have to be cast out if the world is ever to be Christianized, and if Great Britain is to maintain the high and responsible place among the nations which has been given to her.{{sfn|Butler|1900|pp=152–53}}}}

From 1901 Butler began to withdraw from public life, resigning her positions in the campaign organisations and spending more time with her family.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=284–85, 289}} In 1903 she moved to [[Wooler]] in Northumberland, to live near her eldest son. On 30 December 1906 she died at home and was buried in the nearby village of [[Kirknewton, Northumberland|Kirknewton]].{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}

In 1907 Josephine Butler's name was added to the south side of the Reformers' Memorial in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London. The memorial was erected for those "who had defied custom and interest for the sake of conscience and public good".{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=142}} She is celebrated in the [[Church of England]] with a [[Lesser Festival]] on 30 May,&lt;ref name="CoE: 30 May" /&gt; and represented in a [[stained glass]] window in Liverpool's [[Liverpool Cathedral|Anglican Cathedral]],{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=297}} [[All Saints' Church, Cambridge]] and [[St Olave Hart Street|St Olave's Church]] in the [[City of London]].{{sfn|Beeson|2011|p=119}}

Her connections to Liverpool were memorialised in a more secular fashion. A building in the Faculty of Business and Law at [[Liverpool John Moores University]] was named "Josephine Butler House". The building, originally the first Radium Institute in the UK, in the Cultural Quarter in [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]], was built in 1867 and demolished in 2013 when the site became a car park&lt;ref name="LDE: LMU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DP: LMU" /&gt; and subsequently student housing which opened in 2015.&lt;ref name="BD: LMU" /&gt;

In 1915 the LNA merged with the International Abolitionist Federation to form the Association of Moral and Social Hygiene, which changed its name to the Josephine Butler Society in 1953. As at 2017 the society still operates; it campaigns for the protection of prostitutes and provides "protection for women and children who are criminally detained, violently abused or exploited by others who profit from their prostitution".{{sfn|Daggers|Neal|2006|p=3}}&lt;ref name="JBS: Principles" /&gt;

In 2005 [[Durham University]] named [[Josephine Butler College, Durham|Josephine Butler College]] after her, reflecting her and George's connection to the area and the university.&lt;ref name="DU: College" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DU: Butler coll" /&gt; The [[Women's Library]], at the [[London School of Economics]], holds a number of collections related to Butler. They include papers from the Ladies' National Association; more than 2,500 letters in the Josephine Butler Letter Collection; and the Josephine Butler Society Library consisting of books and pamphlets collected by the society.&lt;ref name="LSE: Library" /&gt; In 2001 [[English Heritage]] placed a [[blue plaque]] on her former residence in Wimbledon;&lt;ref name="EH: London plaque" /&gt; her former house in Cheltenham was demolished in the 1970s, but in 2002 the Cheltenham Civic Society placed a plaque on the building which now occupies the site.&lt;ref name="GE: Plaque" /&gt;

Butler was not only [[Christian feminism|a staunch feminist but a passionate Christian]],{{sfn|Summers|1999|pp=8–9}} whose favourite phrase was "God and one woman make a majority".{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=109}} Although staunchly liberal, she felt constant tensions between her liberal and feminist philosophies. According to the feminist historian [[Barbara Caine]], "Liberalism provided the framework for Butler's whole social and political approach. It was an integral part of her feminism", although it was in conflict with the liberal approach to sexuality and desire. Butler resolved the conflict through her religion.{{sfn|Caine|1993|pp=155–56}}

According to Walkowitz, Butler "pushed liberal feminism in new directions, developing theories and methods of political agitation that directly affected future campaigns for the emancipation of women".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} She developed new approaches to campaigning and moved the debate beyond discussions in middle-class houses to the public forum, bringing into the political debate women who had never been involved before.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}&lt;ref name="Guard: Heroine" /&gt; Butler's campaigning, says Walkowitz, "not only reshaped gender, class, and sexual subjectivities in late Victorian Britain but also informed national political history and state-building".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}

Numerous historians consider the success of the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts to be a milestone in the [[History of feminism|history of female emancipation]].{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} According to the political historian Margaret Hamilton, the campaign showed that "attitudes toward women were changing".{{sfn|Hamilton|1978|p=14}} The feminist scholar [[Sheila Jeffreys]] says that Butler is "one of the bravest and most imaginative feminists in history",&lt;ref name="Guard: Heroine" /&gt; while Fawcett wrote that she was "convinced that&amp;nbsp;... [Butler] should take the rank of the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century".{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=1}} Her unnamed obituarist in ''The Daily News'' considered that Butler's name

{{quote|will always rank amongst the noblest of the social reformers, the fruit of whose labours is the highest inheritance that we have. She fought with enormous courage and self-sacrifice in a battlefield where she was subjected to the fiercest antagonism&amp;nbsp;... She never faltered in her task, and it is to her in supreme that the English statute book owes the removal of one of the greatest blots that ever defaced it. Her victory marked one of the great stages of progress of woman to that equality of treatment which is the final test of a nation's civilization.&lt;ref name="DN: Obit" /&gt;}}

'''Judith Walker Andrews''' (April 26, 1826 – August 29, 1914) was an American philanthropist and social reformer.

Her brother, Dr. Clement A. Walker, was appointed in charge of the hospital for the insane in [[Boston]], and Andrews joined him there to assist in the work in which she was deeply interested. Her work in this line was of great value. From 1889, she was very much interested in the child-widows of India and formed an association to carry out the plans of [[Pandita Ramabai]]. Andrews and her co-workers managed a school at [[Puna, Gujarat]], India.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=529}}

==Early years==
Judith Walker was born in [[Fryeburg, Maine]], April 26, 1826. She was educated in Fryeburgh Academy with the intention, so common with [[New England]] girls, of becoming a teacher. Her brother. 

==Career==
Dr. Clement A. Walker, one of the first of the new school of physicians for the insane, having been appointed to the charge of the newly established hospital of the city of [[Boston]], his sister joined him there. Although never officially connected with the institution, which had already gained a reputation as a pioneer in improved administration of the work for the insane, Andrews interested herself in the details of that administration, and by her personal attention to the patients endeared herself to them. No better school of training could be found in that day for the activities to which she gave her life. She was married while in the institution, on January 15, 1857, to Joseph Andrews (died 1869), of [[Salem, Massachusetts]], who gave much time and labor to the improvement of the militia system of the commonwealth, both before and during the [[American Civil War]]. They had three children, all boys, and she attended to their education.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=27}}

Removing to Boston in 1863, she became a member of the South Congregational Church (Unitarian), and in 1876 was elected president of its ladies' organization, the South Friendly Society. Her service of 16 years in that office was only one of five such terms in the history of the society. Under the influence of its pastor, Dr. Edward Everett Hale, the South Congregational Church had wide relations both inside and outside denominational lines, and these relations brought to Andrews opportunities for religious and philanthropic work to which she was always ready to respond. While most of these, though requiring much work and thought, were of a local character, two lines of her work  made her name familiar to a large circle. Elected, in 1886, president of the Women's Auxiliary Conference, she was active in the movement to enlarge its scope and usefulness, and in 1889, when the National Alliance of Unitarian and Other Liberal Christian Women was organized, she became its first president, declining re-election in 1891. From 1889, she was a member of the Council of the National Unitarian Conference. Having become interested in the child-widows of India, through the eloquence, and later the personal friendship, of Pandita Ramabai, Andrews was largely instrumental in the formation of the Ramabai Association, to carry out the plans of Ramabai and to systematize the work of her friends throughout the country. To the executive committee of that association, of which Andrews was chairman from the beginning, was entrusted the oversight of the management of the school for child-widows, the Sharada Sadana at Poona and the settlement of the many delicate questions arising from a work so opposed to the customs though fortunately not to the best traditions, of India.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=28}} She died August 29, 1914, in Boston, and was buried at Harmony Grove Cemetery, in Salem.

'''Legion''' is a [[hacktivist]] group that has attacked some rich and powerful people in India by hacking their [[twitter]] handlers. The group claims to have access to many email servers in India and has the encryption keys used by Indian banks over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bearak|first1=Max|title=The man hacking India’s rich and powerful talks motives, music, drugs and next targets|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/12/the-man-hacking-indias-rich-and-powerful-talks-motives-music-drugs-and-next-targets|website=Washington Post|date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarkhel|first1=Aritra|last2=Alawadhi|first2=Neha|title=Hacker group Legion calls Indian banking system deeply flawed|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/security/hacker-group-legion-calls-indian-banking-system-deeply-flawed/articleshow/55952105.cms|website=The Economic Times|date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Legion came in news when it launched its series of attacks starting with [[Rahul Gandhi]], the current president of [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rahul Gandhi’s official Twitter handle hacked, posts profane content|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/rahul-gandhi-twitter-hacked-abuse-reactions-4403716|website=The Indian Express|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports say that not only Rahul's twitter handler was hacked but his mail server was also hacked. The very next day, INC's twitter handler was also hacked and tweeted irrelevant content. The group then hacked twitter handlers of [[Vijay Mallya]], [[Barkha Dutt]] and [[Ravish Kumar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalists Barkha Dutt, Ravish Kumar's Twitter accounts hacked by Legion|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/journalists-barkha-dutt-ravish-kumars-twitter-accounts-hacked-by-legion-3150546.html|website=Firstpost|date=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary A. Ahrens''', née Jones (December 29, 1836 – ?), was an English-born American teacher, lawyer, and social reformer.

==Family and education==
Born Mary A. Jones in Staffordshire, England, she was the daughter of William H. Jones, a clergyman, and Ann (Brown) Jones.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt;&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; When she was fifteen, the family move to America and settled in Illinois.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt;

She was married twice. In 1857 she married Philip Fellows,&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; with whom she had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; In 1886, she married Louis Ahrens, a lawyer and artist.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

==Career==
After raising her children, Ahrens became a teacher of black Americans, who had been [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipated]] not long before.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; 

Not long after her second marriage, Ahrens decided to study law.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; She erolled in the Chicago [[Union College of Law]], graduating with honors in 1889.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; Her primary clients were women and children and the poor.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; She was a strong advocate for [[women's suffrage]], pursuing this goal through public talks, through legal efforts, and through activity in various organizations.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt;&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; She is credited with helping to open school elections to women in Illinois.&lt;ref name=lippincott/&gt; She served as chair of the Woman's School Suffrage Association of Cook County and as vice-president of the Protective Agency for Women and Children.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt;

In 1890, she became the founding president of the Chicago Immediate Aid Society, which opened a relief station offering meals and lodging to homeless men as well as helping them find work.&lt;ref name=visher/&gt; Recognizing a similar need among women, in early 1894 she founded the Mary A. Ahrens Mission, a home for destitute women in Chicago.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;&lt;ref name=visher/&gt;

Her date of death is uncertain, but she was alive when her husband Louis died in October 1907.&lt;ref name=cln/&gt;

==Family and early life==
Mary Elliott, daughter of Benjamin Franklin Elliott and Nancy (Kegley) Elliott, was born April 27, 1867 in a part of [[Carter County, Kentucky]] that would later become [[Elliott County, Kentucky]]. After completing her schooling at [[University of Charleston]] in West Virginia and the [[University of Kentucky]], she was a public school teacher.&lt;ref name="The Kentucky Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The National Women's History Museum"/&gt;

===Family===

The Flanery family moved to [[Pikeville, Kentucky]] in 1896 for Harvey to work for Northern Coal and Coke as an attorney.&lt;ref name="The Kentucky Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Collected Works of Effie Waller Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Effie Waller|title=The Collected Works of Effie Waller Smith|editor=David Deskins|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|year=1991|series=Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers|pages=3–26, |isbn=0-19-506197-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A69tCaq_t5UC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22mary+elliott+flanery%22&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mary%20elliott%20flanery%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey and Mary had five children together; Sue, Merle, Dawn, Dew, and John.&lt;ref name="The Kentucky Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Journalism and literary interests==
While residing in Pikeville, Mary Flanery began a career as a writer. From 1904 until 1926, she worked as a journalist for the Ashland  Daily Independent.&lt;ref name="The Kentucky Encyclopedia"/&gt; She wrote a column called "Impressions of Kentucky's Legislature," and she advocated for legislation as a means for social reform.

Flanery "discovered" female African-American poet Effie Waller Smith, who live and worked in Pike County, Kentucky.&lt;ref name="The Collected Works of Effie Waller Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="State's lost poet deserves honors"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hfMrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q2oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2793,100506&amp;dq=mary+elliott+flanery&amp;hl=en|title=State's lost poet deserves honors|date=1 May 1989|work=Kentucky New Era |pages=7C|accessdate=12 March 2010|location=Hopkinsville, Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights advocate==
Flanery was a member of the Kentucky Equal Right Association, and actively worked for women to have the right to vote. She worked for to improve the lives of women through reform of suffrage, marriage, and divorce laws.&lt;ref name="The National Women's History Museum"/&gt;

==Kentucky Legislator==
After women gained suffrage in Kentucky, in 1921, Flanery ran as the Democratic party candidate for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representative from the 89th District representing [[Boyd County, Kentucky]] and won by a 250-vote margin. When Flanery took her seat in the lower house of the General Assembly in January 1922, she was the first female state legislator elected in Kentucky and the first female legislator elected south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]].&lt;ref name="The Kentucky Encyclopedia"/&gt;

As an legislator, Flanery continued her advocacy for women's rights. She urged her colleagues to change legislation about marriage and divorce, and to implement the federal Shepard-Towner Maternity Act, a progressive era program that provided medical care to pregnant women and their children.&lt;ref name="The National Women's History Museum"/&gt;

Flanery's time in the General Assembly ended with an unsuccessful campaign for Secretary of State in 1923. She was defeated by another female trailblazer, [[Emma Guy Cromwell]], who was the first female to hold a statewide office. Flanery stayed active in politics and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1924.&lt;ref name="The Kentucky Encyclopedia"/&gt;

The '''mature minor doctrine''' is an American term for the [[statutory]], [[regulatory]], or [[common law]] policy accepting that an [[emancipated minor|unemancipated minor]] [[patient]] may possess the [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] to choose or reject a particular [[health care]] [[Therapy|treatment]], sometimes without the knowledge or agreement of parents, and should be permitted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''West's encyclopedia of American law'', Volume 8, West Publishing, 1998, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; It is now generally considered a form of patients [[rights]]; formerly, the '''mature minor rule''' was largely seen as protecting [[health care providers]] from [[criminal]] and civil [[cause of action|claims]] by parents of minors at least 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Legal issues in pediatrics and adolescent medicine'' by Angela Roddey Holder, Yale University Press, 1985, page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions may [[codification (law)|codify]] an age of medical consent, accept the judgment of [[licensure|licensed]] providers regarding an individual minor, or accept a formal [[court decision]] following a request that a patient be designated a mature minor, or may rely on some combination. For example, patients at least 16 may be assumed to be mature minors for this purpose,&lt;ref&gt;"Definitions", ''USLegal.com'', [http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/mature-minor-doctrine/ Retrieved 2011-05-16], "Mature minor doctrine is a legal principle which... has been consistently applied in cases where the minor is sixteen years or older"&lt;/ref&gt; patients aged 13 to 15 may be designated so by licensed providers, and pre-teen patients may be so-designated after evaluation by an [[Government agency|agency]] or [[court]]. The mature minor doctrine is sometimes connected with enforcing [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|confidentiality]] of minor patients from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mature Minor Rule: Teens and patient confidentiality'', Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County, [http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/personal/famplan/providers/matureminor.aspx Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==
In the United States, a typical statute lists: ''"Who may consent [or withhold consent for] surgical or medical treatment or procedures."''
:"...Any unemancipated minor of sufficient intelligence to understand and appreciate the consequences of the proposed surgical or medical treatment or procedures, for himself."&lt;ref&gt;''Mississippi Code'', [http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm Retrieved 2011-05-13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125628/http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''2010 Arkansas Code'', [http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-20/subtitle-2/chapter-9/subchapter-6/20-9-602/ Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical emancipation==
{{See also|Emancipation of minors}}
By definition, a "mature minor" has been found to have the [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to make serious medical decisions alone. By contrast, "medical emancipation" formally releases children from some parental involvement requirements but does not necessarily grant that decision making to children themselves. Pursuant to statute, several jurisdictions grant medical emancipation to a minor who has become [[pregnant]] or requires [[reproductive health|sexual-health]] services, thereby permitting medical treatment without parental consent and, often, confidentiality from parents. A limited [[legal guardian|guardianship]] may be appointed to make medical decisions for the medically emancipated minor and the minor may not be permitted to refuse or even choose treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''Children and the Law'' by Douglas E. Abrams and Sarah H. Ramsey, West Group, 2003, page 769&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One early U.S. case of significance, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10967297783373086168&amp;q=431+P.2d+719.&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Smith v. Seibly''], 72 Wn.2d 16, 431 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 719 (1967), before the [[Washington Supreme Court]], establishes precedent on the mature minor doctrine. The plaintiff, Albert G. Smith, an 18-year-old married father, was suffering from [[myasthenia gravis]], a progressive disease. Because of this, Smith expressed concern that his wife might become burdened in caring for him for their existing child  and possibly for additional children. On March 9, 1961, while still 18, Smith requested a [[vasectomy]]. His doctor required [[Informed consent|written consent]], which Smith provided, and the [[surgery]] was performed. Later, after reaching Washington's statutory [[age of majority]], then 21, the doctor was sued by Smith, who now claimed that he had been a minor and thus unable to grant surgical or medical consent. The Court rejected Smith's argument: "Thus, age, intelligence, maturity, training, experience, economic independence or lack thereof, general conduct as an adult and freedom from the control of parents are all factors to be considered in such a case [involving consent to surgery]."

The court further quoted another recently decided case, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18043554202269328547&amp;q=422+P.2d+812&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Grannum v. Berard''], 70 Wn.2d 304, 307, 422 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 812 (1967): "The mental capacity necessary to consent to a surgical operation is a question of fact to be determined from the circumstances of each individual case." The court explicitly stated that a minor may grant surgical consent even without formal emancipation.

Especially since the 1970s, older pediatric patients sought to make autonomous decisions regarding their own treatment and sometimes sued successfully to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"Affirming the Decisions Adolescents Make about Life and Death" by Robert F. Weir and Charles Peters, ''Hastings Center Report'', Vol 27 No. 6, November–December 1997, Hastings Center, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; The decades of accumulated evidence tended to demonstrate that children are capable of participating in medical decision-making in a meaningful way;&lt;ref&gt;"Ethical problems in pediatric critical care: Consent" by Christine A. Zawistowski and Joel E. Frader, ''Critical Care Medicine'', Vol 31 Issue 5, May 2003, page S407-S410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors Should Have the Right to Refuse Life-Sustaining Medical Treatment" by Melinda T. Derish and Kathleen Vanden Heuvel, ''The Journal of Law Medicine and Ethics'', Vol 28 Issue 2, June 2000, pages 109-124&lt;/ref&gt; and legal and medical communities have demonstrated an increasing willingness of formally affirming decisions made by young people, even regarding life and death.&lt;ref&gt;"Children's Competence to Participate in Healthcare Decisions" by Susan M. Beidler and Susan B. Dickey, ''JONA's Healthcare Law Ethics and Regulation'', Vol 3 Issue 3, September 2001, page 80-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs have repeatedly influenced a patient's decision to choose treatment or not. In a case in 1989 in Illinois, [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/you-must-be-this-old-to-die/384303/ a 17 year old female Jehovah's Witness] was permitted to refuse necessary life saving treatments.

In 1990, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Patient Self-Determination Act]]; even though key provisions apply only to patients over age 18,&lt;ref&gt;''The Patient Self-Determination Act: An Early Look at Implementation'' by Mathy Mezey and Beth Latimer, ''Hastings Center Report'', January–February 1993, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; the legislation advanced patient involvement in decisionmaking. The [[West Virginia Supreme Court]], in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14842078072813819970&amp;q=422+SE2d+827&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Belcher v. Charleston Area Medical Center''], 422 [[South Eastern Reporter|S.E.2d]] 827, 188 W.Va. 105 (1992), defined a "mature minor" exception to [[parental consent]], according consideration to seven factors to be weighed regarding such a minor: age, ability, experience, education, exhibited judgment, conduct, and appreciation of relevant risks and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors and Emancipated Minors", Health Sciences Center, West Virginia University, [http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf Retrieved 2011-08-04] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226055543/http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf |date=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withholding of consent==
{{See also|Informed refusal}}

===United States===
In the United States, [[bodily integrity]] has long been considered a [[Natural and legal rights|common law right]]; the United States Supreme Court, in 1891's ''[[Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford]]'', found, "No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable [[Rational-legal authority|authority of law]]." The Supreme Court in 1990 (''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'') allowed that "constitutionally protected [[Claim rights and liberty rights|liberty interest]] in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred" in the ''[[Due process#The U.S. Constitution|Due Process]] Clause'' of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], but the Court refrained from explicitly establishing what would have been a newly enumerated right. Nevertheless, lower courts have increasingly held that competent patients have the right to refuse any treatment for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Towards the right to be killed?" by Trudo Lemmens, ''British Medical Bulletin'', Vol 52 No. 2, British Council, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] interpreted the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to have already adopted major aspects of mature minor doctrine, concluding,
:Although the United States Supreme Court has not broadened this constitutional right of minors beyond [[Abortion in the United States|abortion cases]], the [Illinois] [[appellate court]] found such an extension "inevitable." ...Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has not held that a [[Constitutional right|constitutionally based right]] to [[Informed refusal|refuse medical treatment]] exists, either for adults or minors. ...[U.S. Supreme Court] cases do show, however, that no "[[bright line]]" age restriction of 18 is tenable in restricting the rights of mature minors, [thus] mature minors may possess and exercise rights regarding medical care... If the evidence is clear and convincing that the minor is mature enough to appreciate the consequences of her actions, and that the minor is mature enough to exercise the judgment of an adult, then the mature minor doctrine affords her the common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment [including life and death cases, with some considerations].&lt;ref&gt;''In re E.G.'', 549 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.2d]] 322, 133 Ill. 2d 98, Supreme Court of Illinois, November 13, 1989, [http://il.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19891113_0001777.IL.htm/qx Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing case of Z.M is being heard in Maryland regarding the minor's right to refuse chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.state.md.us/cosappeals/pdfs/201610schedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Connecticut, Cassandra C. a seventeen year old was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to receive treatment. The court decided that Cassandra was not mature enough to make medical decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://campbelllawobserver.com/the-choice-is-not-always-yours-a-minors-right-to-make-medical-decisions/|title=The Choice is Not Always Yours: A Minor’s Right to Make Medical Decisions|newspaper=Campbell Law Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling in ''[[A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)|A.C. v. Manitoba]]''&lt;!-- This article will be added; please do not "fix" redlink.---&gt; [2009] SCC 30 (CanLII) found that children ''may'' make life and death decisions about their medical treatment. In the majority opinion, [[Puisne Justice|Justice]] [[Rosalie Abella]] wrote:
:"The result of this [decision] is that young people under 16 will have the right to demonstrate mature medical decisional capacity. ...If, after a careful analysis of the young person’s ability to exercise mature and independent judgment, the court is persuaded that the necessary level of maturity exists, the young person’s views ought to be respected."
A "dissenting"&lt;ref&gt;That is, dissenting to the disposition of this specific case rather than the larger point of law&lt;/ref&gt; opinion by Justice [[Ian Binnie]] would have gone further:
:"At common law, proof of capacity entitles the “mature minor” to exercise personal autonomy in making medical treatment decisions free of parental or judicial control. ...[A] young person with capacity is entitled to make the treatment decision, not just to have ‘input’ into a [[judge]]’s consideration of what the judge believes to be the young person’s best interests."&lt;ref&gt;"A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)", Supreme Court of Canada, June 26, 2009, Docket 31955, [http://www.lewisday.ca/ldlf_files/pdf/AC.pdf Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;
Analysts note that the Canadian decision merely requires that younger patients be permitted a ''[[Hearing (law)|hearing]]'', and still allows a judge to "decide whether or not to order a medical procedure on an unwilling minor".&lt;ref&gt;"Charter Offers No Protection from Forced Blood Transfusion for Young Jehovah’s Witness" by Jim Young, Center for Constitutional Studies, July 2, 2009, [http://www.law.ualberta.ca/centres/ccs/news/?id=313 Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10967">'''Medical paternalism''' is a set of attitudes and practices in [[medicine]] in which a [[physician]] determines that a [[Patient|patient's]] wishes or choices should not be honored. These practices were current through the early to mid 20th century, and were characterised by a [[paternalistic]] attitude, [[Surrogate decision-maker|surrogate decision-making]] and a lack of respect for patient [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name="LibState"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft9w1009qr/ | title=Just Doctoring:  Medical Ethics in the Liberal State | publisher=University of California Press | author=Brennan, Troyen | year=1991 | pages=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost exclusively undertaken with the intention of benefiting the patient, although this is not always the case.  In the past, paternalism was considered an absolute medical necessity, as there was little to no public understanding of medical procedures and practices.  However, in recent years, paternalism has become limited and blind faith in doctors' decisions has come to be frowned upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicalprotection.org/uk/advice-booklets/mps-guide-to-ethics---a-map-for-the-moral-maze/chapter-1---ethics-values-and-the-law/the-end-of-paternalism|title=The end of paternalism|last=MPS|website=www.medicalprotection.org|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, paternalistic medicine was increasingly seen as inappropriate in the West with guidance from professional bodies such as the [[General Medical Council]] indicating that it is ethically unsupportable.&lt;ref name="GMC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/consent_guidance_common_law.asp | title=Consent guidance: Legal Annex - Common Law | publisher=General medical Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 18th century, medical paternalism was considered necessary.  It was believed that only a doctor could properly understand symptoms and draw useful conclusions.  During this period, the prevailing consensus was that disease was nothing more than symptoms.  This meant that the individual history of the patient didn't matter in providing care, so the patient him or herself was irrelevant in the medical encounter.  Thus it was deemed necessary that physicians make decisions for patients. This view of paternalism was only encouraged by the rise of hospitals in the later 18th century.  Because patients in hospitals were often sick and disabled, the view of them as passive recipients of medical care only became more prevalent.

The movement away from paternalism can be traced back to the relationship between early psychologists and their patients. In particular, [[Josef Breuer]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] urged that importance be placed on communication with and understanding of the patient.  This sharply contrasted the view of patients as passive, and placed them at the center of the medical encounter.  These practices also treated patients as unique, instead of simply being a collection of symptoms to be fixed by a paternalistic doctor.

In 1956, [[Thomas Szasz|Szasz]] and Hollender&lt;ref&gt;Szasz, T. S., &amp; Hollender, M. H. (1956). "The Basic Models of the Doctor-Patient Relationship." ''Archives of Internal Medicine'', 97, 585–592.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced three models of paternalism to the medical community, thereby legitimizing the view that doctors did not necessarily have to dominate patients.  The models are as follows:
* ''Activity—passivity'' refers to the traditional version of paternalism, in which the doctor treats the patient as one who cannot or should not make decisions.  This relationship is similar to that of a parent and child.  Treatment is performed "irrespective of the patient's contribution and regardless of outcome."  This model is considered justified in emergency situations in which there is no time to consider the patient's preferences or contributions.
* ''Guidance—co-operation'' is a relationship used in more long-term situations.  The doctor provides instructions to the patient, to which the patient is expected to comply.  The name comes from the expectation that the physician will guide the patient, who will co-operate, but who retains their individuality.  
* ''Mutual participation'' involves the physician making it clear that he or she is not infallible and does not always know what is best.  This model is more of a partnership, in which the doctor helps the patient to help him or herself.  This model is often employed in cases of chronic disease or pain, in which the patient can have a higher degree of freedom and be more independent of the doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaba|first=R.|date=February 2007|title=The evolution of the doctor-patient relationship|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919106000094|journal=International Journal of Surgery|volume=5|pages=57–65|doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strong vs. weak paternalism ==
Strong and weak paternalism (sometimes referred to as limited and extended paternalism) are two philosophies regarding when it is appropriate for a doctor to ignore a patient's wishes. The fundamental difference lies in the patient's capacity to make well-informed decisions for themselves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Should Decide?: Paternalism in Health Care|last=Childress|first=James F.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-503127-X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} Weak (or limited) paternalism refers to a situation in which the physician will only disobey the patient's requests if the patient cannot demonstrate that their choices are voluntary and well-informed. As such, even if the doctor disagrees with the patient's desire, he or she will not intervene as long as the patient is of sound mind. Strong (or extended) paternalism involves a doctor superseding a patient's requests in cases where the doctor has determined a better course of action, even when the patient's requests are made voluntarily. These cases typically arise when the physician has determined that a patient's decision is unreasonable because of the risks involved, or potential costs to the patient's well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medical Responsibility: Paternalism, Informed Consent, and Euthanasia|last=Robison|first=Wade L.|last2=Pritchard|first2=Michael S.|publisher=The HUMANA Press|year=1979|isbn=0-89603-007-5|location=Clifton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}

== Legality ==
Due to the subjective nature of when and to what extent paternalism is necessary, physicians who engage in paternalism may find themselves in a complicated legal situation.  Throughout history there have been many cases in which a patient is reported to have made a well-informed choice (while of sound mind) to opt for a medically improper treatment, or one that is very costly to their well-being.  If the doctor does not take a paternalistic stance, and instead goes through with the patient's wishes, the question arises as to whether malpractice occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/map/PaternalisminMedicine.html|title=Public Health Law Map - Beta 5.7|last=Richards|first=Edward|date=2009-04-19|website=The LSU Medical and Public Health Law Site|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There exists an expectation of doctors to provide as much information as is appropriate to their patients, as well as an expectation that they do not keep anything relevant secret.  This creates a difficult legal situation in which a decision has to be made about what the correct amount of information is, and how best to present it.  For example, a patient may read everything available to them and ultimately decide on undergoing a procedure with a 95% survival rate.  However, that same patient may not choose the same procedure if it is presented as carrying a 5% risk of dying.  As such, in cases in which things go awry it is the courts' responsibility to determine whether the physician is at fault, and whether he or she should have ignored the patient's requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=Lisa|date=2015-08-13|title=The Paternalism Preference — Choosing Unshared Decision Making|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1508418|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=373|issue=7|pages=589–592|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1508418|issn=0028-4793|pmid=26267618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with euthanasia ==
In many cases, particularly countries in which [[voluntary euthanasia]] is illegal, physicians must exercise medical paternalism by not respecting patients' wishes to die.  There are contrasting views on whether this constitutes weak or strong paternalism.  One argument is that weak paternalism allows the physician to stay completely hands-off.  If the patient is in a sound state of mind and the doctor can reasonably guess what they desire, so there is no need for further action.  They do not need to keep the patient alive, nor do they need to allow the patient to die.  In this sense, one could argue that weak medical paternalism has no contradictions with allowing a patient to undergo voluntary euthanasia.

The relationship between strong medical paternalism and euthanasia is slightly more complicated.  There are questions of a philosophical nature that must be addressed.  For example, a strong paternalist would have to determine whether it is always objectively bad for a human to die, even if that human could prove that it was their desire to do so.  In these cases, a physician may defer to morality or religion in order to make a decision.  They would perhaps present the argument that even if a person wished to die, it would be an irrational desire and they should not indulge it.  However, in the absence of these factors, it is possible for strong paternalism to be compatible with voluntary euthanasia.  This would require the patient to make it clear that he or she would not be losing anything of value to them by dying, i.e. fundamentally disconnecting life from goodness.  For example, if a patient learns that he or she would be in constant pain for the rest of his or her life, it is not irrational to honor their wishes to die.  In these cases, some argue, even a strong paternalism does not justify prolonging the patient's life, because the physicians actions would not truly be for the patient's own good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Liberty and Medical Control|last=Häyry|first=Heta|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|year=1998|isbn=1 84014 572 2|location=|pages=28–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Myth of Redemptive Violence''' is an archetypal [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] in [[literature]], especially in [[empire|imperial]] cultures.  One of the oldest versions of this story is the [[creation myth]] of [[Babylon]] (the [[Enûma Elish]]) from around 1250 B.C.  [[Walter Wink]] coined the term as part of an analysis of its impact on modern culture and its role in maintaining oppressive power structures in his book ''The Powers That Be''.

==Narrative and effect==
While contrasting the Enûma Elish with the [[Genesis creation myth]] found in the [[Book of Genesis]], Wink examines the psychological effects of each phase of the story.  He asserts that every phase of the narrative serves to reinforce the ideology of the status quo and convince us to perpetuate the ruling power structure:

===Primal chaos===
The primacy of [[Tiamat]] suggests that chaos and evil are the original and natural state of the universe.  This can be used to convince us to fear and oppose any threat to the current order, under the assumption that things can only get worse.  Superheroes especially have dark origins (for example, the murder of [[Bruce Wayne]]'s parents and the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|planet Krypton]]), and the pervasiveness of evil is depicted by the resurrection of villains in [[horror movies]] and [[cartoons]], the exaggerated presence of violent crime in [[news]] coverage, and the overwhelming number and variety of bad creatures in [[The Lord of the Rings]].

===Tammuz===
Tiamat and her allies oppress the other gods, who, at first, seem powerless to resist.  This acknowledges the effectiveness of alternative systems, and gives us the guilty pleasure of vicariously harming our "betters" and breaking their rules.  However, all this is constrained by the exaggerated flaws of the antagonists, which foreshadow their failure and make us ashamed to identify with them.  [[Horror films]] tend to emphasize this part of the narrative to the extreme, whereas [[superhero]] stories often marginalize it.

===Heroism===
[[Marduk]] offers to defeat Tiamat in exchange for absolute rule over the remaining gods, and they all agree.  This elevates "[[might makes right]]" to a contract made at the beginning of the universe.  People are inclined to identify with the hero because of his privileges and his good attributes, and to sympathize with any subsequent oppression.  Modern examples include [[James Bond]]'s license to kill, the gold mine given to [[Doc Savage]]'s father, Friday's loyalty to [[Robinson Crusoe]], the brazen dishonesty of [[Jedi]] knights, the extremes of [[Jack Bauer]], etc.

===Triumph===
Marduk slays his enemies in creative, gory, and intricate ways, then goes on to enslave their underlings.  This shows that good prevails and evil suffers; the corollary to this is that those who prevail are good.  This gives us the catharsis of vengeance and indignation.  Once again we can sadistically enjoy a character's suffering, but this time in a sanctioned, acceptable context.  The spectacular downfall and glorious victory prompt us to reject the antagonist and  reaffirm our commitment to the winning party, respectively.  [[Action movies]] and [[video games]] tend to have a decisive final battle.  An opposition leader's death scene often includes ridiculously thorough destruction of his or her body, property, and/or organization, such as [[Julius No|Dr. No]] drowning in the core of his nuclear reactor, which then melts down.

===Redemption===
Marduk makes the world from Tiamat's corpse and humanity from the blood of [[Kingu]].  This leaves us with the message that our prosperity and even our very existence required past violence and destruction; as Wink puts it, "We are the outcome of deicide."  This helps justify recent and ongoing violence by appealing to our self-interest.  The death or defeat of the antagonist tends to be immediately followed by an idyllic happy ending in simple, violent plots of all stripes.  Current examples include the [[Ewok]] percussion instrument made from [[Imperial stormtrooper|Storm Trooper]] and other Imperial helmets (or heads) at the end of [[Return of the Jedi]], and the brain surgery Doc Savage uses to turn criminals into productive citizens.

==Opposing views==
Traditionally, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have noted that myths transmit elements of culture and shape the listener's worldview without making value judgments as to the merit of a given culture or the validity of its worldview.  Wink's analysis is predicated on the notion that Babylonian society and pagan religion, as well as Western society and popular culture, are intrinsically less valid than his notion of first century [[Christian]] society and "pure" [[monotheism]].

It has also been postulated that the creation story of Genesis was developed in reaction to earlier stories, including the Enûma Elish, since the stories share common elements that other creation beliefs lack.  Adherents of [[meme]] theory see the similarity as more fundamental: each story advocates a certain power structure, which has led people in power to support the story that favors them, often oppressively and often using violence.  Whether or not a myth directly advocates violence and oppression, it may still foster misery and destruction.

== The Two Brothers ==

{{Cleanup|section|reason=needs proper citations &amp; formatting|date=October 2014}}

The [[Tale of Two Brothers]] is an ancient Egyptian story from around the 13th century BCE. The narrative is preserved on the [[Papyrus D'Orbiney]]. [Tale of Two Brothers] which had belonged to Seti II (1209-1205 B.C.) of the nineteenth Egyptian dynasty when he was crown prince [William Matthew Flinders Petrie, Egyptian Tales: Translated from the Papyri, 1895, p.&amp;nbsp;66 ] and may have been a political satire based in part on his own difficulties with his half brother, the usurper Amenmesse[J. H. Breasted Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Three, §§ 239ff. ], but the historical facts concerning this period are so uncertain as to render such a conclusion speculative. The text has similarities to the story of Joseph in the house of Potiphar, in Genesis 39:1-20, however the relation between the two texts is unclear, if, indeed, there is one.[Shaw, Ian. &amp; Nicholson, Paul. The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, p.&amp;nbsp;54. The British Museum Press, 1995] Further elements of the story seem to be derived from the myths concerning Osiris' death and resurrection.[Erman, Adolph. Life in Ancient Egypt. p.&amp;nbsp;379. Dover Publications, 1971. ] The protagonists Anpu and Bata both bear names of gods of the 17th nome of Upper Egypt.

===Synopsis===
Bata lives with his married brother Anpu. One day, when Anpu is not at home, his wife tries to seduce Bata, and, having been repelled, accuses Bata of having made advances towards her. Anpu grows angry and wants to kill his younger brother who flees. Pre-Harakhte saves him by creating a body of water full of crocodiles between him and his brother. Bata tells his brother what has occurred and, as proof of his sincerity, cuts off his genitals which are swallowed by a fish. Anpu returns home and kills his wife. Bata lives alone in the wilderness until the gods create a wife for him. Bata loves her very much and reveals to her that his heart is hidden in a pine. Pharaoh, on learning of her existence has her brought to his court. She tells him Bata's secret and he has the pine cut down, killing Bata. Anpu goes to look for his brother, and after finding his body he searches for his heart and finds it after years of searching. Bata is revived and wants to take revenge on his wife. He changes himself into a beautiful bull and his brother takes him to Pharaoh. Bata reveals himself to his wife who has him killed. Two drops of his blood are spilled and from them grow two persea trees, incarnations of Bata. His wife has them felled, but a splinter of their wood enters her mouth, she swallows it and becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, a reincarnation of Bata, who is acknowledged as the Pharaoh's heir. When Pharaoh dies and he becomes king, he has the queen tried and killed.

The cost to a person's future can be very high if something undesirable is found by the increasing number of education institutions and employers using the internet as a tool to vet potential students or employees."|source=— David Smith, deputy commissioner for the [[Information Commissioner's Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3355280/Facebook-posts-could-threaten-your-career.html|title=Facebook posts 'could threaten your career'|last=Hope|first=Christopher|date=23 November 2007|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A survey in 2007 found that half of UK employees would be outraged if their employers looked up information about them on social networking sites, and 56% thought it would be unethical. Employer surveys found that between approximately 20-67% of employers conduct [[internet search]]es, including of social networking sites, and that some have turned down applicants as a result of their searches.&lt;ref name=cyber/&gt; 21% of [[Higher education|colleges and universities]] surveyed said they looked at the social networking of prospective students, usually for those applying for [[scholarships]] and other limited awards and programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infotoday.com/it/sep09/Greenwood.shtml|title=Facebook: The Next Great Vetting Tool?|last=Greenwood|first=Bill|date=September 2009|work=Information Today|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective political appointees to the [[Obama administration]] were asked to list all their [[blog]] posts, any [[email]]s, [[text message]]s, and [[instant message]]s that could suggest a [[conflict of interest]] or public source of embarrassment, the URLs of any sites that featured them in a personal or professional capacity, and all of their online aliases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/04/promiscuous-online-culture.html|title=Promiscuous online culture and the vetting process|last=Croll|first=Alistair|date=29 April 2010|work=O'Reilly Radar|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent research findings conducted with recruiters published in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkelaar|first=Brenda L|date=2017-01-31|title=Different ways new information technologies influence conventional organizational practices and employment relationships: The case of cybervetting for personnel selection|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0018726716686400|journal=Human Relations|language=en|volume=70|issue=9|pages=1115–1140|doi=10.1177/0018726716686400|issn=0018-7267}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed three primary function of a cybervetting process:

* Screening - Process considered analogous to conventional background check and résumé analysis;
* Efficiency - A more effective way to gather information from a candidate than the conventional process;
* Relational - Analysis of a candidate relationship and behavior through social network posts.

The cybervetting is so contradictory that most of the participants didn’t acknowledge its usage regardless the familiarity they have with this theme. Only a few number of participants talked openly about having cybervetting current candidates.

==Legal position==
Legal experts have warned human resources departments about vetting prospective employees online, due to the possibility of discrimination and the unreliability of this information.&lt;ref name=dilemma&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/06/24/46448/vetting-through-social-networking-sites-weekly-dilemma.html|title=Vetting through social networking sites: weekly dilemma|last=Wort|first=Jo|date=24 June 2008|work=Personnel Today|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the UK Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety argued that it was "possibly illegal, but certainly unethical". While the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] advised that just looking at information on someone's social networking profiles would not be illegal, an employment law specialist noted that under the [[Data Protection Act 1998]], processing and storing the information or using it to make discriminatory decisions could be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3355337/Facebook-vetting-could-be-illegal.html|title=Facebook vetting 'could be illegal'|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=27 November 2007|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Age discrimination]] might result from such a practice, due to the age profile of users of social networking sites.&lt;ref name=dilemma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Business/Workplace-Twittering.htm|title=Workplace Twittering|date=16 June 2009|work=Cambridge News|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failed candidates may be able to use discrimination legislation to ask about vetting operations and even ask for IT records to check access to social networks.&lt;ref name=friend/&gt; In the US, vetting using social networking sites risks breaching the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), which requires employers to gain the consent of applicants before doing a [[background check]], state laws that limit the consideration of off-duty conduct in making employment decisions, and any searches risk breaching prohibitions against commercial use contained in the [[terms of service]] of the social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shrm.org/Publications/hrmagazine/editorialcontent/pages/1007sr-zeidner.aspx|title=How Deep Can You Probe?|last=Zeidner|first=Rita|date=1 October 2007|work=HR Magazine|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a trainee teacher at a high school in Pennsylvania was denied her teaching degree after her supervisor found a picture she posted on MySpace captioned "Drunken pirate" and deemed it "unprofessional". She sued, arguing that by acting on the basis of her legal out-of-hours behavior [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania#Controversies|Millersville University]] had breached her [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, but a federal district court ruled that the photograph was not "protected speech" under the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1|title=The Web Means the End of Forgetting|last=Rosen|first=Jeffrey|date=19 July 2010|work=New York Times|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5068">{{for|the study of soils|Pedology}}
{{expert|date=December 2011}}
'''Pedology''' ('''paidology''', '''paedology''') is the study of children's behavior and development (as distinct from [[pedagogy]], the art or science of teaching, and [[pediatrics]], the field of medicine relating to children). 

The origins of this trend in [[psychology]] and pedagogy go back to the end of the 18th century with the separation of a branch of psychology that would form the basis of pedagogy, a pedagogic psychology or "experimental pedagogic psychology", "experimental pedagogy", "experimental education". 

[[G. Stanley Hall]] (1844-1924) fostered pedology as a separate study, and also became instrumental in the development of modern [[educational psychology]].  An American researcher, [[Oscar Chrisman]], proposed the term "pedology" in 1893. At the end of the 19th century, pedology as a comprehensive study of the child came to prominence in Europe as an attempt to create a study of children in the manner of [[natural sciences]]. In 1909 Professor [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] organized a Pedological Society in [[Lviv]], [[Austro-Hungary]] (now Ukraine). In 1910 a similar society was organized in [[Kraków]]. In 1911 the first World Congress in Pedology took place in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], with attendants from 22 countries.

[[World War I]] (1914-1918) effectively put an end to the development of this study in Western Europe.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

Since pedology as a branch of science never reached its maturity, there is no common established understanding as to the scope or instruments of pedology. 

[[Bowie State University]] in Bowie, Maryland became the first university in the United States to offer a Bachelor's Degree in pedology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bowiestate.edu/academics/departments/behavioral/pedology/ | title=Pedology Major| publisher= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318204420/http://www.bowiestate.edu/academics/departments/behavioral/pedology// | archive-date=18 March 2008 | accessdate=11 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 document from the university refers to "the pedology major (now known as child and adolescent studies)".&lt;ref name="assessment"&gt;{{cite journal|work=Assessment Times|url=https://www.bowiestate.edu/files/resources/newsletter-fall-2014.pdf|publisher=Bowie State University|date=August 2014 | title=Faculty Spotlight: Behavioral, Health and Human Services|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedology in the Soviet Union==
In [[Imperial Russia]] a prominent developer of the field was [[Aleksandr Petrovich Nechayev|Aleksandr Nechayev]] (Александр Петрович Нечаев) in [[St. Petersburg]], who in 1901 created the laboratory of experimental pedagogical psychology. Soviet pedology is traditionally thought to be founded by the efforts of [[Vladimir Bekhterev]]; in particular, in 1918 he founded the Institute of Pedology as part of psychological institutions united into the Institute for Study of Brain and Psychical Activity.

This science was intensively pursued in 1920s-1930s in the [[Soviet Union]]. A journal ''Pedologiya'' ("Педология") was issued.  [[Lev Vygotsky]] was one of its prominent supporters. 

While many works of pedologists were of considerable value, the approach was severely criticized for over-enthusiastic but poorly grounded approach of [[Test (student assessment)|testing]] for predicting a child's mental development, in addition to estimating its status. 

It was officially banned in 1936 after a special decree of [[VKP(b)]] [[Central Committee]] "On Pedological Perversions in the [[Narkompros]] System" on July 4, 1936 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/36976031/Russian_Federation_in_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_the_History_of_Psychology_Pt_1 | title=Russian Federation | archive-date=4 June 2018 | accessdate=4 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Pederasty in ancient Greece''' was a socially acknowledged romantic relationship between an adult male (the ''erastes'') and a younger male (the ''eromenos'') usually in his teens.&lt;ref&gt;C.D.C. Reeve, ''Plato on Love:'' Lysis, Symposium, Phaedrus, Alcibiades ''with Selections from'' Republic'' and'' Laws (Hackett, 2006), p. xxi [https://books.google.com/books?id=E1lQNf2EfEUC&amp;pg=PP25 online]; Martti Nissinen, ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective'', translated by Kirsi Stjerna (Augsburg Fortress, 1998, 2004), p. 57 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&amp;pg=PA57 online]; Nigel Blake ''et al.'', ''Education in an Age of Nihilism'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 183 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lgkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA183 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was characteristic of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical periods]].&lt;ref&gt;Nissinen,  ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World'', p. 57; William Armstrong Percy III, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," in ''Same–Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West'' (Binghamton: Haworth, 2005), p. 17. Sexual variety, not excluding ''paiderastia'', was characteristic of the [[Hellenistic era]]; see [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], "Sex and Classical Literature," in ''Classical Bearings: Interpreting Ancient Culture and History'' (University of California Press, 1989, 1998), p. 146 [https://books.google.com/books?id=zlFXc9N19yUC&amp;pg=PA146 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of pederasty on Greek culture of these periods was so pervasive that it has been called "the principal cultural model for free relationships between citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, ''Cities of the Gods'', p. 193. See also George Boys-Stones, "Eros in Government: Zeno and the Virtuous City," ''Classical Quarterly'' 48 (1998), 168–174: "there is a certain kind of sexual relationship which was considered by many Greeks to be very important for the cohesion of the city: sexual relations between men and youths. Such relationships were taken to play such an important role in fostering cohesion where it mattered — among the male population — that [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]] even gave them official recognition in his constitution for Sparta" (p. 169).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars locate its origin in [[initiation ritual]], particularly rites of passage on [[Crete]], where it was associated with entrance into military life and the religion of [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert B.

Jeanmaire and R.F. Willetts (pp. 104–105); Deborah Kamen, "The Life Cycle in Archaic Greece," in The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 91–92. [[Kenneth Dover]], a pioneer in the study of Greek homosexuality, rejects the initiation theory of origin; see  "Greek Homosexuality and Initiation," in ''Que(e)rying Religion: A Critical Anthology'' (Continuum, 1997), pp. 19–38. For Dover, it seems, the argument that Greek ''paiderastia'' as a social custom was related to rites of passage constitutes a denial of homosexuality as natural or innate; this may be to overstate or misrepresent what the initiatory theorists have said. The initiatory theory claims to account not for the existence of ancient Greek homosexuality in general but rather for that of formal ''paiderastia''.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has no formal existence in the [[Homeric epics]], and seems to have developed in the late 7th century BC as an aspect of Greek [[homosociality|homosocial culture]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hubbard, "Pindar's ''Tenth Olympian'' and Athlete-Trainer Pederasty," in ''Same–Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity'', pp. 143 and 163 (note 37), with cautions about the term "homosocial" from Percy, p. 49, note 5.&lt;/ref&gt; which was characterized also by [[Nudity in sport|athletic]] and [[Depictions of nudity|artistic nudity]], delayed marriage for aristocrats, [[symposium|symposia]], and the social seclusion of women.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," p. 17 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPZu3Ktu5cC&amp;pg=PA17 online] ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Pederasty was both idealized and criticized in [[ancient Greek literature|ancient literature]] and [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]].&lt;!--this is a point too fundamental to cite fully here; it will be discussed at length in a section--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see Kenneth Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 165, note 18, where the eschatological value of ''paiderastia'' for the soul in Plato is noted.  For a more cynical view of the custom, see the comedies of Aristophanes, e.g. ''Wealth'' 149-59. Paul Gilabert Barberà, "John Addington Symonds. ''A Problem in Greek Ethics''.

Why?" in ''The Statesman in Plutarch's Works'' (Brill, 2004), p. 303 [https://books.google.com/books?id=cruTUAFuWWMC&amp;pg=PA303 online]; and the pioneering view of [[Havelock Ellis]], ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'' (Philadelphia: F.A. Davis, 1921, 3rd ed.), vol. 2, p. 12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-tgTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12 online.] For [[Stoicism|Stoic]] "utopian" views of ''paiderastia'', see Doyne Dawson, ''Cities of the Gods: Communist Utopias in Greek Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 192 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HwsWp43OWjsC&amp;pg=PA192 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument has recently been made that idealization was universal in the Archaic period; criticism began in Athens as part of the general Classical Athenian reassessment of Archaic culture.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Andrew Lear]], 'Was pederasty problematized?  ''A diachronic view' in Sex in Antiquity:  exploring gender and sexuality in the ancient world'', eds. Mark Masterson, Nancy Rabinowitz, and James Robson (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have debated the role or extent of pederasty, which is likely to have varied according to local custom and individual inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lambert, "Athens," in ''Gay Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word "[[pederasty]]" in present-day usage might imply the [[Laws regarding child sexual abuse|abuse]] of [[minor (law)|minors]] in certain jurisdictions, but [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] law, for instance, recognized [[Consent (criminal law)|consent]] but not [[Age of consent|age]] as a factor in regulating sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne following. Gloria Ferrari, however, notes that there were conventions of age pertaining to sexual activity, and if a man violated these by seducing a boy who was too young to consent to becoming an ''eromenos'', the [[sexual predator|predator]] might be subject to prosecution under the law of ''[[hubris]]''; ''Figures of Speech: Men and Maidens in Ancient Greece'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Kouros anavissos.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Kouros]]'' representing an idealized youth, c.&amp;nbsp;530 BC]]The Greek word ''paiderastia'' ({{lang|grc|παιδεραστία}}) is an [[abstract noun]]. It is formed from ''paiderastês'', which in turn is a compound of ''pais'' ("child", plural ''paides'') and ''erastês'' (see below).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pederasty Etymologies] in ''American Heritage Dictionary'', ''Random House Dictionary'', and ''Online Etymology Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the word ''pais'' can refer to a child of either sex, ''paiderastia'' is defined by [[Henry Liddell|Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott]]'s [[A Greek-English Lexicon|''Greek-English Lexicon'']] as "the love of boys", and the verb ''paiderasteuein'' as "to be a lover of boys".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940 9th ed., with 1968 supplement in 1985 reprinting), p. 1286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of [[Kenneth Dover]]'s work ''[[Greek Homosexuality (book)|Greek Homosexuality]]'', the terms ''erastês'' and ''erômenos'' have been standard for the two pederastic roles.&lt;ref&gt;The pair of terms are used both within and outside the field of classical studies. For surveys and reference works within the study of ancient culture and history, see for instance ''The World of Athens: An Introduction to Classical Athenian Culture'', a publication of the Joint Association of Classical Teachers (Cambridge University Press, 1984, 2003), pp. 149–150 [https://books.google.com/books?id=VgDKeqi4or8C&amp;pg=PA149 online]; John Grimes Younger, ''Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z'' pp. 91–92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IEqPs2Toy7YC&amp;pg=PA92 online.] Outside classical studies, see for instance Michael Burger, ''The Shaping of Western Civilization: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), pp. 50–51 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MQUs2QnC2F4C&amp;pg=PA50 online]; Richard C. Friedman and Jennifer I. Downey, ''Sexual Orientation and Psychoanalysis: Sexual Science and Clinical Practice'' (Columbia University Press, 2002), pp. 168–169 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwtokhymV_4C&amp;pg=PA168 online]; Michael R. Kauth, ''True Nature: A Theory of Sexual Attraction'' (Springer, 2000), p. 87 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PzDKr-qCdTAC&amp;pg=PA87 online]; Roberto Haran, ''Lacan's Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (2004), p. 165ff. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOl1hki9tSMC&amp;pg=PA165 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Both words derive from the Greek verb ''erô'', ''erân'', "to love"; see also [[eros]]. In Dover's strict dichotomy, the ''erastês'' ({{lang|grc|ἐραστής}}, plural ''erastai'') is the older lover, seen as the active or dominant partner,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[suffix]] ''-tês'' (-{{lang|grc|τής}}) denoting [[Agent (grammar)|agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Weir Smyth, "Formation of Substantives," sections 838–839, ''Greek Grammar'' (Harvard University Press, 1920, 1984), pp. 229–230. The insertion of the [[sigma]] between verb stem and suffix is [[Phonaesthetics|euphonic]] (§836).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Erastês'' should be distinguished from Greek ''paiderastês'', which meant "lover of boys" usually with a negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, ''Greek-English Lexicon'', p. 1286.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''erastês'' himself might only be in his early twenties,&lt;ref&gt;William Armstrong Percy III, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'' (University of Illinois Press, 1996), p. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TCvoj1efp8UC&amp;pg=PA1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the age difference between the two lovers might be negligible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum]], "Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies," ''Sex and Social Justice'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 309: "because the popular thought of our day tends to focus on the scare image of a 'dirty old man' hanging around outside the school waiting to molest young boys, it is important to mention, as well, that the ''erastês'' might not be very far in age from the ''erômenos''."&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''erômenos'', or "beloved"  (ἐρώμενος, plural ''eromenoi''), is the [[grammatical gender|masculine]] form of the [[Ancient Greek grammar#Participle|present passive participle]] from ''erô'', viewed by Dover as the passive or subordinate partner. An ''erômenos'' can also be called ''pais'', "child".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pais'' was regarded as a future citizen, not an "inferior object of sexual gratification", and was portrayed with respect in art.&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Johnson and Terry Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature: A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2005), p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HhjWNd2R1F8C&amp;pg=PA4 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The word can be understood as an endearment such as a parent might use, found also in the poetry of [[Sappho]]&lt;ref&gt;It is uncertain whether the ''pais'' Kleis is Sappho's actual daughter, or whether the word is affectionate. Anne L. Klinck, "'Sleeping in the Bosom of a Tender Companion': Homoerotic Attachments in Sappho," in ''Same-sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 202 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPZu3Ktu5cC&amp;pg=PA202 online]; Jane McIntosh Snyder, ''The Woman and the Lyre'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), p. 3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=X4CLx2PMk4wC&amp;pg=PA3 online.] The word ''pais'' can also be used of a bride; see Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society'', p. 80, note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and a designation of only relative age. Both art and other literary references show that the ''erômenos'' was at least a teen, with modern age estimates ranging from 13 to 20, or in some cases up to 30. Most evidence indicates that to be an eligible ''erômenos'', a youth would be of an age when an aristocrat began his formal military training,&lt;ref&gt;"We can conclude that the ''erômenos'' is generally old enough for mature military and political action": Nussbaum, "Platonic Love and Colorado Law," p. 309 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7zoaKIolT9oC&amp;pg=PA309 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, from fifteen to seventeen.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Mark Golden, endnote to "Slavery and Homosexuality at Athens: Age Differences between ''erastai'' and ''eromenoi''," in ''Homosexuality in the Ancient World'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992) pp. 175–176 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JrpU6O3VnawC&amp;pg=PA175 online]; also Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Culture'', p. 3; Barry S. Strauss, ''Fathers and Sons in Athens: Ideology and Society in the Era of the Peloponnesian War'' (Routledge, 1993), p. 30 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 online]; Martha Nussbaum, "Eros and the Wise: The Stoic Response to a Cultural Dilemma," ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' 13 (1995, 2001), p. 230 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OHcl0NCon7EC&amp;pg=PA260 online.] Nuances of age also discussed by Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', pp. 131–132 [https://books.google.com/books?id=adP_n7PziZIC&amp;pg=PA131 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; As an indication of physical maturity, the ''erômenos'' was sometimes as tall as or taller than the older ''erastês'', and may have his first facial hair.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', pp. 16 and 85; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Another word used by the Greeks for the younger partner was ''paidika'', a [[grammatical gender|neuter]] plural [[adjective]] ("things having to do with children") treated [[syntax|syntactically]] as masculine singular.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In poetry and philosophical literature, the ''erômenos'' is often an embodiment of idealized youth; a related ideal depiction of youth in Archaic culture was the ''[[kouros]]'', the long-haired male statuary [[art nude|nude]].&lt;ref&gt;Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 61, considers the ''kouroi'' to be examples of pederastic art. "The particular attributes that ''kouroi'' display match those of such 'beloveds' in the visual and literary sources from the late archaic to the classical age": Deborah Tam Steiner, ''Images in Mind: Statues in Archaic and Classical Greek Literature and Thought'' (Princeton University Press, 2001), p. 215 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zah23ru6oCMC&amp;pg=PA218 online.] The presence of facial and pubic hair on some ''kouroi'' disassociates them with the ''erômenos'' if the latter is taken only as a boy who has not entered adolescence; thus Jeffrey M. Hurwit, "The Human Figure in Early Greek Sculpture and Vase-Painting," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 275 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6LUcuGdJF30C&amp;pg=PA275 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Fragility of Goodness'', [[Martha Nussbaum]], following Dover, defines the ideal ''erômenos'' as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a beautiful creature without pressing needs of his own. He is aware of his attractiveness, but self-absorbed in his relationship with those who desire him. He will smile sweetly at the admiring lover; he will show appreciation for the other's friendship, advice, and assistance. He will allow the lover to greet him by touching, affectionately, his genitals and his face, while he looks, himself, demurely at the ground. … The inner experience of an ''erômenos'' would be characterized, we may imagine, by a feeling of proud self-sufficiency. Though the object of importunate solicitation, he is himself not in need of anything beyond himself. He is unwilling to let himself be explored by the other's needy curiosity, and he has, himself, little curiosity about the other. He is something like a god, or the statue of a god.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum]], ''The Fragility of Goodness: (Cambridge University Press, 1986, 2001), p. 188 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GCKqZkyzFO0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA188 online.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dover insisted that the active role of the ''erastês'' and the passivity of the ''erômenos'' is a distinction "of the highest importance",&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; but subsequent scholars have tried to present a more varied picture of the behaviors and values associated with ''paiderastia''. Although ancient Greek writers use ''erastês'' and ''erômenos'' in a pederastic context, the words are not technical terms for social roles, and can refer to the "lover" and "beloved" in other hetero- and homosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, "Greek Homosexuality and Initiation," pp. 19–20, notes the usage of "the same words for homosexual as for heterosexual emotion … and the same for its physical consummation" from the archaic period on.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{See also|Cretan pederasty}}
The Greek practice of pederasty came suddenly into prominence at the end of the Archaic period of Greek history; there is a brass plaque from Crete, about 650-625 BC, which is the oldest surviving representation of pederastic custom. Such representations appear from all over Greece in the next century; literary sources show it as being established custom in many cities by the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, pp. 205-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Cretan pederasty as a social institution seems to have been grounded in an initiation which involved [[Bride kidnapping|abduction]]. A man ({{lang-grc|φιλήτωρ}} – ''philetor'', "lover") selected a youth, enlisted the chosen one's friends to help him, and carried off the object of his affections to his ''andreion'', a sort of men's club or meeting hall. The youth received gifts, and the ''philetor'' along with the friends went away with him for two months into the countryside, where they hunted and feasted. At the end of this time, the ''philetor'' presented the youth with three contractually required gifts: military attire, an ox, and a drinking cup. Other costly gifts followed. Upon their return to the city, the youth sacrificed the ox to Zeus, and his friends joined him at the feast. He received special clothing that in adult life marked him as ''kleinos'', "famous, renowned". The initiate was called a ''parastatheis'', "he who stands beside", perhaps because, like [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] the cup-bearer of Zeus, he stood at the side of the ''philetor'' during meals in the ''andreion'' and served him from the cup that had been ceremonially presented. In this interpretation, the formal custom reflects [[myth and ritual]].&lt;ref&gt;The main source for this rite of initiation is [[Strabo]] 10.483–484, quoting [[Ephoros]]; the summary given here is the construction of Robert B. Koehl, "The Chieftain Cup and a Minoan Rite of Passage," ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 106 (1986), pp. 105–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspects==

The erastes-eromenos relationship played a role in the Classical Greek social and educational system, had its own complex social-sexual etiquette and was an important social institution among the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;John Pollini, "The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver," ''Art Bulletin'' 81.1 (1999) 21–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Pederasty has been understood as educative,&lt;ref&gt;Blake ''et al.'', ''Education in an Age of Nihilism'', p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; and Greek authors from [[Aristophanes]] to [[Pindar]] felt it naturally present in the context of aristocratic education (''[[paideia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Nagy]], "Early Greek Views of Poets and Poetry," in ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticis: Classical Criticism'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 1997), p. 40 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qNCDdy6fD18C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=paiderastia&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=40#v=onepage&amp;q=paiderastia&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, pederasty as described in the Greek literary sources is an institution reserved for free citizens, perhaps to be regarded as a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] mentorship: "pederasty was widely accepted in Greece as part of a male's coming-of-age, even if its function is still widely debated."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Sarah Iles. ''Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2004. pg. 446; see also Cocca, Carolyn. ''Adolescent Sexuality: A Historical Handbook and Guide''. Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 2006. pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In Crete, in order for the suitor to carry out the ritual abduction, the father had to approve him as worthy of the honor. Among the Athenians, as [[Socrates]] claims in [[Xenophon]]'s ''Symposium,'' "Nothing [of what concerns the boy] is kept hidden from the father, by an ideal&lt;ref&gt;The term here rendered as "ideal" is καλοκἀγαθίᾳ, translated as "a perfect man, a man as he should be" in Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford, 1968; p.397)&lt;/ref&gt; lover."&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Symposium;'' VIII.11&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect their sons from inappropriate attempts at seduction, fathers appointed slaves called ''[[pedagogue]]s'' to watch over their sons. However, according to Aeschines, Athenian fathers would pray that their sons would be handsome and attractive, with the full knowledge that they would then attract the attention of men and "be the objects of fights because of erotic passions".&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Wohl, ''Love among the Ruins: The Erotics of Democracy in Classical Athens'' p.5 referring to Aeschines, (Tim.134)&lt;/ref&gt;

The age-range when boys entered into such relationships was consonant with that of Greek girls given in marriage, often to adult husbands many years their senior. Boys, however, usually had to be courted and were free to choose their mate, while marriages for girls were arranged for economic and political advantage at the discretion of father and suitor.&lt;ref&gt;A Henri Irénée Marrou, George Lamb, ''History of Education in Antiquity'' p.27&lt;/ref&gt; These connections were also an advantage for a youth and his family, as the relationship with an influential older man resulted in an expanded social network.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Thus, some considered it desirable to have had many admirers or mentors, if not necessarily lovers per se, in one’s younger years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Typically, after their sexual relationship had ended and the young man had married, the older man and his protégé would remain on close terms throughout their life. For those lovers who continued their lovemaking after their beloveds had matured, the Greeks made allowances, saying, "You can lift up a bull, if you carried the calf."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Calimach]], ''Lovers' Legends: The Gay Greek Myths''&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Greece, pederasty was an acceptable form of homoeroticism that had other, less socially accepted manifestations, such as the sexual use of slaves or being a ''pornos'' ([[prostitution|prostitute]]) or ''hetairos'' (the male equivalent of a [[hetaira]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male prostitution was treated as a perfectly routine matter and visiting prostitutes of either sex was considered completely acceptable for a male citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martha C.

===Political expression===
Transgressions of the customs pertaining to the proper expression of homosexuality within the bounds of ''pederaistia'' could be used to damage the reputation of a public figure.  In his speech ''Against Timarchus'' in 346 BC, the Athenian politician [[Aeschines]] argues against further allowing Timarchus, an experienced middle-aged politician, certain political rights as Attic law prohibited anyone who had prostituted himself from exercising those rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth J. Dover|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Timarchus was known to have spent his adolescence as the sexual partner of a series of wealthy men in order to obtain money.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines, Against Timarchus 1.51-52&lt;/ref&gt; Such a law existed because it was believed that anyone who had sold their own body would not hesitate to sell the interests of the city-state.&lt;ref name="Greek Homosexuality" /&gt; Aeschines won his case, and Timarchus was sentenced to ''[[atimia]]'' (disenfranchisement and civic disempowerment). Aeschines acknowledges his own dalliances with beautiful boys, the erotic poems he dedicated to these youths, and the scrapes he has gotten into as a result of his affairs, but emphasizes that none of these were mediated by money. A financial motive thus was viewed as threatening a man's status as free.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

By contrast, as expressed in [[Pausanias of Athens|Pausanias']] speech in Plato's ''Symposium,'' pederastic love was said to be favorable to [[democracy]] and feared by tyrants, because the bond between the ''erastes'' and ''eromenos'' was stronger than that of obedience to a despotic ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Hindley, "Debate: Law, Society and Homosexuality in Classical Athens" in ''Past and Present,'' 133 (1991), p. 167n4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Symposium'' 182c.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athenaeus]] states that "Hieronymus the Aristotelian says that love with boys was fashionable because several tyrannies had been overturned by young men in their prime, joined together as comrades in mutual sympathy." He gives as examples of such pederastic couples the Athenians [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], who were credited (perhaps symbolically) with the overthrow of the tyrant [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] and the establishment of the democracy, and also Chariton and Melanippus.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists,'' 602&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Aristotle, claimed that the Cretan lawgivers encouraged pederasty as a means of [[population control]], by directing love and sexual desire into non-procreative channels:

&lt;blockquote&gt;and the lawgiver has devised many wise measures to secure the benefit of moderation at table, and the segregation of the women in order that they may not bear many children, for which purpose he instituted association with the male sex.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'' 2.1272a 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Philosophical expression===
&lt;!--clearer outline of different philosophical positions needed; where are the Stoics, for instance?--&gt;
Socrates' love of [[Alcibiades]], which was more than reciprocated, is held as an example of chaste pederasty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Socrates remarks in the dialogue Phaedrus that sexual pederasty is driven by the appetital part of the soul, but can be balanced by self-control and reason. He likens wanton lust for a boy to allowing a disobedient horse to control a chariot, but remarks that sexual desire for a boy if combined with a love for their other qualities is acceptable.

[[Phaedrus (Athenian)|Phaedrus]] in Plato's Symposium remarks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For I know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning in life than a virtuous lover, or to a lover than a beloved youth. For the principle, I say, neither kindred, nor honor, nor wealth, nor any motive is able to implant so well as love. Of what am I speaking? Of the sense of honor and dishonor, without which neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work… And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonor and emulating one another in honor; and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that when fighting at each other’s side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Phaedrus in the ''Symposium''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Laws, Plato takes a much more austere stance to homosexuality than in previous works, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... one certainly should not fail to observe that when male unites with female for procreation the pleasure experienced is held to be due to nature, but contrary to nature when male mates with male or female with female, and that those first guilty of such enormities [the Cretans] were impelled by their slavery to pleasure. And we all accuse the Cretans of concocting the story about Ganymede. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato states here that "we all", possibly referring to society as a whole or simply his social group, believe the story of Ganymede's homosexuality to have been fabricated by the Cretans to justify immoral behaviours. 

The Athenian stranger in Plato's ''Laws'' blames pederasty for promoting civil strife and driving many to their wits' end, and recommends the prohibition of [[sexual intercourse]] with youths, laying out a path whereby this may be accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'', 636d and 835e&lt;/ref&gt;

===In myth and religion===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Religion and sexuality]]--&gt;&lt;!--For instance, if there's any basis to treating Narcissus as a pederastic myth, that should be moved here--&gt;

The [[Greek mythology|myth]] of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]'s abduction by [[Zeus]] was invoked as a precedent for the pederastic relationship, as Theognis asserts to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is some pleasure in loving a boy ''(paidophilein)'', since once in fact even the son of [[Cronus]] ''(that is, Zeus)'', king of immortals, fell in love with Ganymede, seized him, carried him off to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], and made him divine, keeping the lovely bloom of boyhood ''(paideia)''. So, don't be astonished, Simonides, that I too have been revealed as captivated by love for a handsome boy.&lt;ref&gt;Theognidean corpus 1345–50, as cited by Kamen, "The Life Cycle in Archaic Greece," p. 91. Although the speaker is identified here conventionally as Theognis, certain portions of the work attributed to him may not be by the Megaran poet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The myth of Ganymede's abduction, however, was not taken seriously by some in Athenian society, and deemed to be a Cretan fabrication designed to justify their homoeroticism.&lt;ref&gt; Plato's Laws, 636c &lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar Joseph Pequigney states:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Neither Homer nor Hesiod ever explicitly ascribes homosexual experiences to the gods or to heroes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 5th century BC poet [[Pindar]] constructed the story of a sexual pederastic relationship between [[Poseidon]] and [[Pelops]], this was intended to replace an earlier story of cannibalism that Pindar deemed an unsavoury representation of the Gods.&lt;ref&gt; Joseph Pequigney, Homosexuality in ancient Greek myth &lt;/ref&gt; The story tells of Poseidon's love for a mortal boy, Pelops, who wins a chariot race with help from his admirer Poseidon. 

Though examples of such a custom exist in earlier Greek works, myths providing examples of young men who were the lovers of gods began to emerge in classical literature, around the 6th century BC. In these later tales, pederastic love is ascribed to [[Zeus]] (with [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]), [[Poseidon]] (with [[Pelops]]), [[Apollo]] (with Cyparissus, Hyacinthus and Adnetus), [[Orpheus]], [[Heracles]], [[Dionysus]], [[Hermes]], and [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].  All the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] except [[Ares]] are purported to have had these relationships, which some scholars argue demonstrates that the specific customs of ''paiderastia'' originated in initiatory rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Sergent, ''Homosexuality and Greek Myth,'' ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Mythology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html |title=Classical Mythology |publisher=[[glbtq.com]] |accessdate=February 5, 2015 |last=Pequigney |first=Joseph |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129042407/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myths attributed to the homosexuality of [[Dionysus]] are very late and often post-pagan additions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ampelos]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}} The tale of Dionyssus and [[Ampelos]] was written by the Egyptian poet [[Nonnus]] some time between the 4th and 5th centuries AD, making it unreliable. Likewise, the tale of Dionysus and [[Polymnus]], which tells that the former anally masturbated with a fig branch over the latter's grave, was written by Christians, whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Hyginus, Astronomy 2.5; Clement of Alexandria, Protreptikos 2.34.2-5; Arnobius, Against the Gentiles 5.28 (Dalby 2005, pp. 108–117) &lt;/ref&gt;

Dover, however, believed that these myths are only literary versions expressing or explaining the "overt" homosexuality of Greek archaic culture, the distinctiveness of which he contrasted to attitudes in other ancient societies such as Egypt and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, "Greek Homosexuality and Initiation,"''passim'', especially pp. 19–20, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greek pottery|Greek vase painting]] is a major source for scholars seeking to understand attitudes and practices associated with ''paiderastia''.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent collation of evidence from vase-painting and an introduction to its interpretation, see [[Andrew Lear]], and [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Images of Ancient Greek Pederasty: Boys Were Their Gods'' (Routledge, 2008). {{ISBN|978-0-415-22367-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of pederastic scenes are depicted on [[Black-figure pottery#Attica|Attic black-figure vases]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Kamen, "The Life Cycle in Archaic Greece," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 91 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6LUcuGdJF30C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%22hundreds+of+representations+of+pederastic+relationships%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hundreds%20of%20representations%20of%20pederastic%20relationships%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, [[John Beazley]] classified pederastic vases into three types:
* The ''erastês'' and ''erômenos'' stand facing each other; the ''erastês'', knees bent, reaches with one hand for the beloved's chin and with the other for his genitals.
* The ''erastês'' presents the ''erômenos'' with a small gift, sometimes an animal.
* The standing lovers engage in [[intercrural sex]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley as summarized by Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain gifts traditionally given by the ''eromenos'' become symbols that contribute to interpreting a given scene as pederastic. Animal gifts—most commonly hares and roosters, but also deer and felines—point toward hunting as an aristocratic pastime and as a metaphor for sexual pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Judith M. Barringer, ''The Hunt in Ancient Greece'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), pp. 70–72 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMqCYtXqub4C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22Attic+vase+painting+scenes+of+pederastic+courtship%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Attic%20vase%20painting%20scenes%20of%20pederastic%20courtship%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit nature of some images has led in particular to discussions of whether the ''eromenos'' took active pleasure in the sex act. The youthful beloved is never pictured with an erection; his penis "remains flaccid even in circumstances to which one would expect the penis of any healthy adolescent to respond willy-nilly".&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, ''The Fragility of Goodness'', p. 188; see also Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', p. 96; Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Fondling the youth's genitals was one of the most common images of pederastic courtship on vases, a gesture indicated also in Aristophanes' comedy ''[[The Birds (play)|Birds]]'' (line 142). Some vases do show the younger partner as sexually responsive, prompting one scholar to wonder, "What can the point of this act have been unless lovers in fact derived some pleasure from feeling and watching the boy's developing organ wake up and respond to their manual stimulation?"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hubbard, review of David Halperin's ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality'' (2002), ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 22 September 2003 [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-09-22.html online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronological study of the vase paintings also reveals a changing aesthetic in the depiction of the ''erômenos''. In the 6th century BC, he is a young beardless man with long hair, of adult height and physique, usually nude. As the 5th century begins, he has become smaller and slighter, "barely pubescent", and often draped as a girl would be. No inferences about social customs should be based on this element of the courtship scene alone.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 140; Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poetry====
There are many pederastic references among the works of the [[Megara]]n poet [[Theognis]] addressed to Cyrnus (Greek ''Kyrnos'').  Some portions of the Theognidean corpus are probably not by the individual from Megara, but rather represent "several generations of [[wisdom poetry]]".  The poems are "social, political, or ethical precepts transmitted to Cyrnus as part of his formation into an adult Megarian aristocrat in Theognis' own image".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, ''Homosexuality in Greece and Rome:''
a sourcebook of basic documents in translation,'' University of California, 2003; p.23''&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Theognis and Kyrnos eludes categorization. Although it was assumed in antiquity that Kyrnos was the poet's ''eromenos'', the poems that are most explicitly erotic are not addressed to him; the poetry&lt;ref&gt;Theognis, 2.1353–56.&lt;/ref&gt; on "the joys and sorrows" of pederasty seem more apt for sharing with a fellow ''erastes'', perhaps in the setting of the symposium: "the relationship, in any case, is left vague."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lamberton, ''Hesiod'' (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 26 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BL2AZpopNu8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA26&amp;dq=Theognis+Kyrnos&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=Theognis%20Kyrnos&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, Theognis (and the tradition that appears under his name) treats the pederastic relationship as heavily pedagogical.&lt;ref&gt;On the contrast between the Theognidean and Anacreontic visions of pederasty, see [[Andrew Lear]] 'Ancient Pederasty:  an introduction' in ''A Companion to Greek and Roman Sexualities'', ed. Thomas K. Hubbard (Wiley Blackwell, 2014), pp. 104-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The poetic traditions of Ionia and Aeolia featured poets such as [[Anacreon]], [[Mimnermus]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], who composed many of the sympotic [[skolia]] that were to become later part of the mainland tradition. [[Ibycus]] came from [[Rhegium]] in the Greek west and entertained the court of [[Polycrates]] in Samos with pederastic verses.  By contrast with Theognis, these poets portray a version of pederasty that is non-pedagogical, focused exclusively on love and seduction. [[Theocritus]], a Hellenistic poet, describes a kissing contest for youths that took place at the tomb of a certain Diocles, renowned for friendship; he notes that invoking [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] was proper to the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Theocritus, Idyll XII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beazley, "Some Attic Vases in the Cyprus Museum", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 33 (1947); p.199; Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', pp. 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt; (Athenian amphora, 5th century BCE)]]

==Sexual practices==
Vase paintings and references to the eromenos's thighs in poetry&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society'', p. 116, note 4, quoting a fragment from [[Solon]]: "a man falls in love with a youth in the full-flower of boy-love / possessed of desire-enhancing thighs and a honey-sweet mouth"; Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', p. 450, note 48, quoting a fragment of the lost ''Myrmidons'' of [[Aeschylus]] in which [[Achilles]] mourns the dead [[Patroclus]], their "many kisses", and the "god-fearing converse with your thighs".&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that when the pederastic couple engaged in sex acts, the preferred form was [[intercrural sex|intercrural]].&lt;ref&gt;Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 119; Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', pp. 268, 307, 335; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve his dignity and honor, the ''erômenos'' limits the man who desires him to penetration between closed thighs.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no known visual depictions of [[Anal sex]] between pederastic couples, though this does not prove the behavior did not occur. Some vase paintings, which Percy considers a fourth type of pederastic scene in addition to Beazley's three, show the ''erastês'' seated with an erection and the ''erômenos'' either approaching or climbing into his lap. The composition of these scenes is the same as that for depictions of women mounting men who are seated and aroused for intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Ancient Greece,'' p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; As a cultural norm considered apart from personal preference, anal penetration was most often seen as dishonorable to the one penetrated, or shameful,&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', pp. 268, 335; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; because of "its potential appearance of being turned into a woman" and because it was feared that it may distract the ''erômenos'' from playing the active, penetrative role later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1547, 1550|jstor=1073514|quote=* Where relations between two male citizens are concerned, we again find no general condemnation, but instead a complex system of caveats or reservations. We must begin by noting that these relations, even when they involve people close to one another in age, always involve an asymmetry of roles: the erastes or "lover" is the older partner, who actively pursues and courts the younger, drawn by the sight of youthful male beauty. The eraste's is expected to be keenly interested in sexual contact; this interest, and the active, penetrative conduct that follows from it, is taken to be perfectly normal and natural. The younger partner, the eromenos or "beloved", is likely to be pleased at being the object of admiration and interested in benefits such as friendship, education, and political advancement that a relationship with an erastes may bestow. The relationship may in this sense involve a real reciprocity of benefits and mutual affection based on it. But the cultural norm dictates that the eromenos is not to have a keen sexual interest in being penetrated, nor to develop habits of enjoying that sort of penetration; for that would be, in effect, to be turned into a woman, and one could expect that this would make him unfit to play, later in life, an active manly role. * The important point to stress, in any case, is that the shame potentially at issue was not about the fact of same-sex copulation, but about the "womanish" position of passivity and its potential appearance of being turned into a woman. No such shame, it would seem, attached even potentially to conduct that did not involve anal penetration, thus not to conduct involving intercrural intercourse, apparently the most common mode of male-male copulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fable attributed to [[Aesop]] tells how [[Aeschyne]] (Shame) consented to enter the human body from behind only as long as Eros did not follow the same path, and would fly away at once if he did. A man who acted as the receiver during anal intercourse may have been the recipient of the insult "kinaidos", meaning effeminate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aesop]], "Zeus and Shame" (Perry 109, Chambry 118, Gibbs 528), in ''Fables''.&lt;/ref&gt; No shame was associated with intercrural penetration or any other act that did not involve anal penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1550|jstor=1073514|quote=No such shame, it would seem, attached even potentially to conduct that did not involve anal penetration, thus not to conduct involving intercrural intercourse, apparently the most common mode of male-male copulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral sex is likewise not depicted,{{Request quotation|date=September 2015}} or directly suggested, anal or oral penetration seems to have been reserved for prostitutes or slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature'', p. 3, based on Attic red-figure pottery; Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Ancient Greece,'' p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dover maintained that the erômenos was ideally not supposed to feel "unmanly" desire for the erastês.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum]] argues that the depiction of the erômenos as deriving no sexual pleasure from sex with the erastês "may well be a cultural norm that conceals a more complicated reality", as the erômenos is known to have frequently felt intense affection for his erastês and there is evidence that he experienced sexual arousal with him as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martha C. Nussbaum|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1554–1555|jstor=1073514|publisher=Virginia Law Review|quote=We must now also address the issue of mutuality, which Finnis misuses to make the erastes-eromenos relationship look inherently exploitative. It is true that the eromenos is depicted typically as deriving no sexual pleasure from the conduct, although this may well be a cultural norm that conceals a more complicated reality. Dover aptly compares the situation of the eromenos to that of a young woman in Britain in the 1930s (Dover, Greek Homosexuality, supra note 48, at 88). He might have extended the comparison to take in this point: just as a proper Victorian woman was publicly expected not to enjoy sex, but frequently did in private, so too it is possible that the eromenos derived more pleasure than is publicly depicted. In his postscript to the second edition, Dover grants that there is some literary evidence that the erastes stimulated the penis of the eromenos, and that one vase shows an eromenos with an erection. What is more important is that it is perfectly clear that a successful relationship of this sort produced many advantages for the younger man- education, political advancement, friendship and that he frequently felt intense affection for the erastes as a result.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'',  it is related that, with time, the erômenos develops a "passionate longing" for his erastês and a "reciprocal love" (''anteros'') for him that is a replica of the erastês' love. The eromenos is also said to have a desire "similar to the erastes', albeit weaker, to see, to touch, to kiss and to lie with him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martha C. Nussbaum|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1572–1573|jstor=1073514|publisher=Virginia Law Review|quote=Nor is passionate arousal a mere stage in the soul's progress: it gives rise to an enduring relationship in which physical infatuation is deepened by conversation and the pursuit of shared spiritual goals and in which the "mad" lover's state gives rise to generous and stable friendship, rather than to the dangers of which "Lysias" warns. Most remarkable of all, it also gives rise to a reciprocation of sexual desire on the part of the younger man who, taking note of the unparalleled generosity of his lover, finds himself suffused with a stream of desire from "the source of that stream that Zeus, in love with Ganymede, called 'passionate longing.'" The younger man conceives a longing and desire for his erastes, "having a 'reciprocal-love' [anteros] that is a replica of the other's love." But he calls it, and thinks that it is, philia rather than eros. He has desire similar to the other's, albeit weaker, to see, to touch, to kiss, to lie with him. Recall that Greek homosexuality involves reciprocity conventionally of a sort, for the eromenos receives kindliness and education in return for his beauty. Here the language indicates the culturally unusual nature of the proposal, for the young man lacks a word for his own desire. Plato, thus, constructs a more thoroughgoing understanding of reciprocity, extending to the body's longing for beauty. The relationship is envisaged as a long-lasting one, in which the erastes and eromenos "associate with touching in the gymnasia and in other places of association". What is at issue is a complicated etymological play on the word himeros, or "passionate longing". Himeros has been etymologized as deriving from "particles" (mere') that "flow" (rhein) from the beloved to the lover. The dialogue is suffused with this sort of word play, much of it erotic. See id.; cf. Plato, Cratylus 419e (using similarly expressive and erotic language).  Such reciprocity was not unknown before this-Socrates describes the experience as one that is likely to follow upon the young man's perception of his lover's generosity-but what is clear is that the cultural vocabulary lacks a description for it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional characteristics==
===The Greek East===
Unlike the Dorians, where a lover would usually have only one eromenos, in the east a man might have several eromenoi over the course of his life. From the poems of Alcaeus we learn that the lover would customarily invite his eromenos to dine with him.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, William A. ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece,'' pp146-150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sparta===
[[File:Hyakinthos.jpg|thumb|[[Zephyrus]] and [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]], the latter was a patron hero of pederasty in Greece. Attic red-figure cup from Tarquinia, c.&amp;nbsp;490&amp;nbsp;BC]]
The nature of this relationship is in dispute among ancient sources, and modern historians. 

Spartan views on pederasty and homoeroticism were much more austere than those of other parts of Greece.

[[Xenophon]] says in Constitution of the Lacaedemonians that Spartan customs were unsuited to pederasty: a man might aim for idealized friendship with a boy but a sexual relationship was considered "an abomination" tantamount to incest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Constitution of the Lacedaemonians'', 2.13: "The customs instituted by Lycurgus were opposed to all of these. If someone, being himself an honest man, admired a boy's soul and tried to make of him an ideal friend without reproach and to associate with him, he approved, and believed in the excellence of this kind of training. But if it was clear that the attraction lay in the boy's outward beauty, he banned the connexion as an abomination; and thus he caused lovers to abstain from boys no less than parents abstain from sexual intercourse with their children and brothers and sisters with each other." [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0210%3Atext%3DConst.+Lac.%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D13 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]'s Historical Miscellany talks about the responsibilities of an older Spartan citizen to younger inexperienced male lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus]] ''Various History'', 3.10: "I could cite many fine features on the [[ephor]]s of Sparta: I chose a few, I'll report. If a young Spartan, beautiful and well made, preferred a rich friend to a poor righteous man, the [[ephor]]s condemned him to a fine; no doubt, that he might be punished by his love for wealth by the loss of part of his. They punished the same every citizen honest man, who was attached by friendship to none of the young people that we knew to be well born: they thought that an honest man would have made his friend, and perhaps some others, in people like him. Indeed, the kindness of those who love, if indeed deserves to be respected, is a powerful stimulus to excite the beloved's virtue. A Spartan law even ordered to pardon a young man, for his youth and inexperience, the mistakes he committed, and to punish in its place the citizen who loved him, to teach him to be the supervisor and judge of the actions of his friend."&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas F. Scanlon believes [[Sparta]], during its [[Dorians|Dorian]] polis time, is thought to be the first city to practice athletic nudity, and one of the first to formalize pederasty.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Scanlon, "The Dispersion of Pederasty and the Athletic Revolution in Sixth-Century BC Greece," in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West,'' pp. 64-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Megara===
[[Megara]] cultivated good relations with Sparta, and may have been culturally attracted to emulate Spartan practices in the 7th century, when pederasty is postulated to have first been formalized in Dorian cities.&lt;ref&gt;N.G.L. Hammond, ''A history of Greece to 322 BC,'' 1989; p.150&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first cities after Sparta to be associated with the custom of [[athletic nudity]], [[Megara]] was home to the runner [[Orsippus]] who was famed as the first to run the footrace naked at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] and "first of all Greeks to be crowned victor naked".&lt;ref&gt;W. Sweet, ''Sport and Recreation in Ancient Greece,'' 1987; p.125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 1.44.1&lt;/ref&gt; In one poem, the Megaran poet Theognis saw athletic nudity as a prelude to pederasty: "Happy is the lover who works out naked / And then goes home to sleep all day with a beautiful boy."&lt;ref&gt;Theognis, 2.1335–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athens===
{{main article|Athenian pederasty}}
In Athens, as elsewhere, ''pederastia'' appears to have been a characteristic of the aristocracy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Greek pottery|Attic pottery]] is a major source for modern scholars attempting to understand the institution of pederasty.&lt;ref&gt;Rommel Mendès-Leite et al. ''Gay Studies from the French Cultures'' p.157; Percy, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The age of youth depicted has been estimated variously from 12 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Athenian laws addressed the pederastic relationship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Boeotia===
In [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], the main polis in [[Boeotia]], renowned for its practice of pederasty, the tradition was enshrined in the [[founding myth]] of the city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In this instance the story was meant to teach by counterexample: it depicts [[Laius]], one of the mythical ancestors of the Thebans, in the role of a lover who betrays the father and rapes the son. Another Boeotian pederastic myth is the story of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

According to Plutarch, Theban pederasty was instituted as an educational device for boys in order to "soften, while they were young, their natural fierceness, and to "temper the manners and characters of the youth".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of [[Pelopidas]]''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a tradition, The [[Sacred Band of Thebes]] comprised pederastic couples.&lt;ref&gt;David Leitao, 'The legend of the Theban Band', in M. Craven Nussbaum and J. Sihvola ''The Sleep of Reason'': Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome'', Chicago University Press (2002), pages 140-50''&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeotian pottery, in contrast to that of Athens, does not exhibit the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#In art|three types of pederastic scenes]] identified by Beazley. The limited survival and cataloguing of pottery that can be proven to have been made in Boeotia diminishes the value of this evidence in distinguishing a specifically local tradition of ''paiderastia''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hupperts, "Boeotian Swine: Homosexuality in Boeotia" in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity,'' p. 190 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPZu3Ktu5cC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=%22we+notice+that+we+do+not+find+on+the+Boeotian+vases%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22we%20notice%20that%20we%20do%20not%20find%20on%20the%20Boeotian%20vases%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern scholarship==
The ethical views held in ancient societies, such as [[Athens]], [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], [[Crete]], [[Sparta]], [[Elis]] and others, on the practice of pederasty have been explored by scholars only since the end of the 19th century. One of the first to do so was [[John Addington Symonds]], who wrote his seminal work ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'' in 1873, but after a private edition of 10 copies (1883) only in 1901 could the work really be published, in revised form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lgbt/pge/index.htm A Problem in Greek Ethics Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Carpenter]] expanded the scope of the study, with his 1914 work, ''Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk''. The text examines homoerotic practices of all types, not only pederastic ones, and ranges over cultures spanning the whole globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lgbt/itp/index.htm Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Germany the work was continued by classicist Paul Brandt writing under the pseudonym Hans Licht, who published his ''Sexual Life in Ancient Greece'' in 1932.

Mainstream [[Ancient Greek]] studies however had historically omitted references of the widespread practice of [[homosexuality]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[E. M. Forster]]'s 1914 novel [[Maurice (novel)|''Maurice'']] makes reference to modern European ambivalence toward this aspect of ancient Greek culture in a scene where a [[Cambridge]] professor, leading a group of students in translating an ancient Greek text says, "Omit the reference to the unspeakable vice of the Greeks."   Later in the 1940s H. Mitchell wrote: "This aspect of Greek morals is an extraordinary one, into which, for the sake of our equanimity, it is unprofitable to pry too closely". It would not be until 1978 and [[Kenneth Dover|K. J. Dover]]'s book ''[[Greek Homosexuality (book)|Greek Homosexuality]],'' that the topic would be widely and frankly discussed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Dover's work triggered a number of debates which still continue. Sociologist of the 20th century [[Michel Foucault]] declared that pederasty was "problematized" in Greek culture, that it was "the object of a special—and especially intense—moral preoccupation", which was "subjected to an interplay of positive and negative interplays so complex as to make the ethics that governed it difficult to decipher",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Masterson|author2=Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz|author3=James Robson|title=Sex in Antiquity: Exploring Gender and Sexuality in the Ancient World|date=5 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317602774 |page=115 |edition=revised |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k1G2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on concern with the chastity/moderation of the ''erōmenos'' (the term used for the "beloved" youth).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} A modern line of thought leading from Dover to Foucault to Halperin holds that the erōmenos did not reciprocate the love and desire of the erastes, and that the relationship was factored on a sexual domination of the younger by the older, a politics of penetration held to be true of all adult male Athenians' relations with their social inferiors—boys, women and slaves—a theory propounded also by Eva Keuls.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Keuls, ''The Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens,'' 1985&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, the relationships are characterized and factored on a power differential between the participants, and as essentially asymmetrical.

Other scholars point to artwork on vases, poetry and philosophical works such as the Platonic discussion of [[anteros]], "love returned", all of which show tenderness and desire and love on the part of the eromenos matching and responding to that of the erastes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Critics of Dover and his followers also point out that they ignore all material which argued against their "overly theoretical" interpretation of a human and emotional relationship&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, ''The Greeks and Greek Love,'' Orion, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and counter that "Clearly, a mutual, consensual bond was formed",&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Koehl, "Ephoros and Ritualized Homosexuality in Bronze Age Crete", in ''Queer Representations: Reading Livers, Reading Cultures;'' Martin Duberman, ed. New York University, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is "a modern fairy tale that the younger eromenos was never aroused".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html Hein van Dolen, ''Greek homosexuality'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Halperin's position has been criticized as a "persistently negative and judgmental rhetoric implying exploitation and domination as the fundamental characteristics of pre-modern sexual models" and challenged as a polemic of "mainstream assimilationist gay apologists" and an attempt to "demonize and purge from the movement" all non-orthodox male sexualities, especially that involving adults and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, "Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2003.09.22" of David M. Halperin's ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality''[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2003/.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As classical historian [[Robin Osborne]] has pointed out, historical discussion of ''paiderastia'' is complicated by 21st-century moral standards:&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is the historian's job to draw attention to the personal, social, political and indeed moral issues behind the literary and artistic representations of the Greek world. The historian's job is to present pederasty and all, to make sure that … we come face to face with the way [[To Helen#Revised 1845 version|the glory that was Greece]] was part of a world in which many of our own [[value system|core values]] find themselves challenged rather than reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Osborne]], ''Greek History'' (Routledge, 2004), pp. 12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4baOPEunQgoC&amp;pg=PA12 online] and 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public awareness of science''' ('''PAwS'''), '''public understanding of science''' ('''PUS'''), or more recently, '''Public Engagement with Science and Technology''' ('''PEST''') are terms relating to the attitudes, behaviours, opinions, and activities that comprise the relations between the general public or lay society as a whole to scientific knowledge and organisation. It is a comparatively new approach to the task of exploring the multitude of relations and linkages [[science]], [[technology]], and [[innovation]] have among the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savaget|first1=Paulo|last2=Acero|first2=Liliana|title=Plurality in understandings of innovation, sociotechnical progress and sustainable development: An analysis of OECD expert narratives|journal=Public Understanding of Science|year=2017|doi=10.1177/0963662517695056}}&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier work in the discipline had focused on augmenting public knowledge of scientific topics, in line with the [[information deficit model]] of [[science communication]], the discrediting of the model has led to an increased emphasis on how the public [[uses and gratifications theory|chooses to use]] scientific knowledge and on the development of interfaces to mediate between [[expertise|expert]] and [[layperson|lay]] understandings of an issue.{{examples|date=October 2015}}

== Major themes ==
The area integrates a series of fields and themes such as:
* [[Science communication]] in the [[mass media]], [[Internet]], [[radio]] and [[television]] programmes
* [[Science museums]], [[aquarium|aquaria]], [[planetarium|planetaria]], [[zoo|zoological parks]], [[botanical garden]]s, etc.
* Public controversies over science and technology
* Fixed and mobile science exhibits
* [[Science festival]]s
* [[Science fair]]s in schools and social groups
* [[Science education]] for adults
* Science and [[social movement]]s
* Media and science ([[Mediatization (media)|medialisation]] of science)
* [[Consumer education]]
* [[Citizen science]]
* Public tours of [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) parks, manufacturing companies, etc.
* [[Science in popular culture]]
* Science in text books and classrooms
* Science and art

How to raise public awareness and public understanding of science and technology, and how the public feels and knows about science in general, and specific subjects, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[bioethics]], etc., are important lines of research in this area. Professor of communication, Matthew Nisbet, points up the challenge, for example, in terms of the paradox of the success of science and engineering creating the conditions that have led to the trust or distrust of experts among certain populations and that the correlation appears to be more socioeconomic than religious or ideological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Divided Expectations: Why We Need a New Dialogue about Science, Inequality, and Society |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=18-19 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619185052/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/divided_expectations |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bodmer report==
The publication of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]]' report ''The Public Understanding of Science&lt;ref name=RS-Bodmer-report&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Royal Society|title=The Public Understanding of Science|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/1985/public-understanding-science/|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' (or ''Bodmer Report'') in 1985 is widely held to be the birth of the Public Understanding of Science movement in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD004707.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report led to the foundation of the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] and a cultural change in the attitude of scientists to outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm#n26|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contextualist model ==
In the 1990s, a new perspective emerged in the field with the classic study of [[Cumbria]]n Sheep Farmers' interaction with the Nuclear scientists in [[England]], where [[Brian Wynne]] demonstrated how the experts were ignorant or disinterested in taking into account the lay knowledge of the sheep farmers while conducting field experiments on the impact of the [[Chernobyl]] Nuclear fall out on the sheep in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wynne|first=Brian|date=1996|chapter=Misunderstood Misunderstandings: Social Identities and the Public Uptake of Science|url=|editors=Alan Irwin and Brian Wynne |title=Misunderstanding Science? The Public Reconstruction of Science and Technology |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=19–46|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this shortcoming from the side of the scientists, local farmers lost their trust in them. The experts were unaware of the local environmental conditions and the behaviour of sheep and this has eventually led to the failure of their experimental models. Following this study, scholars have studies similar micro-sociological contexts of expert-lay interaction and proposed that the context of knowledge communication is important to understand public engagement with science. Instead of large scale public opinion surveys, researchers proposed studies informed by [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK)]]. The contextualist model focuses on the social impediments in the  bidirectional flow of scientific knowledge between experts and laypersons/communities.

== The deliberative turn ==
The scholarly debate on public engagement with science developed further into analyzing the deliberations on science  through various institutional forms, with the help of the theory of deliberative democracy. Public deliberation of and participation in science practiced through public spheres became a major emphasis. Scholars like [[Sheila Jasanoff]] argues for wider public deliberation on science in democratic societies which is a basic condition for decision making regarding science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jasanoff|first=Sheila|date=2003|title=Breaking the Waves in Science Studies: Comment on H.M. Collins and Robert Evans, 'The Third Wave of Science Studies'|url=|journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=389–400|doi=10.1177/03063127030333004|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also attempts to develop more inclusive participatory models of technological governance in the form of consensus conferences, citizen juries, extended peer reviews, and deliberative mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lövbrand, Eva, Roger Pielke, Jr. and Silke Beck|first=|date=2011|title=A Democracy Paradox in Studies of Science and Technology|url=|journal=Science, Technology and Human Values |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=474–496|doi=10.1177/0162243910366154|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring public understanding of science ==
Social scientists use various metrics to measure public understanding of science, including:

=== 1. Factual knowledge ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Recognition: Answering a specific question by selecting the correct answer out a list&lt;ref name="Eveland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eveland|first1=William|title=How Web Site Organization Influences Free Recall, Factual Knowledge, and Knowledge Structure Density|journal=Human Communications Research|volume=30|issue=2|pages=208–233|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2004.tb00731.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Cued Recall]]: Answering a specific question without a list of choices &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Free Recall]]: After exposure to information, the study participant produces a list of as much of the information as they can remember &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* The more individual pieces of information a person is able to retrieve, the more that person is considered to have learned &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== 2. Self-reported knowledge, perceived knowledge, or perceived familiarity ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Scaled survey responses to questions such as "How well informed you would say you are about this topic?"&lt;ref name ="Ladwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig|first1=Peter|title=Perceived familiarity or factual knowledge? Comparing operationalizations of scientific understanding|journal=Science and Public Policy|volume=39|pages=761–774|doi=10.1093/scipol/scs048}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* Emphasizes the value of knowledge of one’s knowledge &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;

=== 3. Structural knowledge: ===
The nature of connections among different pieces of information in memory &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Asking study participants to assess relationships among concepts. For example, participants free recall concepts onto the first row and column of a matrix, then indicate whether the concepts are related to each other by placing an “X” in the cell if they are not. Participants then rank the remaining open cells by their relatedness from 1 (only very weakly) to 7 (very strongly related) &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
* Study participants answer questions designed to measure elaboration involved in a task, such as “I tried to relate the ideas I read about to my own past experiences” &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key Assumptions: ====
* The use of [[Elaborative interrogation|elaboration]] increases the likelihood of remembering information &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== Mixed use of the three measures ===
* While some studies purport that factual and perceived knowledge can be viewed as the same construct, a 2012 study investigating public knowledge of nanotechnology supports separating their use in communications research, as they “do not reflect the same underlying knowledge structures." &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt; Correlations between them were found to be low, and they were not predicted by the same factors. For example different types of science media use (television versus online) predicted different constructs &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;
* Factual knowledge has been shown to be empirically distinct from structural knowledge &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

== Project examples ==
Government and private-led campaigns and events, such as [[Dana Foundation]]'s "[[Brain Awareness Week]]," are becoming a strong focus of programmes which try to promote public awareness of science.

The UK PAWS Foundation dramatically went as far as establishing a Drama Fund with the BBC in 1994. The purpose was to encourage and support the creation of new drama for television, drawing on the world of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=PAWS off science?|journal=Physics Education|date=January 1998|volume=33|issue=1|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/33/1/011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vega Science Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vega.org.uk|title=The Vega Science Trust - Science Video - Homepage|work=vega.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 1994 to promote science through the media of television and the internet with the aim of giving scientists a platform from which to communicate to the general public.

The [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science]] chair at [[The University of Oxford]] was established in 1995 for the [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|title=Professor Richard Dawkins - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514025233/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an endowment from [[Charles Simonyi]]. Mathematician [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has held the chair since Dawkins' retirement in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|title=Professor Marcus du Sautoy - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181656/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|archivedate=2010-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar professorships have since been created at other British universities. Professorships in the field have been held by well-known academics including [[Richard Fortey]] and [[Kathy Sykes]] at the [[University of Bristol]], [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] at [[Manchester University]], [[Tanya Byron]] at [[Edge Hill University]], [[Jim Al-Khalili]] at the [[University of Surrey]] and [[Alice Roberts]] at the [[University of Birmingham]].

A '''public figure''' is a person such as a [[politician]], [[celebrity]], or business leader, who has a certain [[social position]] within a certain scope and a significant influence and so is often widely concerned by the public, can benefit enormously from society, and is closely related to [[public interest]]s in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrari|first=Anne|date=2016-08-10|title=Using Celebrities in Abnormal Psychology as Teaching Tools to Decrease Stigma and Increase Help Seeking|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0098628316662765|journal=Teaching of Psychology|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=329–333|doi=10.1177/0098628316662765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[defamation]] actions (libel and slander) as well as [[invasion of privacy]], a public figure cannot succeed in a lawsuit on incorrect harmful statements in the [[United States]] unless there is proof that the writer or publisher acted with [[actual malice]] by knowing the falsity or by reckless disregard for the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shiffrin|first=Steven H.|title=The First Amendment|year=2006|publisher=Thomson/ West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0-314-16256-4|pages=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal [[burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] in defamation actions is thus higher in the case of a public figure than in the case of an ordinary person.

==Overview==
The controlling [[precedent]] in the [[United States]] was set in 1964 by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', which is considered a key decision in supporting the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and [[freedom of the press]].

A fairly high threshold of public activity is necessary to elevate people to a public figure status. Typically, they must either be:
* a '''public figure''', a public official or any other person pervasively involved in public affairs, or
* a '''limited purpose public figure''', those who have "thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved." A "particularized determination" is required to decide whether a person is a limited purpose public figure, which can be variously interpreted:&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;Aaron Larson: [https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/defamation.html#3 Defamation, Libel and Slander Law]. Expertlaw.com, August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A person can become an "involuntary public figure" as the result of publicity, even though that person did not want or invite the public attention. For example, people accused of high profile crimes may be unable to pursue actions for defamation even after their innocence is established....

A person can also become a "limited public figure" by engaging in actions which generate publicity within a narrow area of interest. For example, [jokes about]... [[Terry Rakolta]] [an activist who spearheaded a boycott of the show ''[[Married... with Children]]''] were [[fair comment]]s... within the confines of her public conduct [and] protected by Ms. Rakolta's status as a "limited public figure".}}
Discussion of a person on the Internet may at times rise to the level that it causes the subject of discussion to be treated as an involuntary public figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dotinga|first1=Randy|title=Are You a 'Public Figure'?|url=https://www.wired.com/2005/11/are-you-a-public-figure/|publisher=Wired|date=9 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations are not automatically treated as public figures, and defamation claims made by corporations are evaluated under the same standard as those made by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Defamation Law|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/defamation|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of secrecy laws, a '''public interest defence''' is a [[defense (legal)|defence]] that allows a [[defendant]] who disclosed classified or protected information to avoid criminality by establishing that the public interest in disclosure of the information outweighs the public interest in nondisclosure. It is aimed at protecting [[whistleblower]]s of government misconduct. 

The inclusion of the defence was a subject of debate in the legislative process of the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. The defence was not included in the final Act. The defence was also absent in secrecy laws in other countries that were based on the Act. 

[[Canada]] has reformed its secrecy laws in 2001 by adding the defence in its [[Security of Information Act]]. However, its application is limited to situations in which the [[defendant]] has followed a series of steps set out in the legislation before making the disclosure, and the person's purpose in making the disclosure is to reveal an offence committed by another person in his official duties.

The inclusion of the defence has been a subject of debate in [[Hong Kong]] in 2003 during its legislative process to implement [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23 of the Basic Law]] in the [[media in Hong Kong]].

'''Public water system''' is a regulatory term used in the United States and Canada, referring to certain [[Public utility|utilities]] and organizations providing [[drinking water]].

==United States==
The US [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] and derivative legislation define "public water system" as an entity that provides "[[Drinking water|water for human consumption]] through pipes or other constructed conveyances to at least 15 service connections or serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year."&lt;ref name="SDWA background"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/background-drinking-water-standards-safe-drinking-water-act-sdwa |title=Background on Drinking Water Standards in the Safe Drinking Water Act |date=2015-12-23 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "public" in "public water system" refers to the people drinking the water, not to the ownership of the system.

Some US states (e.g. [[New York (state)|New York]]) have varying definitions.
&lt;!-- The [[European Union]] appears to have a different definition for "public water '''supply'''": a water supply which is in the charge or ownership of a sanitary authority or any person acting jointly with it or on its behalf under contract.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsai.ie/legislation/food/eu_docs/Water/SI278_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Over 286 million Americans get their tap water from a community water system. Eight percent of the community water systems—large municipal water systems—provide water to 82 percent of the US population.&lt;ref name="CDCPWS"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA (2013-04-04). [https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/index.html "Public Water Systems."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subcategorization===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has defined three types of public water systems:
* '''Community Water System''' (CWS). A public water system that supplies water to the same population year-round.
* '''Non-Transient Non-Community Water System''' (NTNCWS). A public water system that regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people at least six months per year, but not year-round. Some examples are schools, factories, office buildings, and [[hospital]]s which have their own water systems.
* '''Transient Non-Community Water System''' (TNCWS). A public water system that provides water in a place such as a [[gas station]] or [[campground]] where people do not remain for long periods of time.

There are over 150,000 public water systems.
* Approximately 52,000 CWS serve the majority of the U.S. population
* Approximately 85,000 NTNCWS
* Approximately 18,000 TNCWS.&lt;ref name="SDWA background"/&gt;

EPA also classifies water systems according to the number of people they serve:
* Very Small water systems serve 25-500 people
* Small water systems serve 501-3,300 people
* Medium water systems serve 3,301-10,000 people
* Large water systems serve 10,001-100,000 people
* Very Large water systems serve over 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://echo.epa.gov/help/drinking-water-dashboard-help |title=Drinking Water Dashboard Help |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-05 |website=Enforcement and Compliance History Online |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water systems may be categorized by their source of water:
*[[Groundwater]], generally from [[Water well|wells]]
*[[Surface water]] and groundwater "under the influence" of surface water
*Purchase of water from another Public Water System.

===Water-related diseases and contaminants in public water systems===
Sources of drinking water are subject to contamination and require appropriate treatment to remove disease-causing contaminants. Contamination of drinking water supplies can occur in the source water as well as in the distribution system after water treatment has already occurred. There are many sources of water contamination, including naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (for example, [[arsenic]], [[radon]], [[uranium]]), local land use practices (application of [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s; [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s), manufacturing processes, and [[Sewer overflow (disambiguation)|sewer overflow]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; or [[water pollution|wastewater]] releases.

The presence of contaminants in water can lead to adverse health effects, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;CDC (2013). [https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/water_diseases.html "Water-related Diseases and Contaminants in Public Water Systems."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] publishes a list of the leading causes of waterborne outbreaks in public water systems.&lt;ref name="CDCPWS" /&gt;

==Canada==
The Canadian provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[Nova Scotia]] also use this definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Province of Manitoba|location=Winnipeg, MB|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/d101e.php|title=The Drinking Water Safety Act|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Province of Nova Scotia|location=Halifax, NS|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/JUST/REGULATIONS/regs/envwaste.htm|title=Water and Wastewater Facilities and Public Drinking Water Supplies Regulations|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13546">'''Quantum coin flipping''' uses the principles of [[quantum mechanics]] to encrypt messages for secure communication.  Unlike in other types of [[quantum cryptography]], quantum coin flipping is a protocol used between two users who do not trust each other.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography"&gt;Stuart Mason Dambort, [https://phys.org/news/2014-05-tails-experimental-quantum-coin-flipping.html "Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography performs better than classical protocols"], ''Phys.org'', March 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Since the players do not trust each other, they both want to win the coin toss and, thus, they will try to cheat in various ways.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

Quantum coin flipping and other types of quantum cryptography communicate information through the transmission of [[qubits]]. The accepting player does not know the information in the qubit until he performs a measurement.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing"&gt;C. Döscher and M. Keyl, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0206088.pdf "An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing"], ''Cornell University Library'', February 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The security of quantum cryptography is in the qubits. In each of the qubits, information is carried by a single [[photon]].&lt;ref name= "Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography"&gt;Vivek R and Dr. J. Roopchand, [http://www.ijcta.com/documents/volumes/vol3issue4/ijcta2012030417.pdf “Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography – A Survey"], ''International Journal of Computer Technology and Applications'', August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Once the receiving player measures the photon, it is altered and will not measure the same way again.&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt; The fact that a photon can only be read the same way once allows for an easy detection of any other party attempting to intercept the message.&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt;

Quantum coin flipping is a secure means of communicating in theory, but difficult to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt;

==History==
Manuel Blum introduced coin flipping as part of a classical system in 1983.&lt;ref name="A New Protocol and Lower Bounds for Quantum Coin Flipping"&gt;Andris Ambainis, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0204022.pdf "A New Protocol and Lower Bounds for Quantum Coin Flipping"], ''Cornell University Library'', April 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Blum’s coin flipping protocol was based on computational algorithms and assumptions.&lt;ref name="A New Protocol and Lower Bounds for Quantum Coin Flipping" /&gt; Blum’s version of coin flipping answers the cryptographic problem in the example:

:Alice and Bob are recently divorced, living in two separate cities, and want to decide who gets to keep the car. To decide, Alice wants to flip a coin over the telephone. However, Bob is concerned that if he were to tell Alice heads, she would flip the coin and automatically tell him that he lost.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing" /&gt;

Thus, the problems with Alice and Bob are that they do not trust each other, the only resource they have is the telephone communication channel, and there is not a third party available to read the coin.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing" /&gt; The only way that Alice and Bob can exchange information is if they are both being truthful and agree on a value or until one of them is convinced that the other is cheating.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing" /&gt;

In 1984, [[quantum cryptography]] emerged in the paper written by Charles H. Bennett and Giles Brassard. In this paper, the two introduced the idea of using quantum mechanics to enhance previous cryptographic protocols such as coin flipping.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt; Since 1984, many researchers have applied quantum mechanics to cryptography as they have proven theoretically to be more secure than classical cryptography.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt; However, demonstrating these protocols, like quantum coin flipping, in practical systems has been difficult to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

As published in 2014, a group of scientists at the Laboratory for Communication and Processing of Information (LTCI) in Paris have implemented quantum coin flipping protocols experimentally.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt; The researchers have reported that the protocol performs better than a classical system over a suitable distance for a metropolitan area optical network.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

==Coin flipping protocol==
Quantum coin flipping is when random qubits are generated between two players that do not trust each other because both of them want to win the coin toss, which could lead them to cheat in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt; The essence of coin flipping occurs when the two players issue a sequence of instructions over a communication channel that then eventually results in an output.&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt;

A basic quantum coin flipping protocol involves two people: Alice and Bob.&lt;ref name="Experimental Plug and Play Quantum Coin Flipping"&gt;Anna Pappa et al., [http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4717 "Experimental Plug and Play Quantum Coin Flipping"], ''Nature Communications'', April 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Alice sends Bob a set number of Κ photon pulses in the quantum states | Φ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;. Each of these photon pulses is independently prepared following a random choice by Alice of basis α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and bit c&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''i'' = 1, 2, 3…Κ. 
# Bob then measures the pulses from Alice by identifying a random basis β&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Bob records these photons and then reports back the first successfully measured photon ''j'' to Alice along with a random bit ''b''. 
# Alice reveals the basis and bit that she used at the basis Bob gave her. If the two bases and bits match, then both parties are truthful and can exchange information. If the bit reported by Bob is different than that of Alice’s, one is not being truthful.

[[File:Quantum Coin Flipping Protocol.png|thumb|Alice decides her random basis and sequence of qubits. She then sends the qubits as photons to Bob via the quantum channel. Bob detects these qubits and records his results in a table. Based on the table, Bob makes his guess to Alice on what basis she used.]]

A more general explanation of the above protocol is as follows:&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing"&gt;Charles H. Bennett and Giles Brassard, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397514004241?np=y&amp;npKey=9d7c391743e27ff2d85b36896983c21b907525570b2ae94fadb8c09ad21600ca "Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing"], ''Theoretical Computer Science'', December 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alice first chooses a random basis (such as diagonally) and a sequence of random qubits. Alice then encodes her chosen qubits as a sequence of photons following the chosen basis. She then sends these qubits as a train of polarized photons to Bob through the communication channel.
# Bob chooses a sequence of reading bases randomly for each individual photon. He then reads the photons and records the results in two tables. One table is of the rectilinear (horizontal or vertical) received photons and one of the diagonally received photons. Bob may have holes in his tables due to losses in his detectors or in the transmission channels. Based on this table, Bob makes a guess as to which basis Alice used and announces his guess to Alice. If he guessed correctly, he wins and if not, he loses.
# Alice reports whether he won or not by announcing what basis she used to Bob. Alice then confirms the information by sending Bob her entire original qubit sequence that she used in step 1.
# Bob compares Alice’s sequence with his tables to confirm that no cheating occurred on Alice’s part. The tables should correspond to Alice’s basis and there should be no correlation with the other table.

The key issue with coin flipping is that it occurs between two distrustful parties.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; These two parties are communicating through the communication channel some distance from each other and they have to agree on a winner or loser with each having a 50 percent chance of winning.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; However, since they are distrustful of one another, cheating is likely to occur. Cheating can occur in a number of ways such as claiming they lost some of the message when they do not like the result or increasing the average number of photons contained in each of the pulses.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

For Bob to cheat, he would have to be able to guess Alice’s basis with a probability greater than ½.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; In order to accomplish this, Bob would have to be able to determine a train of photons randomly polarized in one basis from a train of photons polarized in another basis.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt;

Alice, on the other hand, could cheat in a couple of different ways, but she has to be careful because Bob could easily detect them as cheating.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; When Bob sends a correct guess to Alice, she could convince Bob that her photons are actually polarized the opposite of Bob’s correct guess.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; Alice could also send Bob a different original sequence than she actually used in order to beat Bob.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt;

===Detecting a third-party===
Single photons are used to pass the information from one player to the other (qubits).&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt; In this protocol, the information is encoded in the single photons with polarization directions of 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees, non-orthogonal quantum states.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; When a third party attempts to read or gain information on the transmission, they alter the photon’s polarization in a random way that is likely detected by the two players because it does not match the pattern exchanged between the two legitimate users.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt;

==Implementation==
===Experimental===
As mentioned in the history section, scientists at the LTCI in Paris have experimentally carried out a quantum coin flipping protocol, giving an example of using quantum coin flipping. Previous protocols called for a single photon source or an entangled source to be secure. However, these sources are why it is difficult for quantum coin flipping to be implemented. Instead the researchers at LTCI used the effects of [[quantum superposition]] rather than a single photon source, which they claim makes implementation easier with the standard photon sources available.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

These researchers used the Clavis2 platform developed by IdQuantique for their protocol. The researchers had to modify the Clavis2 system to get it to work for the coin flipping protocol. The experimental setup they used with the Clavis2 system, involves a two-way approach. Light pulsed at 1550&amp;nbsp;nanometres is sent from Bob to Alice. Alice then uses a phase modulator to encrypt the information. After encryption, she then uses a Faraday mirror to reflect and attenuate the pulses at her chosen level and sends them back to Bob. Using two high quality single photon detectors, Bob chooses a measurement basis in his phase modulator to detect the pulses from Alice.&lt;ref name="Experimental Plug and Play Quantum Coin Flipping" /&gt;

They replaced the detectors on Bob’s side because of the low detection efficiencies of the previous detectors. When they replaced the detectors, they were able to show a quantum advantage on a channel for over {{convert|15|km|mi}}. A couple of other challenges the group faced was reprogramming the system because photon source attenuation was high and performing system analyses to identify losses and errors in system components. With these corrections, the scientists were capable of implementing a coin flipping protocol by introducing a small honest abort probability, the probability that two honest participants cannot obtain a coin flip at the end of the protocol, but at a short communication distance.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

'''Rebecca Ann Naylor Hazard''' (née '''Rebecca Ann Naylor'''; November 10, 1826 - March 1, 1912) was a 19th-century American philanthropist, [[suffragette]], reformer, and writer from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. With a few other women, she formed the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri and an Industrial Home for Girls in [[St. Louis]]. She organized a society known as the [[Freedmen's Aid Society]], and served as president of the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]].

==Early life and education==
Rebecca Naylor was born in [[Woodsfield, Ohio]], November 10, 1826, the daughter of Robert F. Naylor (born in Pennsylvania, but lived mostly in Virgini) and Mary Bettis Archbold (of Virginia).{{sfn|Yale University. Class of 1867|1897|p=335}} Till the age of 14, she studied at Monroe Institute and the Marietta Seminary.{{sfn|Garraty|Carnes|1999|p=441}} The family then removed to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and later to [[Quincy, Illinois]]. In Quincy, in 1844, while still a teenager, she married William Tweedy Hazard, of [[Newport, Rhode Island]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} 

==Career==
The husband was not a college man. His occupation during most of his life was that of a manufacturer (flour mills).{{sfn|Yale University. Class of 1867|1897|p=335}} Five children were born to the couple. In 1850, the family removed to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. For many years, domestic affairs claimed the attention of Hazard.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} 

===Philanthropist===
In 1854, she united with other women in establishing an Industrial Home for Girls in St. Louis. For five years she was on the board of managers of that institution, which has sheltered thousands of homeless children. At the breaking out of the [[American Civil War]], Hazard, who was an ardent [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]], engaged in hospital work, including the care of sick and wounded soldiers. She helped to organize the Union Aid Society and served as a member of the executive committee in the great Western Sanitary Fair. Finding that large numbers of African American women and children were by the exigencies of war helplessly stranded in the city, Hazard sought means for their relief. They were in a deplorable condition, and, as the supplies contributed to the soldiers could not be used for them, she organized a society known as the [[Freedmen's Aid Society]], for their special benefit. At the close of the war, that society was merged in an orphan asylum. Closely following that work came the establishment of a home for women, which was maintained under great difficulties for some years, before being abandoned. With [[Mary Foote Henderson]], Hazard co-founded the School of Design for women in the field of decorative art. It later became part of the Woman’s Exchange.{{sfn|Garraty|Carnes|1999|p=441}}

===Suffragist and writer===
Deeply impressed with the disabilities under which women labor in being deprived of political rights, Hazard, [[Virginia Minor]], [[Anna Clapp]], [[Lucretia Hall]], and [[Penelope Allen]],&lt;ref name="shsmo.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Virginia Minor|url=http://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/m/minor/|publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; met in May 1867, and formed the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri, the first society bearing the name, and having for its sole object the ballot for woman. Devoted to this cause, Hazard gave it her attention for many years, filling the various offices of the association, and also serving one term as president of the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]]. In 1870, the city of St. Louis, falling under evil counsels, framed into law the Social Evil Ordinance. Realizing the danger to good morals, Hazard at once engaged in the conflict for the overthrow of law. Three years later, she met with other women and organized an appeal to the legislature through a petition campaign to rescind it.{{sfn|Graves|2014|p=46-47}} The law was repealed by the [[Missouri Legislature]] in 1874. The call for the formation of the association for the advancement of women, known as the Woman's Congress, was signed by Hazard, and she continued to be a member of that body, contributing at various times to its sessions the following papers: "Home Studies for Women," "Business Opportunities for Women," and "Crime and its Punishment."{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} 

==Later years==
After the death of her husband, in 1879, Hazard mostly retired from public work, but at her home in [[Kirkwood, Missouri]], a suburb of St. Louis, a class of women met each week for study and mutual improvement. As a result of these studies, Hazard published two papers on the "Divina Commedia." She also wrote a volume on the war period in St. Louis. Her contributions to local and other papers were numerous.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} Hazard was a member of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] and of the [[American Akademe]], a philosophical society having headquarters in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} She died in Kirkwood in 1912.{{sfn|Christensen|Foley|Kremer|1999|p=387}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19872">'''Regulatory focus theory''' ('''RFT''') is a [[goal]] pursuit [[theory]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Cesario, J: "Regulatory fit and persuasion: Basic principles and remaining questions", Social and Personality Psychology Compass 2(1)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|444}} formulated by [[Columbia University]] [[psychology]] [[professor]] and [[researcher]] [[E. Tory Higgins]] regarding people's [[perceptions]] in the [[decision making]] process. RFT examines the relationship between the [[motivation]] of a person and the way in which they go about achieving their [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E: "Making a Good Decision: Value From Fit", ''American Psychologist'' 55(11):1217&lt;/ref&gt; RFT posits two separate and independent self-regulatory orientations: prevention and promotion (Higgins, 1997).

This psychological [[theory]], like many others, is applied in [[communication]], specifically in the subfields of [[nonverbal communication]] and [[persuasion]].Chronic regulatory focus is measured using the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (Higgins et al., 2001) or the Regulatory Strength measure. Momentary regulatory focus can be primed or induced.

==Background==

===Regulatory fit theory===
To understand RFT, it is important to understand another of [[E. Tory Higgins]]' [[theories]]: regulatory fit theory. When a person believes that there is "fit", they will involve themselves more in what they are doing and "feel right" about it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Higgins, E. T. (2005). Value From Regulatory Fit. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14(4), 209–213. {{doi|10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}  Regulatory fit should not directly affect the [[hedonic]] occurrence of a thing or occasion, but should influence a person's assurance in their reaction to the [[Object (philosophy)|object]] or event.

Regulatory fit theory suggests that a match between orientation to a goal and the means used to approach that goal produces a state of regulatory fit that both creates a feeling of rightness about the goal pursuit and increases task engagement (Higgins, 2001, 2005). Regulatory fit intensifies responses, such as the value of a chosen object, persuasion, and job satisfaction&lt;ref&gt;Kruglanski, A. W., Pierro, A., &amp; Higgins, E. T. (2007). Regulatory Mode and Preferred Leadership Styles: How Fit Increases Job Satisfaction. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 29(2), 137–149. {{doi|10.1080/01973530701331700}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Regulatory fit does not increase the assessment of a [[decision making|decision]]; instead when someone feels "right" about their decision, the [[experience]] of "correctness and importance" is transferred to the ensuing assessment of the chosen [[Object (philosophy)|object]], increasing its superficial worth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Avnet, T: "Locomotion, assessment, and regulatory fit: Value transfer from 'how' to 'what'", Journal of Experimental Psychology 39(5):525&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the "feeling right" [[experience]] can then sway [[retrospective]] or prospective evaluations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Regulatory fit can be manipulated incidentally (outside the context of interest) or integrally (within the context of interest).

===Definition===
RFT refers to when a person pursues a [[goal]] in a way that maintains the person's own personal [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[beliefs]], also known as ''regulatory orientation''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This [[theory]] operates on the basic [[principle]] that people embrace [[pleasure]] but avoid [[suffering|pain]], and they then maintain their regulatory fit based on this standard.

The ''regulatory focus'' is basically the way in which someone approaches pleasure but avoids pain. An individual's regulatory focus concentrates on desired end-states, and the approach [[motivation]] used to go from the current state to the desired end-state. This theory differentiates between a ''promotion-focus'' on [[hope]]s and accomplishments, also known as gains. This focus is more concerned with higher level gains such as advancement and accomplishment.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;Higgins, E: "Achievement orientations from subjective histories of success: promotion pride versus prevention pride", ''European Journal of Social Psychology''. 31(1):4&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus is the ''prevention-focus'' based on [[safety]] and [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]], also known as non-losses. This focus emphasizes security and safety by following the guidelines and the rules.&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt;

These two regulatory focuses regulate the influences that a person would be exposed to in the [[decision-making]] process, and determine the different ways they achieve their goal, as discussed by RFT. An individual's regulatory orientation is not necessarily fixed. While individuals have [[Habit (psychology)|chronic]] tendencies towards either promotion or prevention, these preferences may not hold for all situations. Furthermore, a specific regulatory focus can be [[wikt:induce|induced]].

The [[Value (ethics)|value]] taken from interaction and goal attainment can be either positive or negative. The decision has positive value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that fits their regulatory orientation and it will have negative value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that does not fit their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Regulatory fit allows value to be created by intensifying the commitment, based on one of the regulatory focus orientations. Making [[choices]] and fulfilling [[objective (goal)|objective]]s are considered as activities, and with any activity, people can be more or less involved. When this involvement is strong, it can intensify the feelings and values about this activity, and the approach to the activity determines whether they are or are not satisfied with the outcome and method of achieving the outcome.

This theory has noteworthy implications for increasing the value of life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} For example, in [[interpersonal]] conflict, if each person experiences "fit", each one will be satisfied with and committed to the outcome. In the broad sense, for people to appreciate their own lives, they need to be satisfied and "feel right" about what they are doing, and the way they are doing it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|210}} If it is not satisfying, it is known as "non-fit", and they will not reach their desired goal.

===Goal attainment and motivation===
Regulatory focus theory, according to Higgins, views motivation in a way that allows an understanding of the foundational ways we approach a task or a [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. (1997, December) Beyond pleasure and pain. ''American Psychologist'', 52(12):1281&lt;/ref&gt; Different factors can motivate people during goal pursuit, and we self-regulate our methods and processes during our goal pursuit. RFT proposes that motivational strength is enhanced when the manner in which people work toward a goal sustains their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel, S: "How regulatory fit enhances motivational strength during goal pursuit", European Journal of Social Psychology. 34(1):40&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving a goal in a way that is consistent to a person's regulatory orientation leads to an [[individual]] sense of importance to the event. The impact of [[motivation]] is considered calculated and this creates a greater sense of commitment to the goal. The more strongly an individual is engaged (i.e., involved, occupied, fully engrossed) in an activity, the more intense the motivational force experienced. Engagement is of great importance to attain and motivate in order to reach a goal. Engagement serves as intensifier of the directional component of the value experience. An individual who is strongly engaged in a goal pursuits will experience a positive target more positively and a negative target more negatively.

Individuals can pursue different goals with diverse regulatory orientations and in unlike ways. There are two different kinds of regulatory orientations that people use to obtain their goals: ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''. These terms are derived from [[E. Tory Higgins]]'s Theory of Regulatory Focus. In which, he adds to the notion that people regulate their goal-oriented behavior in two very distinct ways, coined ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''

[[E. Tory Higgins]] uses this example: there is Student A and Student B, and they both have the shared goal to make an ''A'' in a class they are both taking in college. Student A uses a ''promotion-focus orientation'' which slants them towards achieving their goal and towards advancement, growth and life accomplishment. This would cause Student A to view the goal as an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] that satisfies their need for accomplishment. Student B uses a ''prevention-focus orientation'' where the goal is something that should be realized because it fulfills their need for [[security]], [[Safety|protection]] and prevention of negative outcomes. Student A uses an eager approach where they read extra materials to obtain their goal of an ''A''. Student B uses a vigilant approach where they become more detail oriented and pay careful attention to completing all of the course requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, R., &amp; Buss, D. (2009). Personality psychology: domains of knowledge about human nature. (4th ed., p. 388).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Completed RFT flowchart 3.jpg]]

Both forms of regulatory orientation can work to fulfill goals, but the choice of [[orientation (mental)|orientation]] is based on individual [[preference]]s and style. When a person pursues their goal in the focus that fits their regulatory orientation, they are more likely to pursue their goal more eagerly and aggressively than if they were using the other focus.In this case each student has different styles. They both feel more comfortable in persuading their goal. The outcome in this experiment would have been different if the students were given an undesirable choice.

When people make decisions, they often envision the possible "[[pleasure]] or [[suffering|pain]]" of the possible outcomes that the focus orientation will produce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|209}} A person imagining making a pleasing choice is more likely to engage in promotion-focus orientation because envisioning the possible outcome of success maintains eagerness about the outcome but does not place importance on [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]]. A person imagining the possible [[suffering|pain]] by making an undesirable choice maintains more vigilance but less eagerness.

A person with promotion-focus orientation is more likely to remember the occasions where the goal is pursued by using eagerness approaches and less likely to remember occasions where the goal is pursued by vigilance approaches. A person with prevention-focus orientation is more likely to remember events where the goal is pursued by means of vigilance than if it was pursued using eagerness approaches.

==Application==

===Regulatory focus theory and persuasion===
When relating regulatory focus theory to [[persuasion]], it is important to remember that RFT is a [[goal]]-attainment [[theory]], and that RFT can spawn feelings of rightness/wrongness which in turn may produce formulations for [[judgment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, A: "'This story is right on': The impact of regulatory fit on narrative engagement and persuasion", European Journal of Social Psychology. 39:448&lt;/ref&gt;

The feelings of rightness give an [[individual]] more commitment to the [[information]] coming in and therefore can avoid endangering their regulatory fit which in turn changes their regulatory focus and accepting a probable motive to change. If a person experiences feelings of wrongness they will suffer negative [[emotion]]s and deem the [[experience]] 
and information as a [[threat]] to their regulatory fit and therefore a threat to their regulatory focus and their [[goal]].

Studies have been done where fit and focus have been applied to show their applicability to [[consumer]] [[purchasing]], health advisories, and [[social policy]] issues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}} To be persuaded is to change your prior feelings, actions, and/or beliefs on a matter to where you agree with the persuader.

The "fit" involved in RFT plays a large role in such issues and stories because it can be a device to help an [[individual]] receive and review the experience during a particular [[message]] delivery. [[Positive reinforcement]] and [[feeling]]s of rightness while decoding the [[message]] creates a stronger engagement and relationship with processing the [[message]], and [[negative reinforcement]] and feelings of wrongness lessens the engagement and [[Attachment theory|attachment]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}}

[[Researcher]]s found that targeting the two different regulatory focus orientations, and their coinciding types of fit, works as an effective process to aid in [[persuasive]] charm or pull when they introduced a manner of [[persuasion]] where the framing of the [[message]] was everything and the content was [[irrelevant]] to uphold or interrupt a person's regulatory fit and follow the pattern of logic used in regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}}

Lee and Aaker (2004) conducted an [[experiment]] that involved whether or not to give their information in a prevention-focus- or promotion-focus-concerning way. The study involved an [[advertisement]] for a grape juice drink, which they split into two to create prevention-focus concerns (disease-preventing) and then promotion-focus concerns (energy enhancement).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}} In doing so, they demonstrated that rather than trying to know each [[individual]] recipient's qualities, one needs only to start by nailing the focus (prevention/promotion) and then framing the [[message]] so that it creates that "rightness".

Some may confuse RFT with regulatory fit, regulatory relevance, message matching, and source attractiveness in such an example. The extent of similarities between closely related [[theories]] of RFT, such as ones stated above, make it hard to clarify when this theory is applicable or apparent in respect to the [[persuasion]] process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|444–5}}

===Regulatory focus theory and nonverbal communication===
RFT can be a useful outline for a better understanding of the effects of [[nonverbal]] cues in [[persuasion]] and [[impression formation]]. Regulatory Fit Theory suggests that the effect of a cue cannot be understood without remembering what the cue means given a recipient's focus orientation.&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"&gt;Cesario, J., Higgins, E. (2008 May) Making Message Recipients "Feel Right": How Nonverbal Cues Can Increase Persuasion. Psychological Science, 19(5)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|419}}

[[Nonverbal]] cues can be used by the [[message]] source to vary delivery style, more specifically to convey eagerness or vigilance, of a given message in a way that will produce regulatory fit in message recipients of different focus orientations.

Advancement implies eager movement forward, so eagerness is conveyed by gestures that involve animated, broad opening movements such as hand movements projecting outward, forward leaning body positions, fast body movement, and fast [[speech]] rate. Caution implies vigilant carefulness, so vigilance should be conveyed by [[gesture]]s that show precision like slightly backward-leaning body positions, slower body movement, and slower speech rate.

An eager [[nonverbal]] delivery style will result in greater [[message]] effectiveness for promotion-focus recipients than for prevention-focus recipients, while the opposite is true for a vigilant [[nonverbal]] style.

There are various aspects, which may contribute to whether or not a [[message]]'s [[persuasive]] element is successful. One aspect is the effect of [[nonverbal]] cues and their association with [[persuasive]] appeals based on the [[message]] recipient's [[motivation]]al regulatory orientation. This determines the recipient's impression of the source during [[impression formation]].

Research has found that [[nonverbal]] cues are an essential element of most [[persuasive]] appeals. RFT creates the background that allows a [[prediction]] for when and for whom a [[nonverbal]] cue can have an effect on [[persuasion]]. When [[nonverbal]] cues and signals are used appropriately, they increase the effectiveness of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"/&gt;{{rp|415}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23365">The '''societal marketing'''  is a marketing concept that holds that a company should make marketing decisions not only by considering consumers' wants, the company's requirements, but also  society's long-term interests.

The societal marketing concept holds that the organization's task is to determine the needs, wants, and interests of a [[target market]] and to deliver the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than [[competitors]] in a way that preserves or enhances the well being of both the individual consumer and society in general. Therefore, marketers must endeavor to satisfy the needs and wants of their target markets in ways that preserve and enhance the well-being of consumers and society as a whole. {{ref|Kotler2000}} It is closely linked with the principles of [[corporate social responsibility]] and of [[sustainable development]].

==Definition==
Societal marketing can be defined as a "marketing with a social dimension or marketing that includes non-economic criteria". &lt;ref&gt; Handelman, Jay M. and Arnold, Stephen J., "The Role of Marketing Actions with a Social Dimension: Appeals to the Institutional Environment," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 63, No. 3, July, 1999, pp 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;  Societal marketing "concerns for society's long term interests".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, G.R., "The Marketing Concept: Necessary but sufficient? An environmental view," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 24, No. 8, pp.23-30, https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000000612&lt;/ref&gt; It is about "the direct benefits for the organization and secondary benefit for the community". &lt;ref&gt;McColl-Kennedy, J., Kiel, G., Lusch, R. and Lusch, V., ''Marketing: Concepts and Strategies,'' Nelson Australia, Melbourne, 2001, &lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing distinguishes between the consumer's immediate satisfaction and longer term consumer and social benefits. Accordingly, [[Andreas Kaplan]] defines societal management as "management that takes into account society's overall welfare in addition to mere profitability considerations." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | issue=4 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534| year=2014 | last1=Kaplan | first1=Andreas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its a 3 dimensional concept of marketing ;Social welfare,Individual welfare,Company profits.

==Objectives== 
Various attempts to define the objectives of societal marketing have been noted,&lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, pp 42-47&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
* "[[Social responsibility]] implies that a business decision maker... is obliged to take actions that also protect and enhance society's interests.
* "Business has the responsibility to help [the consumer] ... It is the duty of business to promote proper consumption values."
* "Business leaders are mandated to adopt roles of leadership in  the advancement of our society to new levels of moral conduct."

==History==
The concept of societal marketing emerged in the early 1970s, promoting a more socially responsible, moral and ethical model of marketing in an effort to counter some of the more serious criticisms of marketing that had arisen out of the [[consumerism|consumerist]] movement around that time. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 36, No. 5/6, pp548-569, https://doi.org/10.1108/03090560210423014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Kotler]] is generally credited with introducing the societal marketing concept to the literature in a 1972 article "What Consumerism Means for Marketers" in the ''Harvard Business Review'' of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Reference, http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631233176_chunk_g978140510254422_ss1-48&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly Kotler believed that he had coined the term, "societal marketing" and was the first to codify it within the [[marketing literature]]. &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, No. 3, May-June, 1972, pp. 48-57 &lt;/ref&gt; Some marketing historians, notably Wilkie and Moore, have argued that a societal perspective was not new, and that evidence for it could be found in marketing theory and in marketing texts, since the discipline's inception in the early 1900s. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp 224-232 DOI: 10.1177/0276146706291067; Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 116–146 &lt;/ref&gt; Kotler introduced both the concept of [[social marketing]] (extending marketing technologies into non-business areas) and societal marketing, arguing that the marketing concept and its technologies must be tempered and ultimately revised by adopting a more explicit social orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' 2002,  Vol 36, No. 5/6, pp 48-569&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of Kotler's concept was the idea of "long-run consumer welfare", emphasizing that the short-term desires might not support the consumer's long term interests or be good for the society as a whole.

The societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Instead, marketing activities should strive to benefit society's overall well-being. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including: employees, customers, local communities, the wider public and government and consider the impact of their activities on all stakeholders. They ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society. Societal marketing developed into [[sustainable marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P and Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing,'' 9th ed., Prentice Hall, 2000; Griffin, R.W.  and Ebert, E.J., ''Business '' 5th edition, Prentice Hall, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing requires businesses to include social, ethical and ecological considerations in product and market planning. &lt;ref&gt;Abratt, Russell and Sacks, Diane, "Perceptions of the Societal Marketing Concept", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 23, No. 6, 1989, pp. 25–33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
Kotler identified four categories of products, classified in terms of long term benefits and immediate satisfaction: &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, May-June, pp. 54-56&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg|thumb|Cigarettes are typically classified as a '' pleasing products'' since they deliver immediate benefits with long-term social harm]]
#Deficient products, which bring neither long-run or short term benefits
#Pleasing products, which bring a high level of immediate [[Customer satisfaction|satisfaction]], but can cause harm to the society in the long run
#Salutary products, which bring low short term satisfaction, but benefit the society on the long run
#Desirable products, which combine long-run benefit and immediate satisfaction

Kotler's concept of societal marketing suggested that for the well-being of society, deficient products should be eliminated from the market, pleasing and salutary products should go through a product modification process to acquire desirable status, by incorporating missing short term benefits into salutary products and long term benefits into pleasing products, and the companies' ultimate goal should be to develop desirable products. Rather than focusing on selling a products, which can be good or bad for the consumers,  companies should focus on consumer and society's well-being.

==Examples==
Most companies recognize that socially responsible activities improve their image among customers, [[stockholders]], the [[financial community]], and other relevant publics. Ethical and socially responsible practices are simply good business, resulting not only in favorable image, but ultimately in increased sales.

*[[The Body Shop]]: The Body Shop International plc is the original, natural and ethical beauty brand. The company uses only plant based materials for its products. It is against [[Animal testing]], supports community trade, activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights, and overall protection of the planet. They have also their own charity, The Body Shop Foundation, to assist those working to achieve progress in the areas of human and civil rights, environmental and animal protection. Thus Body shop is really following the concept of Societal Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;The Body Shop, www.thebodyshop.com/_en/_ww/services/aboutus_company.aspx)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Avon Products|AVON]] Product inc. has started an initiative known as Avon [[breast cancer]] awareness crusade in 1993 in partnership with National Alliance of breast cancer Foundation (NABCO).They started selling pink ribbon pins which depicts the international symbol for breast cancer for$2 and donates $1 to NABCO. Through the crusade Avon sale representatives have raised billion of dollars for breast cancer education and access to early detection services for underserved woman. In addition, Avon's 45,000 US sales people have been trained to discuss breast cancer and importance of early detection with their customers and distributed 80 million flyers on breast cancer detection.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal marketing v social marketing==
Societal marketing should not be confused with [[social marketing]]. Societal marketing is a philosophy or mindset that informs marketing decisions whereas social marketing is a distinct branch within the marketing discipline. Societal marketing is concerned with the consideration of the social and ethical aspects of marketing planning. Social marketing is concerned with facilitating social change. A key difference is that the greater 'social good' is the ''principal'' consideration in social marketing while social benefits are one of a number of considerations in societal marketing.  

On the other hand, social marketing is a sub-branch of marketing that began in 1971, with the publication of an article by Kotler and Zaltman, emphasising a planned approach to achieving social change. It is primarily concerned with encouraging pro-social behaviours (e.g. recycling, sun-safety, safe driving practices) and discouraging anti-social behaviours (e.g. littering, drink-driving). &lt;ref&gt;Kotler P and Zaltman G., "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change,"  ''Journal of Marketing, Vol. 35. No. 3, 1971, pp 3-12&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as an "adaptation of commercial marketing technologies to programs designed to influence the voluntary behavior of target audiences to improve their personal welfare and that of the society of which they are a part".&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, A., ''Marketing Social Change: Changing Behavior to Promote Health, Social Development and the Environment,'' San Francisco: Jossey Bass, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social marketing uses more traditional commercial techniques and strategies, focusing on persuasion, to achieve goals for the greater social good. Its [[Advertising campaign|campaigns]] can either encourage [[merit good]]s, as for example fund raising for not-for-profit organizations or dissuade the use of [[demerit good]]s promoting society's well being, as non-smoking campaigns or promote the use of seat belts. Another characteristic of social marketing is that is planned to influence individual behaviour to improve well-being. It includes more than just [[advertising]] in traditional mass media, and may extend to educational programs and formal enforcement regimes in the case of road safety campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It planned campaigns, implemented by governmental and non-governmental organisations. A clear example that differentiates societal from social marketing is a marketing campaign on non-smoking. A smoking cessation advertisement is an example of social marketing, but if the marketing strategies and techniques used in that campaign focus on increasing the well-being of society, that same campaign can be an example of societal marketing.

The societal marketing concept was a forerunner of sustainable marketing in integrating issues of social responsibility into commercial [[marketing strategies]]. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to influence social change. Social marketing applies a "customer orientated" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like Anti-Smoking-Campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

== Corporate social responsibility (CSR)==
Unlike societal marketing, CSR has existed for many years. Another difference is that CSR "focuses more in a [[corporate]] level and stakeholders", &lt;ref&gt; Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while societal marketing is more concerned about the consumer and their long term benefits. CSR social and environmental concerns are integrated into all business operations. CSR is mainly run by companies, while social marketing mainly by Government or Non profits organizations. One example of CSR among companies is what [[Häagen-Dazs]] is doing with their "microsite" to raise awareness to the general public about the preservation of the honeybee.

==Branding==
Corporations are the one who are striving during the whole time for improvements. They are turning to all kind of forms of [[corporate societal marketing]] programs to help build and repair their brand images.

Corporate Social Marketing, or CSM, usually refers to marketing efforts that have at least one social related objective, such as charity founding, among its goals. Typical examples are releasing a certain percentage of the final sale product to a charity related to the product, or sponsoring events that encourage social well-being such as the Olympic Games. Corporate Social Marketing benefits a company in many ways, but its main goal is to improve the image the public has of the company. A company that appears committed to improving the lives or others, the environment or other worthy causes is seen in a better light than one who doesn't, and more and more business are hoping to benefit from that.

So, it can be so, that CSM programs are becoming extremely popular because the leaders believe that it is a good business to be viewed as a socially responsible company.&lt;ref&gt;Business in the Community, "Businesses Use Marketing Muscle to Tackle Social Issues", in ''Cause-related Marketing Website,''&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though past research suggests that CSM may be effective in improving [[brand equity]] and increasing market share, there are limits to the effectiveness of these initiatives.

An example of his is how corporate social initiatives adversely affected purchase intentions if consumers perceived that the company would forgo product quality in order to be socially responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sankar and Bhattacharya, C.B., "Does Doing Good Always Lead to Doing better, Consumer Reactions to Corporate Societal Responsibility," ''Journal of Marketing Research,'' Vol 38, May, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the nature of the CSM program, the intent of the corporation may not be as obvious to the consumers. This happens if the benefits to the corporation are not apparent or conflicts with what the consumer already believes about a specific firm or industry.

Since firms exist to make a profit, consumers may spend considerable energy in an attempt to infer motives related to the profit-oriented goals. As an example, a consumer may be suspicious of a tobacco company that undertakes a campaign to prevent underage smoking. If this is successful, the company would be affected and the cigarette sales will be lowered. So, in this situation, consumers' suspicions may lead them to infer motives that would actually protect the companies financial condition – as they are trying to improve their image to sell more cigarettes to adults. However, if a tobacco company undertook a CSM Campaign, that would sustain their business consumers may be able to infer profit motives more easily and then have a more favorable attitude toward the partnership. Therefore, it can be concluded that the attitude of the consumers could be better if they knew more about the motives of the companies and they were more obvious.

Another aspect that may cause suspicion with consumers is the amount of harm that a company has already done, either because of unsafe products or harmful production practices. It is logical that consumers are more suspicious to companies that sell harmful products. Again examples are the tobacco companies and alcohol companies as well. They will meet resistance from consumers when they undertake socially-oriented campaigns aimed at mitigating the effects of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeffler, Steve and Keller, Kevin Lane, "Building Brand Equity through Corporate Societal Marketing", ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 21, No. 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; That is why when different industries are separated, two very general dimensions are used – the harmful nature of the products and the harmful nature of the production methods.

This classification can briefly show how consumer are influenced by the various CSM efforts. Companies that work in this "dangerous" industries are not that successful always, because the consumers may be suspicious of any societal efforts the company attempts to undertake. Consumers will infer less society-serving motives and more self-serving motives for corporate societal marketing programs undertaken by firms that operate in mixed or sin industries.

Based on how easily consumers could infer profit-driven motives, are classified the types of CSM campaigns: Positively tied to product sales, positively tied to product sales, not directly tied to sales but aimed at sustaining the company's business, completely unrelated.

==Criticisms==
Societal marketing has been the subject of a number of criticisms: 

A key issue concerns the question of who decides what is in the public’s best interests. The moral agenda implicit in the societal marketing concept is underdeveloped and often implicit. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; Gaski argued that marketers should step away from their classic goal of [[customer satisfaction]] and [[profit maximization]] while respecting the minimum governmental standards imposed by law and enter this [[public policy]] area, since marketers themselves would have to decide what actions are consistent with public welfare. Marketers might have neither the competence nor the right to determine the "public interest." Instead, it should be the customers who decide what is good for them, or their political representatives and dictate that to the industry. &lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, 1985, 42-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have argued that societal marketing is not a distinct concept, but rather it is a mere extension of the marketing concept. Others have pointed out that the literature in the field is vague, poorly defined and underdeveloped. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; The societal marketing concept has become an excellent strategy for promotions with social dimensions and for exploring consumers' behavioural response to such corporate 'doing good'.

; Future development of the concept:
Societal marketing is gaining the marketers and consumer attention  and there is every reason to expect it to continue to evolve in practice. It focuses on providing win-win opportunities to companies, consumers and society. But achieving the compelling benefits for each party involved is very complicated. So much more research is needed. To achieve a win situation for organization involved, is dependent largely upon how the key constituents react. In this context, anticipating consumer reaction is really challenging which can be affected by number of factors that often vary across different segments. The several research questions remain to be answered like how different factors affects reaction to societal marketing and how do the various factors interact? How can societal initiatives be designed to leverage positive reaction and mitigate negative ones? &lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

For consumers to win, societal marketing must provide them with compelling benefits that increase their overall welfare. What benefits did societal marketing initiative actually provided to consumers? Are there direct benefits such as increased satisfaction with their interaction with commercial or nonprofit organization?
Determining whether there is a win situation for society by societal marketing initiative is the most difficult question to be answered. We turn to the two questions proposed by Bloom, Hussien and Szykmann (1995):  Is the society better off because of this program? Does corporate involvement result in better performance than if it would have been managed by NGOs or government agencies? 
Societal marketing is becoming globally popular but there exist a scarcity of research in this field. Therefore extensive future research is needed particularly investigating questions with respect to its impact on consumer attitudes to corporate image, product image and their purchase intention or brand choice as well as on positive impact on society.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tellus Institute''' is a non-profit research and policy organization based in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Its mission is to advance the transition to a sustainable, equitable, and humane global civilization. The Tellus Institute was founded in 1976 by [[Paul Raskin]], Richard Rosen, Stephen Bernow, John Stutz, and David Nichols for the purpose of research on resource and environmental strategies. Dr. Paul Raskin is the President of the Institute. Initially called  the Energy Systems Research Group (ESRG), the Institute adopted its current name in 1990.

==History==
Since 1976, Tellus has conducted over 3,500 resource management and environmental strategy projects throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tellus.org/ | title=Our vision, our work | last= | first= | date= | website=Tellus Institute | accessdate=27 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is well known in the environmental strategies domain for its many studies on state and municipality recycling programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic &amp; Environmental Benefits of Beverage Container Recycling: The Case for Updating Massachusetts’ Bottle Bill|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/assets/pdfs/campaigns/massachusetts/1998-EconEnviroBenefits.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison of System Costs and Materials Recovery Rates: Implementation of Universal Single Stream Recycling With and Without Beverage Container Deposits - Draft Report|url=http://www.anr.state.vt.us/dec/wastediv/solid/documents/DRAFT-ReportToANR-4MAR2013.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Bottle Bill - A Final Report to: Michigan Great Lakes Protection Fund|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/deq-whm-BottleBillRpt-Tellus_255247_7.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including its 1992 Packaging study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/01/00047/7-10.htm | title=Tellus Packaging Study | last= | first= | date= | website=Pollution Prevention Infohouse | accessdate=27 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2008 Assessment of Options for Massachusetts' Solid Waste Master Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessment of Materials Management Options for the MA Solid Waste Master Plan Review|url=http://www.tellus.org/pub/Final_Report-Materials_Management_Options_for_MA_SW_Master_Plan_Review_-_With_Appendices_-_12-08.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Preliminary Analysis of the Costs and Benefits of Bottle Bills study done for the US EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is a National Bottle Bill Worthwhile?|url=http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=18077|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years Tellus has created numerous scientific tools and reports in many different areas, including energy, water, [[sustainable communities]], [[corporate social responsibility]], and climate change; however, since 2005 the Institute has shifted its focus to developing a [[Great Transition]] vision for a sustainable future.

==Research and programs==
The main body of Tellus' current research specializes in the application of quantitative analysis to the development of possible future scenarios.

Tellus has also launched a number of subsidiary working groups and research programs:

*'''The [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG)''' was convened in 1995 in order to compile a set of possible scenarios for global development in the twenty-first century. Its goal was to identify a sustainable and equitable future within this set of scenarios and to isolate the policies, actions, and human choices required to achieve this scenario. Its findings indicated that an environmentally sustainable, socially equitable future —which the GSG termed a "Great Transition"—was possible. The GSG’s work culminated with the 2002 publication of ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay | title=GT Essay | last= | first= | date= | website=Great Transition Initiative | accessdate=27 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Raskin led the GSG, which consisted of more than 20 environmental scholars from throughout the globe. Scenarios developed by the GSG have informed the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]’s Global Environment Outlook series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Environment Outlook Scenario Framework: Background Paper for UNEP's Third Global Environment Outlook Report|url=http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO3/pdfs/GEO_ScenarioFramework.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other international and national vision studies.
*'''The [[Great Transition#Great Transition Initiative|Great Transition Initiative]] (GTI)''' was formed in 2003 to re-channel the momentum of the GSG. Its mandate is to continue scenario development, disseminate the Great Transition vision to a larger audience, and build a network of GTI members. It was relaunched in April 2014 as an online journal and discussion network devoted to vision and praxis around a progressive global transformation.
*'''Corporation 20/20''' is an initiative of Tellus focused on [[corporate social responsibility]]. Its mission is to develop and advocate the redesign of corporations so that business is guided by social purpose as well as financial gain. Co-founded in 2004 by Allen White, Vice President of Tellus, and Marjorie Kelly, co-founder and former editor of ''Business Ethics'' magazine, Corporation 20/20 hosts a forum of leading thinkers, practitioners, and advocates who work to construct alternate visions of the corporate structure, which it then disseminates into the corporate community.
*'''The [[Global Reporting Initiative]]''', founded by [[Ceres (organization)]] and Tellus Vice President Allen White, had the goal of developing and disseminating a standardized framework for sustainability reporting. Now an autonomous organization based in Amsterdam, the GRI's framework has become the de facto international standard used by over 1,200 companies for corporate reporting on environmental, social and economic performance.
*'''The Global Initiative for Sustainability Ratings (GISR)''' is an initiative launched by Ceres and Tellus in 2011 whose goal is to develop an independent, standardized framework for sustainability ratings.
*'''Boston Scenario Project''' was initiated in 2005 as a process for developing local scenarios for the Boston metropolitan region that mirror the global-scale scenarios described in the Great Transition essay. The project seeks to reconcile worldwide effects with local actions in order to envision a future of sustainability, pluralism, justice, and global responsibility for the Boston region, which would also contribute to worldwide sustainability and equity. The Boston Scenario Project is coordinated by James Goldstein, Tellus Senior Fellow.

==Tools==
Tellus developed and uses a series of software programs in its research. These programs were designed for strategic planning and [[scenario analysis]], allowing the user to create, evaluate, and compare alternative futures based on current data and hypothetical trends. Long range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) System software facilitates energy-environment planning; [[Weap|WEAP]], water planning; WastePlan, solid waste planning; and PoleStar, sustainability planning.

The phrase "'''violence begets violence'''" (or "hate begets hate") means that violent behavior promotes other violent behavior, in return. The phrase has been used since at least the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11184923/violence_begets_violence_1834/|title="Violence begets violence" (1834)|date=1834-11-04|work=The Times|access-date=2017-05-23|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence begets violence is a concept described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], verse 26:52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/matthew-26-52.html|title=Matthew 26:52 Commentary - John Gill's Exposition of the Bible|website=Bible Study Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/26.html|title=Matthew Henry Commentary on the Whole Bible (Complete) |website=www.biblestudytools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/commentaries/matthew/26-52.htm|title=Matthew 26:52 Commentaries: Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.|website=biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage depicts a [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] (identified in the [[Gospel of John]] as [[Saint Peter]]) drawing a sword to defend against the [[arrest of Jesus]] but being told to sheath his weapon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 26:52, New International Version.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness. We must meet the forces of hate with the power of love... Our aim must never be to defeat or humiliate the white man, but to win his friendship and understanding.&lt;ref name=MLKq/&gt;}}

{{quote|The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy, instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you may murder the hater,  but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate.

Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.&lt;ref name=MLK4&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Luther King Jr.|title= Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?|year=1967|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''voluntary group''' or '''union''' (also sometimes called a '''voluntary organization''', '''common-interest association''',&lt;ref name=Prins2010&gt;Prins HEL et al. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yP6TrXRpPdMC Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge]. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|266}} '''association''', or '''society''') is a group of individuals who enter into an agreement, usually as [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, to form a body (or [[organization]]) to accomplish a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/association association] Entry at [[Dictionary.reference.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples include [[trade association]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[learned society|learned societies]], [[professional association]]s, and [[Environmental movement|environmental group]]s.

Membership is not necessarily voluntary: in order for particular associations to function correctly they might need to be mandatory or at least strongly encouraged, as is common with many [[teachers union]]s in the US. Because of this, some people use the term common-interest association to describe groups which form out of a common interest, although this term is not widely used or understood.&lt;ref name=Prins2010/&gt;

Voluntary associations may be incorporated or unincorporated; for example, in the US, unions gained additional powers by incorporating.&lt;ref&gt;Bradburn B. (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IbqTcM4rrR8C&amp;pg=PA217#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Citizenship Revolution: Politics and the Creation of the American Union, 1774–1804]'', p. 217. [[University of Virginia Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the terms Voluntary Association or Voluntary Organisation cover every type of group from a small local Residents' Association to large Associations (often  [[Registered charity|Registered Charities]]) with multimillion-[[British pound|pound]] turnover that run large-scale business operations (often providing some kind of [[public service]] as subcontractors to government departments or local authorities).

==Differences by jurisdictions==
In many [[jurisdiction]]s no formalities are necessary to start an association. In some jurisdictions, there is a minimum for the number of persons starting an association.

Some jurisdictions require that the association register with the police or other official body to inform the public of the association's existence. This could be a tool of political control or intimidation, and also a way of protecting the economy from [[fraud]].

In many such jurisdictions, only a registered association (or in the UK an incorporated body) is a [[juristic person]] whose members are not responsible for the financial acts of the association. Any group of persons may, of course, work as an informal association, but in such cases, each person making a transaction in the name of the association takes responsibility for that transaction, just as if it were that individual's personal transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 2|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many countries where the formation of truly independent Voluntary Associations is effectively proscribed by law or where they are theoretically legally permitted, but in practice are persecuted; for example, where membership brings unwelcome attention from police or other state agencies.

==History==
[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
Voluntary groups are a broad and original form of nonprofit organizations, and have existed since ancient history. In [[Ancient Greece]], for example, there were various organizations ranging from elite clubs of wealthy men (''hetaireiai'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4436529 Politics on the Margins: The Athenian "Hetaireiai" in 415 BC]. ''Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte''.&lt;/ref&gt; to private religious or professional associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ascough, Richard S.

In Community Formation in the Early Church and the Church Today. Edited by Richard N. Longenecker, 3–24. Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In preindustrial societies, governmental administrative duties were often handled by voluntary associations such as [[guild]]s. In medieval Europe, guilds often controlled towns.&lt;ref name=Kohn2003&gt;Kohn M. (2003). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=427763 Merchant Associations in Pre-Industrial Europe].

==Legal status==
A standard definition of an unincorporated association was given by [[Frederick Lawton (judge)|Lord Justice Lawton]] in the [[English trust law]] case ''[[Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell]]'' (1981):&lt;ref&gt;[1981] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1981/2.html EWCA Civ 2], [1982] 1 WLR 522&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"unincorporated association" [means] two or more persons bound together for one or more common purposes, not being business purposes, by mutual undertakings, each having mutual duties and obligations, in an organisation which has rules which identify in whom control of it and its funds rests and upon what terms and which can be joined or left at will.&lt;ref&gt;The definition was for [[taxation|tax]] purposes, but was expressed to be of general application.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In most countries, an unincorporated association does not have [[legal person|separate legal personality]], and few members of the association usually enjoy [[limited liability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=XU, Y.  |author2=Ngai, N. P.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China. Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly. 40(2), 247–269 |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |url= http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/07/23/0899764009340229.abstract |publisher=Nvs.sagepub.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some countries they are treated as having separate [[legal personality]] for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom an unincorporated association is assessable to [[corporation tax]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of their lack of legal personality, [[Will (law)|legacies]] to unincorporated associations are sometimes subject to general common law prohibitions against [[Purpose trust#Unincorporated associations|purpose trusts]].

Associations that are organized for profit or financial gain are usually called [[partnership]]s.&lt;ref&gt;In most [[common law]] legal systems, partnership is defined by statute as "the relationship which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit"&lt;/ref&gt; A special kind of partnership is a [[co-operative]] which is usually founded on one person&amp;mdash;one vote principle and distributes its profits according to the amount of goods produced or bought by the members. Associations may take the form of a [[non-profit organization]] or they may be [[not-for-profit corporation]]s; this does not mean that the association cannot make benefits from its activity, but all the benefits must be reinvested. Most associations have some kind of document or documents that regulate the way in which the body meets and operates. Such an instrument is often called the organization's bylaws, constitution, regulations, or agreement of association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 85|edition = 2nd|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[English law]], an unincorporated association consists of two or more members bound by the rules of a society which has at some point in time, been founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettit |first=Philip |year=2009 |title=Equity and the Law of Trusts|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19956102-5  |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theories have been proposed as to the way that such associations hold rights. A transfer may be considered to have been made to the association's members directly as [[joint tenants]] or [[tenants in common]]. Alternatively, the funds transferred may be considered to have been under the terms of a private [[purpose trusts in English law|purpose trust]]. Many purpose trusts fail for want of a [[beneficiary]] and this may therefore may result in the gift failing. However, some purpose trusts are valid, and, accordingly, some cases have decided that the rights associated with unincorporated associations are held on this basis. The dominant theory, however, is that the rights are transferred to the members or officers absolutely, perhaps on trust for the members, but are importantly bound by contracts ''[[inter se]]''.&lt;ref name="pettit6265"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettit |first=Philip |year=2009 |title=Equity and the Law of Trusts|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19956102-5  |pages=62–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, on dissolution, the distribution of these rights depends on how they were held. A purpose trust may by its nature survive the dissolution of the association, or it may not. If it fails as a result of the dissolution, then the rights will be held on [[resulting trusts in English law|resulting trust]] for the contributors, unless they can be shown to have renounced their right to such a trust in their favour. If the rights are held subject to contract, then they will be divided among the surviving membership upon dissolution, according to the terms of the contracts ''inter se'' or an implied term according to contribution. If, as a result of this contract or statute, no member can claim, the rights will pass to the Crown as ''[[bona vacantia]]''. This conclusion has also been suggested where the association dissolves because only one member remains, although this has been doubted by some commentators who believe the last members should be entitled to the rights.&lt;ref name="pettit6265"/&gt;

===Scotland===
[[Scottish law]] on unincorporated associations is essentially the same as English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/download_file/view/357/ |title=Report on Unincorporated Associations |publisher=Scottish Law Commission |id=SCOT LAW COM No 217 |date=November 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014 |quote=We are not aware of any material differences between the law of Scotland and the law of England and Wales regarding unincorporated associations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Each state sets its own laws as to what constitutes an unincorporated association and how it is to be treated under the laws. In the United States, voluntary associations which were incorporated were "pre-eminent" in collective action.&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Companies: Organizational Aspects of Religion and Religious Aspects of Organizations, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5OBplT1ehtgC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p108]. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[California]], during the 1980s, then [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] [[Los Angeles County District Attorney|district attorney]] [[Ira Reiner]] decided to use California's unincorporated associations law to attack [[street gangs]] and the habit of their members of tagging [[graffiti]] in public spaces, in an attempt to abate vandalism and to recover cleanup costs. He sued the street gangs by name, with cases titled such as ''City of Los Angeles v. [[Bloods|The Bloods]]'' and ''City of Los Angeles v. [[Crips|The Crips]]'', which then allowed the city to go after any member of the street gang, as a member of the unincorporated association being sued, for damages resulting from graffiti tagging involving that gang's name{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.
* In [[Texas]], state law has statutes concerning unincorporated non-profit associations that allow unincorporated associations that meet certain criteria to operate as entities independent of their members, with the right to own property, make contracts, sue and be sued, with limited liability for their officers and members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonprofit Organizations|url=http://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/nonprofit_org.shtml|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York (state)|New York]] state law regarding unincorporated associations actually gives members of the association more protection against liability than that given to either stockholders of [[corporation]]s or members of [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]]. This was noted in the case{{which|date=April 2013}} of the [[Associated Press]] organization, because the members of the AP are not liable for damages for the organization's actions unless the association as a whole approved it.

===Australia===
In most Australian states and territories, a similar set of laws allows not-for-profit associations to become legal entities with a limit to the liability of their members. An example of such a law, the Associations Incorporation Act that is in force in South Australia, allows for the creation of a legal entity able to buy and sell land and in general, enter into legally binding contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associations Incorporation Act 1985|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/ASSOCIATIONS%20INCORPORATION%20ACT%201985.aspx|publisher=Government of South Australia, Attorney-General's Department|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many clubs and societies begin life as an unincorporated body and seek to attain incorporated status to protect its members from legal liability and in many cases to seek government financial assistance only available to an incorporated body. Clubs and societies wishing to incorporate must meet the provisions of the relevant state act and lodge their constitution with the corresponding state government authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to incorporate|url=http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/Associations/how/index.html|publisher=The Government of South Australia, Consumer &amp; Business Services|accessdate=17 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924075924/http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/Associations/how/index.html|archive-date=24 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
Certain [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] systems classify an '''association''' as a special form of [[contract]]ual relationship.

===Canada===
Under the [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec Civil Code]] an association is categorized as a type of statutory specific contract set forth in a constitution. An association can become incorporated with its own legal identity so that it may, e.g., open a bank account, enter into contracts (rent real estate, hire employees, take out an insurance policy), or sue or be sued.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===France===
In [[France]], all voluntary associations are non-profit. They may count as unincorporated (''association non-déclarée'') or incorporated (''association déclarée''), and are created in terms of and governed by the [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau|Waldeck-Rousseau]] Act 1901. This is why ''[[:fr:Association loi 1901|association loi (de) 1901]]'' is subjoined to their name, except in [[Alsace]]-[[Moselle]] area which is governed by local law in this regard (the area was German in 1901) and are therefore called ''[[:fr:Association loi 1908|association loi (de) 1908]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}. If the association responding to defined criteria, like social or medical help for example, they can be declared "public utility association" (''association d'utilité publique'') by French authorities. Associations act 1901 let an important large of freedom about internal operation, like direction or authorized members for example.

===Germany===
{{Main article|Eingetragener Verein}}
The [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] sets out different rights and rules for an unincorporated association (''nicht eingetragener Verein'') with legal identity (''Vereine'', art. 21-79 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]) versus an incorporated association (''eingetragener Verein'') with full [[legal person]]ality, which the law treats as partnerships (''Gesellschaften'', art. 705-740 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]). Associations can be for-profit (''wirtschaftlicher Verein''), non-for-profit (''Idealverein''), or public (''gemeinnütziger Verein'').{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], many non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are established as registered  nonprofit associations (Hebrew ''amutah,'' plural ''amutot'') (some are established as public benefit companies (Hebrew ''Chevrah LeTo’elet Hatzibur'') not to be confused with [[public benefit corporation]]s). ‘‘Amutot’’ are regulated by the Associations Law, 1980. An ''amutah'' is a body corporate, though not a company. The ''amutah'' is successor to the Ottoman Society which predated the State of Israel, and was established by the now-superseded Ottoman Societies Law of 1909, based on the French law of 1901. An ''amutah'' must register with the ''Rasham Ha’amutot'' ('Registrar of Amutot'), under the purview of the ''Rashot Hata’agidim'' ('Corporations Authority') of the [[Ministry_of_Justice_(Israel)|Ministry of Justice]].

==Freedom of association==
The freedom of association stands in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml|publisher=The United Nations|accessdate= September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Cquote|Article 20
:(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
:(2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.}}

[[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] also protects the right to [[freedom of assembly]] and association.

{{Cquote|Article 11 – Freedom of assembly and association

# Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.
# No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.}}

A '''''Vorlage''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfoːɐ̯laːɡə|}}; from the [[German language|German]] for ''prototype'' or ''template'') is a prior version or manifestation of a text under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online: vorlage, n.
Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. &lt;[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679 http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679]&gt;; accessed 14 January 2012. First published in A Supplement to the OED IV, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular [[manuscript]] of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts).&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Jonathan D. H., ''Contours in the Text'' (T&amp;T Clark International, 2011), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a [[translation]] is called the ''Vorlage'' of that translation.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman &amp; Kuhlken, ''What are the Dead Sea scrolls and why do they matter?'' (Eerdmans, 2007), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Luther Bible]] is a translation of the [[Textus Receptus]]. So in this case the Textus Receptus is the ''Vorlage'' of the Luther Bible.  

Sometimes the ''Vorlage'' of a translation may be lost to history.  In some of these cases the ''Vorlage'' may be reconstructed from the translation.  Such a reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may be called a ''retroversion'', and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty.  Nevertheless, the ''Vorlage'' may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of [[textual criticism]].  This reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses.  Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed ''Vorlage'' of the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] at parts to correct the Hebrew [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer.&lt;ref&gt;Albrektson, B., "Masoretic or Mixed" in ''Text, Translation, Theology'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as another example, the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] fragments of Plato's [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] included among the [[Nag Hammadi library]] are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Slings, S. R., ''Platonis Rempublicam'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the bulk of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the ''Vorlage'' exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.&lt;ref&gt;Plisch, Uwe-Karsten ''Das Thomasevangelium, Originaltext mit Kommentar''. (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alliantiewapen Nassau Loon-Heinsberg - Alliance coat of arms of Nassau Loon-Heinsberg - Wapenboek Nassau-Vianden - KB 1900 A 016, folium 20r.jpg|thumb|Alliance arms of [[Maria of Loon-Heinsberg]]. Arms of women were usually depicted on lozenges. Here, her family arms are impaled with those of her husband, [[Jan IV of Nassau]]. ]]

Due to the differing role of women in past society, special rules grew relating to the [[blazon]]ing of arms for women. The rules for women and heraldry developed differently from place to place and there is no one single rule that applies everywhere. In general, arms of women were most likely depicted not on shields but on [[Lozenge_(heraldry)|lonzeges]] or ovals. Different rules exist that depend on the woman's marital status and a married woman would also often make use of her husband's arms in addition to those from her family. In both the English&lt;ref name="ukcollege1"/&gt; and the Scottish&lt;ref name="hersocscot"/&gt; systems of heraldry these differences remain active.

==Characteristics==
===Escutcheons, crests, and other heraldic elements===
Heraldry has its origins from associations with warfare and the age of chivalry. The traditional shield was also associated with war and so women did not usually display familial arms on [[Escutcheon_(heraldry)|escutcheons]]. Rather, they could display these on various other shapes: more commonly the [[Lozenge_(heraldry)|lozenge]], an oval, or a [[Cartouche_(design)|cartouche]].

The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]]–a device that sits atop the shield on an [[armorial achievement]]–likewise was not accorded to heraldic devices of women as these had associations with warfare.

===Transmission===
In many heraldic traditions, arms generally are passed patrilineally. In other nations, in Canadian heraldry for example,  women may inherit arms on an equal basis with their brothers (if any). Women in Canada may also transmit their arms to their heirs, regardless of gender.{{refn|This system of equality for men and women is a result of provisions in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantee, among other things, freedom from discrimination under the law on the basis of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterofrights.ca/en/17_00_01 |title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – Equality Rights |publisher=6074332 Canada Inc., in association with SailorJones Media Inc. |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When unmarried, she displays her arms on a [[lozenge]] (a diamond shape) or on an oval or oval-like shape. Traditionally, a woman does not display her arms on a shield, as the shield originated with [[knights]] and warfare, and is thus viewed as fitting for a man, but not a woman.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A married woman may also bear either her own arms or her husband's arms alone on a shield with the shield charged with a small lozenge to distinguish her from her husband.&lt;ref name="Slater"&gt;{{cite book|author=Slater,  Stephen|title=The  Complete  Book  of  Heraldry|year=2004|publisher=Anness  Pub.

A widowed woman usually displays the impaled arms on a lozenge-shaped shield, unless she is a heraldic heiress (see below).&lt;ref name="Fearn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fearn, Jacqueline|title=Discovering Heraldry|year=1980|publisher=Shire|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heraldic Heiresses====
If the woman is an [[heraldic heiress]], her arms are shown on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon of pretence]], which is a small shield in the centre of her husband's arms. When widowed, instead of showing the impaled arms on a lozenge, she continues to use her marital arms, but placed on a lozenge or oval.&lt;ref name="Fearn"/&gt; In England and Northern Ireland, if there is more than one surviving daughter, each transmits her father's arms on equal terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFriar1993|Friar 1993]], p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland however, only the eldest surviving daughter transmits her father's undifferenced arms to her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBurnett1997|Burnett 1997]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian Heraldry===
{{main|Canadian heraldry}}
 
In [[Canadian heraldry]], women and men are treated equally for heraldic purpose, reflecting Canadian equality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterofrights.ca/en/17_00_01 |title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - Equality Rights |publisher=6074332 Canada Inc., in association with SailorJones Media Inc. |date= |accessdate= June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore common to display the arms of women on shields, rather than on a lozenge or oval, but a woman may still choose to have her arms displayed on a traditional shape.

In many systems of heraldry, the arms of each living person must be unique. English heraldry has used armorial variants to distinguish the arms of brothers from their father's arms and from each other since the thirteenth century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Boutell |title=The handbook to English heraldry |others=[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], ed |year=1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xdMAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Boutell%20Fox%20Davies&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Chapter XII}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is now normally done by the system of marks or ''brisures'' set up by the early Tudor herald [[John Writhe]].&lt;ref name="ukcollege1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/12.htm|title=The Law of Arms: The descent of arms|date=2004-04-10|publisher=College of Arms|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada adds a unique series of brisures for use by female children who inherit arms. As in other heraldic systems, these cadency marks are not always used;&lt;ref name="Royal Heraldry Society of Canada-Cadency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.heraldry.ca/course_canadian.htm|publisher=Royal Heraldry Society of Canada|title=Heraldry Examination|accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in any case, when the heir succeeds (in Canada, the first child, whether male or female, according to strict [[primogeniture]]), the mark of cadency is removed and the heir uses the plain coat of arms.&lt;ref name="hersocscot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html |title=Beginners Heraldry, The Heraldry Society of Scotland – UK Heraldry |publisher=The Heraldry Society of Scotland |date=2005-04-17 |accessdate=2008-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013201010/http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at a global level, most of them work in agriculture (70%).&lt;ref name=WHO_Childlab/&gt; Approximately 2.4 million [[adolescents]] aged 16 to 17 years worked in the U.S. in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics [2007].

==Work that poses special risks for young workers==
[[File:Teen Workers - Real Jobs, Real Risks (Mallory's Story) (2009).webm|thumb|A young worker describing a severe occupational injury]]
Because of their biologic, social, and economic characteristics, young workers have unique and substantial risks for work-related injuries and illnesses. Besides retail and agriculture, other areas of high risk for work-related injuries include construction and work activities involving motor vehicles and mobile machinery. Although safety requirements and [[child labor laws]] prohibit or restrict teen employment in certain kinds of industries and occupations, young workers may yet face risks on the job because an employer or a young employee may not be aware of applicable laws and may not be aware that a hazard exists, because the young employee may lack experience, or because there is inadequate training or supervision.

[[Child labor]] is the employment of children under an age determined by law or custom. This practice is considered exploitative by many countries and international organizations. Child labor was utilized to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the beginning of [[public education|universal schooling]], with changes in working conditions during [[industrialization]], and with the emergence of the concepts of [[worker's rights|workers']] and [[children's rights]]. Child labor is still common in some places. Even after passing child labor legislation, developing countries in particular still feature informal economies made up of child workers who are more exposed to human rights violations in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Furlong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in agriculture===
There are roughly 250,000 children who work on U.S. farms, that do not live on the farm, and another 30 million children who visit farms annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agrinewspubs.com/Content/Default/Machinery/Article/Keep-kids-safe-on-farm-/-3/102/13392|title=Keep kids safe on farm  - AgriNews|website=www.agrinewspubs.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About every three days a child dies on a U.S. farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://southwestfarmpress.com/equipment/farm-related-childhood-deaths-are-down-still-too-many|title=Farm-related childhood deaths are down, but still too many|website=southwestfarmpress.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, most youth work fatalities occurred in the [[agriculture]] sector.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{cite journal|last = Windau|first = Janice|author2=Samuel Meyer  |title = Occupational injuries among young workers|journal = Monthly Labor Review|pages = 11–23|date=October 2005|url = http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/10/art2full.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of these [[death|fatalities]] could be attributed to [[transportation]] [[accidents]].&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; According to the "Occupational injuries among young workers" report, most of these transportation accidents occurred either by truck or by tractor. Tractor accidents alone counted for 1/4 of the youth worker fatalities from 1993 to 2002.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; For workers 13 years old and younger, agricultural fatalities accounted for 42 out of the 49 total fatalities for that age group between 1998 and 2002.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; There are fewer [[child labor]] restrictions on family-owned or operated [[farm]]s; workers as young as 13 can legally operate [[tractor]]s on farms if their family owns it or operates it.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

Experiences and exposures across different sectors of agriculture vary greatly. For example, children who worked on tobacco farms experienced a number of negative health effects including nausea, heat exhaustion, and burning eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/17/health/hrw-children-tobacco-workers-report/index.html|title=Kids working on tobacco farms experience nicotine poisoning - CNN.com|website=CNN|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in construction===
Between the years 1998 and 2002, [[construction]] accidents accounted for 18% of youth worker fatalities,&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; making construction the second most deadly industry for a young worker to be employed in during that time period. A significant number of young worker fatalities in this sector resulted from work that the young worker was not [[Legal (disambiguation)|legally]] authorized to do. For example, 16-year-old workers accounted for almost 20% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector between 1998 and 2002, even though workers 16 and younger are legally unauthorized to enter a construction site;&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; if they do work for the construction industry, they can only work in an office or sales department.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Additionally, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino]] young workers made up 35% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Hispanics make up 14.4% of the United States' general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = U.S. Census Bureau|title = Population of the United States by Race and Hispanic/Latino Origin, Census 2000 and July 1, 2005| work = National Population Estimates|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc| year = 2007|url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762156.html|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in retail trades===
The second highest number of workplace fatalities between 1993 and 1997 among workers younger than age 18 occurred in the [[retail trade]]s (e.g., [[restaurants]] and retail stores).&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt; Between 1992 and 2000, 63% of these deaths were due to [[assaults]] and violent acts, most of which were [[homicides]]. Homicide associated with [[robbery]] is the probable cause for one fourth to one half of all young worker fatalities in retail trades.&lt;ref&gt;Windau J, Sygnatur E, Toscano G [1999]. Profile of work injuries incurred by young workers. Monthly Labor Review, June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Handling cash, working alone or in small numbers, and working in the late evening and early morning hours may contribute to workplace homicides [NIOSH 1996a].&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH [1996a]. Current intelligence bulletin 57: Violence in the workplace; risk factors and prevention strategies. Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, more than half of all work-related nonfatal injuries to young workers occurred in retail trades, more than 60% of which were eating and drinking establishments. Cuts in retail trades were the most common type of injury treated in emergency departments, followed by burns in eating and drinking establishments and bruises, scrapes, and scratches in other retail settings.&lt;ref&gt;Mardis AL, Pratt SG [2003]. Nonfatal injuries to young workers in the retail trades and service industries in 1998. J Occup Environ Med 45(3):316–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Common hazards in restaurants include using knives to prepare food, handling hot grease from fryers, working near hot surfaces, and slipping on wet or greasy floors.&lt;ref&gt;NRC/IOM (National Research Council, Institute of Medicine) [1998]. Protecting youth at work: health, safety, and development of working children and adolescents in the United States. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, certain types of machinery prohibited for use by young workers under current [[child labor laws]] are commonly found in retail establishments—including food slicers, paper balers, forklifts, dough and batter mixers, and bread cutting machines. Young workers may choose to operate unfamiliar machinery to prove [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], independence, or maturity,&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health [1998]. Work-related injuries to teens. Newsletter from the teens at work: injury surveillance and prevention project. Boston, MA: Occupational Health Surveillance Program.&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be instructed to do so by an employer who is unaware of child labor laws or chooses to disregard them.

==U.S. federal and state programs==

===OSHA===
The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) within the U.S. [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] (DOL) is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for setting and enforcing standards to promote safe and healthful working conditions for all workers. Employers are responsible for becoming familiar with standards applicable to their establishments and for ensuring a safe working environment.

=== U.S. Public Health Service ===
The [[U.S. Public Health Service]] has a [[Healthy People 2010|Healthy People 2020]] objective to reduce emergency department injury rates among young workers, ages 15 through 19, to 4.9 injuries/100 full-time equivalents by 2020. The rate in 2007 was 5.3 injuries/100 full-time equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/Occupational-Safety-and-Health/objectives#5044|title=Occupational Safety and Health {{!}} Healthy People 2020|website=www.healthypeople.gov|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIOSH===
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) within the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] plays a lead role in efforts to reduce injuries and illnesses among working youth by conducting and supporting science to guide prevention efforts, disseminating findings, and working with others in collaborative outreach.

The NIOSH funds the [[National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://youth.gov/federal-links/national-childrens-center-rural-and-agricultural-health-and-safety|title=National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety {{!}} Youth.gov|website=youth.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marshfieldresearch.org/nccrahs|title=Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation - National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety|website=www.marshfieldresearch.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal child labor laws===
A workplace may be fully compliant with OSHA regulations and yet may place young workers at risk of injury or illness if applicable federal and state child labor laws are not followed. One study estimated that more than three-fourths of employers of young workers were unfamiliar with child labor laws. Lack of awareness of occupational safety and health laws by young workers, adults, and employers has been identified as a major obstacle to preventing injury and illness in young workers.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|a}} The primary Federal law governing the employment of workers under age 18 is the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) of 1938, which is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration within DOL. Child labor provisions of the FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in jobs that pose safety or health risks. The FLSA does not cover all young workers. The FLSA applies to an entire business enterprise if the enterprise has annual gross revenues of $500,000 or more. Child Labor Regulation No. 3 restricts hours and specifies allowable employment activities for workers aged 14 and 15.

===State child labor laws===

States may also have their own child labor laws that are stricter than federal laws. If a state child labor law is less protective than federal law, or if no applicable state law exists, Federal child labor laws apply.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|b}}
