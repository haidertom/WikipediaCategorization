      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4549">{{about|languages that naturally emerge in computer simulations or controlled psychological experiments with humans|planned or constructed human languages|constructed language|formal computer languages|formal language}}

'''Artificial languages''' are [[language]]s of a typically very limited size which emerge either in computer simulations between artificial agents, robot interactions or controlled psychological experiments with humans. They are different from both [[constructed language]]s and [[formal language]]s in that they have '''''not''''' been consciously devised by an individual or group but are the result of (distributed) conventionalisation processes, much like [[natural language]]s. Opposed to the idea of a central ''designer'', the field of '''artificial language evolution''' in which artificial languages are studied can be regarded as a sub-part of the more general [[cultural evolution]] studies.

==Origin==
The idea of creation of artificial language arose in 17th and 18th century as a result of gradually decreasing international role of Latin. The initial schemes ere mainly aimed at the development of a rational language free from inconsistence of living language and based on classification of concepts. The material of living languages also appears later.

== Motivation ==

The lack of empirical evidence in the field of [[evolutionary linguistics]] has led many researchers to adopt computer simulations as a means to investigate the ways in which artificial agents can self-organize languages with natural-like properties.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research is based on the hypothesis that [[natural language]] is a [[complex adaptive system]] that emerges through interactions between individuals and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of its users. By explicitly building all assumptions into computer simulations, this strand of research strives to experimentally investigate the dynamics underlying [[language change]] as well as questions regarding the [[origin of language]] under controlled conditions.

Due to its success the paradigm has also been extended to investigate the emergence of new languages in psychological experiments with humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the focus of the investigations lies on the conventionalisation dynamics and higher-level properties of the resulting languages rather than specific details of the conventions, artificially evolved languages are typically not documented or re-used outside the single experiment trial or simulation run in which they emerge. In fact, the limited size and short-lived nature of artificial languages are probably the only things that sets them apart from ''natural'' languages, since ''all'' languages are artificial insofar as they are [[conventional]] (see also [[Constructed language#Planned, constructed, artificial]]).

== Uses ==

Artificial languages have been used in research in developmental psycholinguistics. Because researchers have a great deal of control over artificial languages, they have used these languages in '''[[statistical language acquisition]]''' studies, in which it can be helpful to control the linguistic patterns heard by infants.

In [[Chinese tradition]], certain numbers are believed by some to be auspicious (吉利, {{zh|p=jílì|cy=gātleih}}) or inauspicious (不利, {{zh|p=bùlì|cy=bātleih}}) based on the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word that the number sounds similar to. 
The numbers [[6 (number)|6]], [[8 (number)|8]], and [[9 (number)|9]] are generally considered to be auspicious, while [[4 (number)|4]] and [[7 (number)|7]] are considered inauspicious.

==Zero==
The number [[0 (number)|0]] (零, {{zh|p=líng}}) is the beginning of all things and is generally considered a good number.

==One==
The number [[1 (number)|1]] (一, {{zh|p=yī|cy=yāt}}) is neither auspicious nor inauspicious. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. But it can also symbolize loneliness or being single. For example: November 11th is the [[Singles' Day]] in China, as the date has four ‘1’ which stand for singles.

==Two==
The number [[2 (number)|2]] (二 or 兩, {{zh|p=èr or liǎng}}) is most often considered a good number in Chinese culture. There is a Chinese saying: "good things come in pairs". It is common to repeat characters in product brand names, such as the character 喜 ({{zh|p=[[Shuang xi|xǐ]]|cy=héi|l=joy}}), can be repeated to form the character 囍 ({{zh|p=[[Shuang xi|shuāng xǐ]]|cy=sēung héi|l=double joy}}). 
In Cantonese, 2 (二 or 兩, {{zh|cy=yih or léuhng}}) is [[homophone]] with the characters for "easy" (易, {{zh|cy=yih}}) and "bright" (亮, {{zh|cy=leuhng}}). 
* 24 ({{zh|cy=yih sei}}) in Cantonese sounds like "easy die" (易死, {{zh|cy=yih séi}}).
* 28 ({{zh|cy=yih baat}}) in Cantonese sounds like "easy prosper" (易發, {{zh|cy=yih faat}}).

==Three==
The number [[3 (number)|3]] (三, {{zh|p=sān|cy=sāam}}) sounds like 生 ({{zh|p=shēng|cy=sāang}}), which means "to live" or "life" so it's considered a good number. It's significant since it is one of three important stages in a person’s life (birth, marriage, and death).&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, number 3 (三,{{zh|p=sān|cy=sāam}}) sounds like 散 ({{zh|p=sàn|cy=saan}}) which means "to split" or "to separate" or "to part ways" or "to break up with" so it's a bad number too.

==Four==
{{Main|Tetraphobia}}
[[File:ShanghaiMissingFloors.jpg|thumbnail|Numbers 4, 13 and 14 are omitted in some Chinese buildings.]]
The number [[4 (number)|4]] (四, {{zh|p=sì|cy=sei}}) is considered an [[unlucky number]] in [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] because it is nearly [[homophonous]] to the word "death" (死 {{zh|p=sǐ|cy=séi}}). 
Thus, some buildings in East Asia omit floors and room numbers containing 4, similar to the Western practice of some buildings not having a 13th floor because 13 is considered unlucky. 
Where East Asian and Western cultures blend, such as in [[Hong Kong]], it is possible in some buildings that the thirteenth floor along with all the floors with 4s to be omitted. Thus a building whose top floor is numbered 100 would in fact have just eighty one floors.

==Five==
The number [[5 (number)|5]] (五, {{zh|p=wǔ|cy=ńg}}) sounds like "not" in Mandarin (無, {{zh|p=wú|l=not}}) and Cantonese (唔, {{zh|cy=m̀|l=not}}). 
* 53 ({{zh|p=wǔ sān|cy=ńg sāam}}) sounds like "no life" in Mandarin (無生, {{zh|p=wú shēng|labels=no}}) and Cantonese (唔生, {{zh|cy=m̀ sāang|labels=no}}).
* 54 ({{zh|p=wǔ sì|cy=ńg sei}}) sounds like "no death" in Mandarin (無死, {{zh|p=wú sǐ|labels=no}}) and Cantonese (唔死, {{zh|cy=m̀ séi|labels=no}}).
* 58 ({{zh|p=wǔ bā|cy=ńg baat}}) sounds like "no prosperity" in Mandarin (無發, {{zh|p=wǔ fā|l=no prosperity}}) and Cantonese (唔發, {{zh|cy=m̀ faat|labels=no}}).

Five is also associated with the [[Wu Xing|five elements]] (Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, and Metal) in [[Chinese philosophy]], and in turn was historically associated with the [[Emperor of China]]. For example, the [[Tiananmen]] gate, being the main thoroughfare to the [[Forbidden City]], has five arches.

==Six==
The number [[6 (number)|6]] (六, {{zh|p=liù}}) in Mandarin sounds like "slick" or "smooth" (溜, {{zh|p=liū}}). In Cantonese, 6 ({{zh|cy=lok6}}) sounds like "good fortune" or "happiness" (祿, 樂 {{zh|cy=lok6}}).
Therefore six is considered a good number for business.

==Seven==
The number [[7 (number)|7]] (七, {{zh|p=qī}}) in Mandarin sounds like "even" in Mandarin (齊, {{zh|p=qí}}), so it is a good number for relationships. It also sounds like "arise" (起, {{zh|p=qǐ|l=}}) and "life essence" (氣, {{zh|p=qì}}) in Mandarin.
Seven can also be considered an unlucky number since the 7th month (July) is a "ghost month". It also sounds like "to deceive" (欺, {{zh|p=qī}}) in Mandarin.
In Cantonese, 7 ({{zh|cy=chāt}}) sounds like 𨳍 ({{zh|cy=chat}}), which is a vulgar way of saying "penis".

==Eight==
The number [[8 (number)|8]] (八, {{zh|p=bā|cy=baat}}) sounds like "發" ({{zh|p=fā|cy=faat|l=to prosper}}).
There is also a visual resemblance between 88 and 囍 ({{zh|p=[[Shuang xi|shuāng xǐ]]|cy=sēung héi|l=double joy}}), a popular decorative design composed of two stylized characters 喜 ({{zh|p=xǐ|cy=héi|l=joy}}).

The number 8 is viewed as such an auspicious number that even being assigned a number with several eights is considered very lucky.

* Similar to the common Western practice of using "9" for price points, it is common to see "8" being used in its place to achieve the same [[psychological pricing|psychological effect]].So for example menu prices like $58, $88 are frequently seen.

==Nine==
The number [[9 (number)|9]] (九, {{zh|p=jiǔ|cy=gáu}}) was historically associated with the [[Emperor of China]], and the number was frequently used in matters relating to the Emperor, before the establishment of the [[imperial examinations]] officials were organized in the [[nine-rank system]], the [[nine bestowments]] were rewards the Emperor made for officials of extraordinary capacity and loyalty, while the [[nine familial exterminations]] was one of the harshest punishments the Emperor sentenced; the Emperor's robes often had nine dragons, and [[Chinese mythology]] held that the dragon has nine children.
Also, the number [[9 (number)|9]] sounds like "long lasting" (久, {{zh|p=jiǔ|cy=gáu}}), so it is often used in [[wedding]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2114">A '''contrast set''' is a bounded collection of items, each of which could fill the same slot in a given [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], syntactic structure, or other linguistic environment. The seven days of the week, the fifty United States, the eight Hawaiian islands, the letters in the alphabet, the categories "male" and "female," the students in a class, or the flavors on offer at an ice cream store are all examples of contrast sets.

Contrast sets may be relatively natural in origin (such as the eight Hawaiian islands) or relatively conventional (such as the fifty United States). The mastery of certain conventional contrast sets is essential to basic socialization: for example, calendrical units, [[musical notes]], and elements of writing systems like [[Numeral system|numerals]] and the [[alphabet]]. These contrast sets frequently become the subject of [[synesthesia]]s.

[[Linguistic anthropology|Linguistic anthropologists]] [[Harold Conklin]] and [[Charles Frake]] were the first to work out the concept of the contrast set in the 1950s, and the concept was described in detail in Frake's article "The ethnographic study of cognitive systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles O. |last=Frake |chapter=The Ethnographic Study of Cognitive Systems |pages=28–41 |title=Cognitive Anthropology |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Tyler |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1969 |isbn=0-03-073255-7 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6aAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Google Sets program attempts to generate a list of the members of a contrast set given a few starter members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://labs.google.com/sets labs.google.com/sets] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327090414/https://labs.google.com/sets |date=March 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=April 2016}} the term contrast set has been used extensively in the field of [[data mining]].{{by whom|date=April 2016}}

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3672">A '''conversation opener''' is an introduction used to begin a [[conversation]]. They are frequently the subject of guides and [[seminar]]s on how to make friends and/or meet people. Different situations may call for different openers (e.g. approaching a stranger on the street versus meeting them at a more structured gathering of people with like interests).

An opener often takes the form of an open-ended question, which can lead to further comments or [[conversation]] as well as creating topics for future conversations (e.g. "How's your mandrill doing?").

A closed-ended question (e.g. "Nice weather today, isn't it?") is regarded as potentially less effective because it can be answered with a simple "Mm-hmm," which is essentially a conversational dead end, requiring the initiater of the conversation to start from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediacollege.com/journalism/interviews/open-ended-questions.html Media College]: Open-Ended Questions&lt;/ref&gt;

''How to Start a Conversation'' notes that in conversation openers, "There really are only two topics to choose from &amp;ndash; The situation [or] the other person. Secondly, there are only two ways to begin a conversation: State a fact [or] ask a question/opinion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persuasion-skills.co.uk/system/viewarticle.asp?ANUM=4 Persuasion Skills Ltd] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060925005828/http://www.persuasion-skills.co.uk/system/viewarticle.asp?ANUM=4 |date=2006-09-25 }}: How to Start a Conversation&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, openers are often linked to props, e.g. "Do you have a cigarette?" "Wow, you're reading ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', that's one of my favorite books..." "I like your skirt, where did you get it?" etc. Many venues, such as singles tennis events, etc. are geared toward prop-based conversation openers. Some people keep conversation pieces for this purpose.

Judy Ringer's ''We Have to Talk: A Step-By-Step Checklist for Difficult Conversations'' points out that an entirely different set of openers may be used for sensitive conversations, e.g. about employee performance, in which a main goal may be to avoid putting the person on the defensive. These openers often take the form of I statements, e.g. "I have something I’d like to discuss with you that I think will help us work together more effectively".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hodu.com/checklist.shtml We Have to Talk: A Step-By-Step Checklist for Difficult Conversations] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711052446/http://hodu.com/checklist.shtml |date=2012-07-11 }} by Judy Ringer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversation openers in sales settings==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}In sales settings, conversation openers often are used to probe the subject for information. Topic chosen are on 'safe ground' like 'the weather' or 'how was your journey to get here'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallas.net/~scotpeck/saleswebpage/conver.htm Sales Feature Article "Conversation Openers"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/19991105120622/http://www.dallas.net/~scotpeck/saleswebpage/conver.htm |date=1999-11-05 }} by Scott Peck&lt;/ref&gt; This information can then be used in attempts to counter objections.

This type of conversation opener is often referred to as [[small talk]] and is used to make both people in a conversation feel comfortable. The book ''Get Noticed''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wegetnoticed.com Get Noticed] Get Noticed' by Marcus A Taylor and Rob Lawrence&lt;/ref&gt; by Marcus A Taylor and Rob Lawrence explains how mastering the art of small talk involves active listening, being up to date with current affairs as well as identifying common interests to develop the conversation.

Darbar is a Persian-derived term (from Persian: دربار - darbār) meaning the court or place of discussion of king, Prince, ruler or noble court. It was later used in [[Pakistan]], India and [[Nepal]] for a ruler's court or feudal levee as the latter came to be ruled and later administered by foreigners. A darbar may be either a [[feudal]] state council for administering the affairs of a princely state, or a [[Muslim]] [[shrine]] like [[Data Darbar|data darbar]] in [[Lahore]].

'''De-categorialization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|or]] '''de-categorialisation''') in [[linguistics]], refers to one of the five principles by which [[grammaticalization]] can be detected while it is taking place (according to [[Paul Hopper]]). The other four are [[Layering (linguistics)|layering]], [[Divergence (linguistics)|divergence]], [[specialization (linguistics)|specialization]], and [[persistence (linguistics)|persistence]].

De-categorialization can be described as the loss of [[morphosyntactic]] properties.

The '''disquotational principle''' is a philosophical [[theorem]]{{Citation needed|reason=What/where is the proof?|date=January 2018}} which holds that a rational speaker will accept "''p''" if and only if he or she believes ''p''. The quotes indicate that the statement ''p'' [[use–mention distinction|is being treated as a sentence, and not as a proposition]]. This principle is presupposed by claims that hold that [[First-order_logic#Equality_and_its_axioms|substitution]] fails in certain [[intension]]al contexts.

==Overview==
Consider the following argument:
:(1) Sally accepts the assertion that "[[Cicero]] was a famous [[orator]]" while dissenting from the assertion that "Tully was a famous [[orator]]".
:(2) Cicero is Tully
:Therefore, (3) Sally believes that Tully was a famous orator.

To derive (3), we have to assume that when Sally accepts that "Cicero was a famous orator", she believes that Cicero was a famous orator. Then we can exchange Cicero for Tully, and derive (3). [[Bertrand Russell]] thought that this demonstrated the failure of substitutivity of identicals in [[intension]]al contexts.

In "A Puzzle about Belief,"&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief." First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A. Margalit. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argues that the application of the disquotational theorem can yield a paradox on its own, without appeal to the substitution principle, and that this may show that the problem lies with the former, and not the latter. There are various formulations of this argument.

Suppose that, Pierre, a Frenchman, comes to believe that (1) "''Londres est jolie''" (London is pretty), without ever having visited the city. Later in life, Pierre ends up living in London. He finds no French speakers there (he does not speak English yet), and everyone refers to the city as "London," not ''Londres''. He finds this city decidedly unattractive, for the neighborhood he decides to live in is decidedly unattractive. Over time, he learns English, and formulates the belief that (2) "''London is not pretty''". Pierre never realizes that London is the English word for ''Londres''. Now with the disquotational principle, we can deduce from (1) that Pierre believes the proposition that ''Londres est jolie''. With a weak principle of translation (e.g., "a proposition in language A is the same as a semantically identical proposition in language B" [note that a proposition is not the same as a sentence]), we can now deduce that Pierre believes that London is pretty. But we can also deduce from (2) and the disquotational principle that Pierre believes that London is not pretty. These deductions can be made ''even though Pierre has made no logical blunders in forming his beliefs''. Without the disquotational principle, this contradiction could not be derived, because we would not be able to assume that (1) and (2) meant anything in particular.

This paradox can also be derived without appeal to another language. Suppose that Pierre assents to the proposition that "[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] had musical talent", perhaps having heard that this man was a famous pianist. With the disquotational principle, we can deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had musical talent. Now suppose that Pierre overhears a friend discussing the political exploits of a certain statesman, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]], without knowing that the two Paderewskis are the same man. Pierre's background tells him that statesmen are generally not very gifted in music, and this leads him to the belief that Paderewski had no musical talent. The disquotation principle allows us to deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had no musical talent. Using this principle, we have now deduced that Pierre believes that Paderewski had musical talent, and does not believe that Paderewski had musical talent, ''even though Pierre's beliefs were formed logically''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept used in [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. It refers to the two-level structure inherent to a [[sign system]], insofar as it is composed by two kinds of elements: 1) significant or meaningful, and 2) distinctive or meaningless.

==Theory==
''Double articulation''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also "double segmentation".&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the two fold structure of the stream of speech, which can be primarily divided into ''meaningful'' signs (like words or [[morphemes]]), and then secondarily into ''distinctive'' elements (like letters or [[phonemes]]). For example, the meaningful English word "cat" is composed of the sounds [k], [æ], and [t], which are meaningless as separate individual sounds (and which can also be combined to form the separate words "tack" and "act", with distinct meanings). These sounds, called [[phonemes]], represent the secondary and lowest level of articulation in the hierarchy of the organization of speech. Higher, primary, levels of organization (including [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]]) govern the combination of these individually meaningless phonemes into meaningful elements.

==History==
The French concept of ''double articulation'' was first introduced by the [[André Martinet]],&lt;ref&gt;André Martinet, ''Éléments de linguistique générale'', Colin, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949. The English calque ''double articulation'' has been criticised as inaccurate and is often replaced by ''duality of patterning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3935606 | pmid=24587833 | doi=10.1515/langcog-2012-0014 | volume=4 | title=New perspectives on duality of patterning: Introduction to the special issue | year=2012 | journal=Lang Cogn | pages=251–259 | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | last2 = Sandler | first2 = W | last3 = Kirby | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles F. Hockett]] and other linguists, this duality is an important property of human languages, since it allows for the expression of a potentially infinite number of meaningful language sequences. Strictly speaking, however, such expressiveness follows from [[generativity]] or [[Productivity_(linguistics)|productivity]] (a finite number of components combining via rules to produce a potentially infinite arrangement of novel utterances), not of duality per se (one could have a system with 2 levels of the kind referred to as duality, and yet have only finite productivity. For further discussion, see [[figurae]], as well as [[Hockett's_design_features]], which treats productivity and duality as distinct essential properties of language.

[[Sign language]]s may have less double articulation because more gestures are possible than sound and able to convey more meaning without double articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedivy|first1=Julie|title=The Unusual Language That Linguists Thought Couldn’t Exist|url=http://nautil.us/blog/the-unusual-language-that-linguists-thought-couldnt-exist|website=Nautilus|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ems Ukaz plaque in Bad Ems.JPG|thumb|right|157px|Plaque dedicated to Ems Ukraz in [[Bad Ems]].]]
The '''Ems Ukaz''', or ''Ems Ukase'' ({{lang-ru|Эмский указ}}, ''Emskiy ukaz''; {{lang-uk|Емський указ}}, ''Ems’kyy ukaz''), was a secret decree (''[[ukaz]]'') of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]] issued in 1876, banning the use of the [[Ukrainian language]] in print, with the exception of reprinting of old documents. The ukaz also forbade the import of Ukrainian publications and the staging of plays or lectures in Ukrainian. It was named after the city of [[Bad Ems]], [[Germany]], where it was promulgated.

== Background ==

In the 1860s, a decade and a half after the Imperial Russian government had broken up the [[Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius]] in [[Kiev]] (March 1847), and exiled or arrested its founder [[Nikolay Kostomarov]] and other prominent figures, Ukrainian intellectuals were gaining further awareness of their cultural background.  ''[[Hromada]]'' cultural associations (named after the traditional village assembly) started in a number of cities, and Sunday schools started in the cities and towns (the Russian Imperial administration had neglected education).  The new cultural movement was partly driven by publications in both Russian and Ukrainian, including journals (such as Kostomarov's ''Osnova'', 1861–62, and [[Leonid Hlibov|Hlibov]]'s ''Chernyhosvs’kyy Lystok'', 1861–63), historical and folkloristic monographs (Kostomarov's biography of the Cossack hetman [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], [[Panteleimon Kulish|Kulish]]'s two-volume folklore collection ''Zapiski o Yuzhnoy Rusi'', ''Notes on Southern Rus''', 1856–57), and elementary primers (Kulish's ''Hramatka'', 1857, 1861, [[Taras Shevchenko|Shevchenko]]'s ''Bukvar Yuzhnoruskiy'', 1861&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;).  In ''Osnova'', Kostomarov published his influential article "Dve russkiye narodnosti" ("Two Russian Nationalities").

Although Ukrainianism had been considered popular and somewhat chic in Russian cultural circles, a debate began at the time over its relation to the ideology of Russian [[Pan-Slavism]]—epitomized by a quotation of [[Pushkin]]: "will not all the Slavic streams merge into the Russian sea?"—and a rhetoric of criticism emerged. Conservative Russians called the Ukrainian movement a "Polish intrigue", while Polish commentators had been complaining that Ukrainianism had been used as a weapon against Polish culture in [[right-bank Ukraine]].

After the 1861 [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] in the [[Russian Empire]], many landowners were unhappy with the loss of their serfs, while peasants were generally displeased with the terms of the emancipation.  In this atmosphere of discontent, increasing reports reached the imperial government that Ukrainian leaders were plotting to separate from Russia. The 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland raised tensions around the issue of ethnic separatism in general even further.  Several Ukrainian activists were arrested, Sunday schools and hromadas were closed and their publication activities were suspended.

A new Ukrainian translation by [[Pylyp Morachevskyi]] of parts of the [[New Testament]] was vetted and passed by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]], but rejected by the [[Most Holy Synod|Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox church]], because it was considered politically suspect.&lt;ref name=Zerk_morachev&gt;{{Ru icon}}/{{uk icon}} Volodymyr Kozyrsky, Vasyl Shenderovsky, "The spiritual valour of Pylyp Morachevsky (to the bicentenary anniversary of his birth)", ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]] (the Mirror Weekly)'', 5–19 August 2006, [http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/ie/show/609/54147/ in Russian]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, [http://www.zn.kiev.ua/ie/show/609/54147/ in Ukrainian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311010339/http://www.zn.kiev.ua/ie/show/609/54147 |date=2007-03-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Interior Minister Count [[Pyotr Valuyev]] issued a decree through an internal document circulated to the censors on 18 July 1863, known as  [[Valuyev's Circular]]. The Circular implemented a policy based on his opinion that "the Ukrainian language never existed, does not exist, and shall never exist".  It banned the publication of secular and religious books (apart from ''[[belles-lettres]]''), on the premise that not only is the content of such publications potentially questionable, but their very existence implied the anti-imperial idea that a Ukrainian nation could exist.

== Ems Ukaz ==

In the 1870s, the Kiev [[Hromada]] and the South-Western Branch of the Imperial [[Russian Geographic Society]] began to publish important works in Kiev, in Russian, about Ukrainian ethnography.  Authors included [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]], [[Volodymyr Antonovych]], [[Ivan Rudchenko]], and [[Pavlo Chubynsky]].  They held an Archaeological Congress in 1874, and published in the Russian-language paper ''Kievskiy telegraf''.

A member of the Geographic Society, [[Mikhail Yuzefovich]], sent two letters to [[St Petersburg]] warning of separatist activity.  [[Tsar Alexander II]] appointed an Imperial Commission on Ukrainophile Propaganda in the Southern Provinces of Russia, which found evidence of a danger to the state, and recommended extending the scope of the Valuyev decree.  While enjoying a spa in [[Bad Ems]], Germany, in May 1876, the Tsar signed what would come to be called the "Ems Ukaz", extending the [[publication ban]] to apply to all books and song [[lyrics]] in the "Little Russian dialect", and to prohibit the [[import]]ation of such materials.  Public lectures, plays, and song performances in Ukrainian were forbidden, suspect teachers removed from teaching, and presumably dangerous organizations and newspapers shut down.

The ukaz coincided with other actions against [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian culture]]. Drahomanov and fellow activist [[Mykola Ziber]] were sacked from their posts at Kiev's [[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv|University of St Vladimir]], and emigrated along with other cultural leaders such as [[Fedir Vovk]] and [[Serhiy Podolynsky]].  The situation was exposed by professor Mykhailo Drahomanov at the 1878 Paris International Literary Congress.

In 1881, the new [[Tsar Alexander III]] amended the ukaz.  Ukrainian lyrics and dictionaries would be allowed, but the ''Kulishivka'' [[Ukrainian alphabet]] was still prohibited, and such publications would have to employ Russian orthography (disparagingly called the ''Yaryzhka'' by some Ukrainians, after the Russian letter [[yery]], ы).  Performance of Ukrainian plays and humorous songs could be approved by local authorities, but Ukrainian-only [[theatre]]s and troupes could not be established.

Many illegal performances and publications were delivered through ingenuity and [[bribery]], but Ukrainian cultural development practically ceased.

== Aftermath ==

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]] recommended that the ukaz's restrictions be lifted. Ukrainian-language [[newspaper]]s began publication, ''[[Prosvita]]'' (‘Enlightenment’) educational societies were formed, some university professors lectured in Ukrainian, and the Orthodox bishop of the [[Podolia]] vicariate, Parfeniy Levytsky, allowed the language to be used in services and church schools there.

In 1910, concerned about potential revolutionary activity, Interior Minister [[Pyotr Stolypin]] restored the ukaz's restrictions and shut down the Prosvita societies and Ukrainian-language publications.  Russian-language press and intellectuals launched a campaign against the idea of Ukrainian autonomy or separatism.

Thus, self-aware Ukrainians remained a small intelligentsia in [[Dnieper Ukraine]], out of touch with a much larger rural population who lacked the opportunity for a cultural education.  Russian imperial ideology dominated the schools and the army, and the [[Russian language]] was the only one used for official business in the urban workplace, government offices, and public services.  In the meantime, Ukrainian self-identity would grow in Austro-Hungarian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], out of reach of Russian imperial authorities.

The ukaz was never cancelled, but became void along with all other imperial Russian laws in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917–18. [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|After the Revolution]], Ukrainian language, education and culture was allowed to flower in the [[Ukrainian National Republic]], the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], and under the [[Ukrainization#1923-1931: Early years of Soviet Ukraine|Ukrainization]] policies of [[Soviet Ukraine]] before 1931.

The '''''Etymologicum Genuinum''''' (standard abbreviation '''''E Gen''''') is the conventional modern title given to a [[Lexicography|lexical]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] in the mid ninth century. The anonymous compiler drew on the works of numerous earlier lexicographers and [[scholiasts]], both ancient and recent, including [[Aelius Herodianus]], [[Georgius Choeroboscus]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], [[Orion of Thebes]], [[Oros of Alexandria]] and  [[Theognostus the Grammarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 1-69; Alpers (1969) 3-24; Alpers (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' was possibly a product of the intellectual circle around [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. It was an important source for the subsequent Byzantine lexicographical tradition, including the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'', ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]'' and ''[[Etymologicum Symeonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1972); Rance (2007) 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship discovered the ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' only in the nineteenth century. It is preserved in two tenth-century [[manuscripts]], ''Codex Vaticanus Graecus'' 1818 (= A) and ''Codex Laurentianus Sancti Marci'' 304 (= B; AD 994). Neither contains the earliest [[recension]] nor the complete text, but rather two different abridgements. The manuscript evidence and citations in later works suggest that the original title was simply τὸ Ἐτυμολογικόν and later τὸ μέγα Ἐτυμολογικόν. Its modern name was coined in 1897 by [[Richard Reitzenstein]], who was the first to edit a sample section.&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 11-44&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' remains for the most part unpublished except for specimen glosses.&lt;ref&gt;Colonna (1967); Alpers (1969); Berger (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Two editions are in long-term preparation, one begun by [[Ada Adler]] and continued by [[Klaus Alpers]],&lt;ref&gt;Alpers (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the other by [[François Lasserre]] and [[Nikolaos Livadaras]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasserre and Livadaras (1976- )&lt;/ref&gt; The latter edition is published under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum'', but this designation is not widely used and is a potential source of confusion with the twelfth-century lexical compendium conventionally titled the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.

The '''farfallino alphabet''' (in [[italian language|Italian]] '''alfabeto farfallino''') is a [[Language game (linguistics)|language game]] used primarily in [[Italy]], which can be regarded as an elementary form of [[substitution cipher]]. It is usually used by [[child]]ren for amusement or to converse in (perceived) privacy from [[adult]]s. The name "farfallino" comes from the word "farfalla" (butterfly), which is an ordinary Italian word but sounds like the "codified" words in farfallino alphabet. The farfallino alphabet is similar to games found in other languages such as [[jeringonza]] ([[spanish language|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), [[langue de feu]] ([[french language|French]]), [[Fay Kee Bolee]] ([[Urdu]]) and [[pig latin]] ([[English language|English]]).

==Rules and variations==
The usual rules for farfallino alphabet are based on the substitution of each vowel with a 3 letter sequence where the vowel itself is repeated with an interceding ''f''.
 
* [[:wikt:casa#Italian|casa]] → ca'''fa'''sa'''fa'''
* [[:wikt:lago#Italian|lago]] → la'''fa'''go'''fo'''
* [[:wikt:stella#Italian|stella]] → ste'''fe'''lla'''fa'''
* [[:wikt:re#Italian|re]] → re'''fe'''
* [[:wikt:cercare#Italian|cercare]] → ce'''fe'''rca'''fa'''re'''fe'''

&lt;blockquote style="background: ccccff; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;"&gt; Here is an example:
:''Quefestofo èfe ufun efesefempifiofo difi frafasefe ifin afalfafabefetofo fafarfafallifinofo. Nofon èfe fafacifilefe, afanchefe peferchèfe vafa defettofo ifil pifiùfu vefelofocefe pofossifibifilefe''
Its translation in Italian is:
:Questo è un esempio di frase in alfabeto farfallino. Non è facile, anche perché va detto il più veloce possibile
Which means, in English:
:This is an example of phrase in Farfallino Alphabet. It is not easy, also because you should say it as fast as possible.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are several minor variations to this scheme. One such variation is based on the following substitution rules: 
* a → agasa
* e → eghese
* i → ighisi
* o → ogoso
* u → ugusu

Although rules for ''e'' and ''i'' look different, they are not; the additional ''h'' is needed in Italian to enforce a [[voiced velar plosive]] sound for letter ''g'', which is implicit in the other combinations. Another more complicated scheme, which is used in some regions of Italy, is as follows:
* a → aufer
* e → enghel
* i → ix
* o → older
* u → uflez

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8363">'''Free writing'''  is a [[prewriting]] technique in which a person writes continuously for a set period of time without regard to spelling, grammar, or topic. It produces raw, often unusable material, but helps writers overcome blocks of apathy and self-criticism. It is used mainly by [[prose]] writers and writing teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/GRAMMAR/composition/brainstorm_freewrite.htm |title=Getting Started: Freewriting |publisher=Grammar.ccc.commnet.edu |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconsciouslife.com/liberate-your-mind-with-free-writing.htm|title=Liberate Your Mind with Free Writing|publisher=theconsciouslife.com|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[writers]] use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic, often as a preliminary to formal writing. Free writing is not the same as [[automatic writing]].

Unlike [[brainstorming]] where ideas are simply listed, in freewriting one writes sentences to form a paragraph about whatever comes to mind.

==History==
[[Dorothea Brande]] was an early proponent of freewriting. In her book ''Becoming a Writer'' (1934), she advises readers to sit and write for 30 minutes every morning, as fast as they can.

[[Peter Elbow]] advanced freewriting in his book ''Writing Without Teachers'' (1975), and it has been popularized by [[Julia Cameron]] through her book ''The Artist's Way'' (1992).

==Technique==
The technique involves continuous writing, usually for a predetermined period of time (often five to fifteen minutes). The writer writes without regard to spelling, grammar, etc., and makes no corrections.  If the writer reaches a point where they can't think of anything to write, it is presumed they will ''write'' that they can't think of anything or repeat words, until they find another line of thought. The writer freely strays off topic, letting thoughts lead where they may. At times, a writer may also do a focused freewrite, letting a chosen topic structure their thoughts. Expanding from this topic, the thoughts may stray to make connections and create more abstract views on the topic. This technique helps a writer explore a particular subject before putting ideas into a more basic context.

Freewriting is often done on a daily basis as a part of the writer's daily routine. Also, students in many writing courses are assigned to do such daily writing exercises.

The writing does not have to be done with pen and paper. A technique known as Freeblogging combines [[blog]]ging with free-writing with the rules changed so that the writer does not stop typing for long periods of time. The end result may or may not be shared with the public.

==Definition==
Free writing is based on a presumption that, while everybody has something to say and the ability to say it, the mental wellspring may be blocked by apathy, self-criticism, resentment, anxiety about deadlines, fear of failure or censure, or other forms of resistance. The accepted rules of free-writing enable a writer to build up enough momentum to blast past blocks into uninhibited flow, the concept outlined by writing teachers such as Louise Dunlap, [[Peter Elbow]], and [[Natalie Goldberg]].&lt;ref name="Cole2001"&gt;{{cite journal

Free-writing is all about loosening and limbering the thought process, not about a product or a performance for a student or a writer.&lt;ref name="Robinson1967"&gt;{{cite journal

==Use in education==
Often free-writing workshops focus on self-expression, and are sometimes even used in teaching to [[elementary school]] children. There is no common consensus on the acceptance of this technique.&lt;ref name="Klingman1985"&gt;{{cite journal

*Give yourself a time limit. Write for one or ten or twenty minutes, and then stop.
*Keep your hand moving until the time is up. Do not pause to stare into space or to read what you've written. Write quickly but not in a hurry.
*Pay no attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, neatness, or style. Nobody else needs to read what you produce here. The correctness and quality of what you write do not matter; the act of writing does.
*If you get off the topic or run out of ideas, keep writing anyway. If necessary, write nonsense or whatever comes into your head, or simply scribble: anything to keep the hand moving.
*If you feel bored or uncomfortable as you're writing, ask yourself what's bothering you and write about that.
*When the time is up, look over what you've written, and mark passages that contain ideas or phrases that might be worth keeping or elaborating on in a subsequent free-writing session.

Goldberg's rules appear to be based on those developed by [[Jack Kerouac]], whom she cites several times. Kerouac developed 30 "rules" in his Belief &amp; Technique for Modern Prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/kerouac-technique.html|title=Kerouac on technique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Kerouac's "rules" are elliptical and even cryptic for beginning writers, they are more comprehensive than Goldberg's for those who have practised prose writing for some time. Kerouac supplemented these with his Essentials of Spontaneous Prose,&lt;ref name="writing.upenn.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/kerouac-spontaneous.html|title=Kerouac, Spontaneous Prose|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together they form the basis of his prose writing method, a form of narrative [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]. Kerouac himself cites the "trance writing" of [[William Butler Yeats]] as a precursor of his own practice.&lt;ref name="writing.upenn.edu"/&gt;

Goldberg's rules, which are infused with the study and practice of Zen Buddhism, make the process of free writing more accessible for a beginner and are perhaps less extreme than those of Kerouac, although they are still tinged with an element of mysticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11196">A '''genderless language''' is a [[natural language|natural]] or [[constructed language|constructed]] [[language]] that has no distinctions of [[grammatical gender]]—that is, no categories requiring [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between nouns and associated pronouns, adjectives, articles, or verbs.&lt;ref name=braun1&gt;[[Yasir Suleiman]] (ed.) (1999) "Language and Society in the Middle East and North Africa", {{ISBN|0-7007-1078-7}}, Chapter 10: "Gender in a genderless language: The case of Turkish", by Friederike Braun&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "genderless language" must not be confused with that of [[gender-neutral language]]. Also, a discourse in a genderless language is not necessarily [[gender-neutral]],&lt;ref name=braun1/&gt; although genderless languages exclude many possibilities for reinforcement of [[gender]]-related stereotypes, such as using masculine pronouns when referring to persons by their occupations (although some languages that may be identified as genderless, including [[Gender in English|English]], do have distinct male and female pronouns). A lack of gendered pronouns is also distinct from a lack of gender in the grammatical sense.

Genderless languages do have various means to recognize gender, such as gender-specific words (''mother'', ''son'', etc., and distinct pronouns such as ''he'' and ''she'' in some cases), as well as gender-specific context, both biological and cultural.&lt;ref name=braun1/&gt;

Genderless languages are listed at [[List of languages by type of grammatical genders]]. Genderless languages include the [[Indo-European languages]] [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Central Kurdish|Central Kurdish (Sorani Dialect)]], all the [[Uralic languages]] (such as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]), all the modern [[Turkic languages]] (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], all the [[Austronesian languages]] (such as the [[Polynesian languages]]), and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

== Language contact ==

=== Morphological view ===
From the morphological point of view, grammatical gender may arise because of [[language contact]].  These were called "universal simplifications" in the reduction of sex system.{{Incomprehensible inline|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuteva|first1=Bernd Heine ; Tania|title=Language contact and grammatical change|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521608282|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2017}} Surveys about [[gender systems]] around the world from 256 languages show that 112 (44%) are grammatical gender and 144 languages (56%) are genderless languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(eds.)|first1=Martine Vanhove ...|title=Morphologies in Contact.|date=2012|publisher=Akademie Verlag Berlin|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3050057019|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these two types of languages in many cases are geographically close to each other, there is a significant chance that one influences the other. For example, the [[Basque language]] is considered a genderless language, but it has been influenced by the Spanish feminine-masculine [[Grammatical gender in Spanish|two-gender]] system. Although it should be noted, there are 6909 recognized languages in the world, thus a sample of 256 languages constitutes roughly 3.7% of all spoken languages. Thus, although this particular survey indicates a high proportion of gender neutrality, it does not take into account the other 96.3% of languages.

=== Loaned from other languages ===
Gender has been associated with words but not with ideas. Scholars are trying to study the development of gender in nouns that have been borrowed from other languages. One example of this innovation is the gender assignment of the genderless English nouns that were borrowed into the Italian spoken by immigrants to America. The phonological form of the loaned word sometimes determines its sex. For example, Italians who immigrated to America do not identify the word freezer, but instead heard "freezə." This sound is similar to schwa /a/, so the word becomes "frisa." Consequently, the new word ends in /a/ which is feminine. The same happens with the words water (la vuora), the sweater (la suera), and the quarter (la quora). This process happens also in American-German and American-French. In English words ending in -ing, it sounds like French -ine and in German -ung which are feminine suffixes. In this case, the genderless nouns do not generate one gender or another. In the American-Italian language, masculine gender is the default gender. This default automatically happens in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Norwegian, and Old English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabeno|first1=Angela|last2=Repetti|first2=Lori|title=Gender Assignment of English Loan Words in American Varieties of Italian|journal=American Speech|date=undefined NaN|volume=72|issue=4|pages=373|doi=10.2307/455494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===

While English is virtually gender free grammatically as compared with German or French, it is not a genderless language. The elaborate grammatical gender of Old English has mostly disappeared in Modern English but it still remains in pronouns and possessive adjectives: He, him, his. She, her, hers. There is however no grammatical distinction with verbs, adjectives or nouns. Persian (Farsi), a related language in the Indo-European language family altogether lacks grammatical gender lacking the few vestigial remnants that English has which explains how Persian is a genderless language while English is not.

Early graphism then was a form of [[writing]] that constitutes a 'symbolic transposition, not copying of [[reality]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heelstone.com/meridian/cheek/damntheory.html Riding the Meridian: Domestic Ambient Noise/Moise]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The birth of graphism==
The earliest traces of graphism date back to 30,000 years BC at the end of the [[Mousterian]] period and became more prevalent in the [[Chatelperronian|Chatelperronian period]] toward 35,000 BC{{Citation needed|reason=A credible source can probably handle "BC".|date=September 2010}}. While it can be claimed that language merely represents a logical development of the vocal signals of the animal world, nothing comparable to the writing and reading of symbols existed before the dawn of [[homo sapiens]]. While [[Muscle|motor function]] determines expression in the techniques and language of all [[Simian|anthropoids]], [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] determines graphism in the figurative language of the most recent anthropoids.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

It has been hypothesized that graphism first appeared in the form of tight curves or series of lines engraved in bone or stone. However, there has been no substantial proof to support this [[hypothesis]], with the only comparison being the [[Australia]]n [[tjurunga]], stone or wood tablets engraved with abstract designs (spirals, straight lines, and clusters of dots) that represented objects of religious significance. The first forms of graphism that allow one to hazardly identify an animal, did not appear until around 30,000 B.C. Prehistoric art records are very numerous, and [[Statistics|statistical processing]] has allowed us to unravel the general meaning of what they represented. The earliest known paintings do not represent a hunt or a family scene, but are graphic building blocks without any associated description.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; All these early forms therefore suggests that figurative art was directly linked with language and was, in the broadest sense, much closer to writing  than to what we understand by a [[work of art]]. It was symbolic transposition, not copying of reality, that is to say that graphism did not begin start by reproducing reality in a slavishly photographic manner, but with abstraction.

The discovery of [[prehistoric art]] in the late 19th century raised the issue of a "naive" state, an art by which humans supposedly represented what they saw as a result of an aesthetic triggering effect.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; It was soon realized near the beginning of the 20th century that this view was mistaken, and that magical-religious concerns were responsible for the figurative art of the [[Cenozoic|Cenozoic Era]], as indeed for almost all art except in a few rare "hunting tallies" etched on bone during the [[Paleolithic]] period.

'''ISO/TC 37''' is a technical [[committee]] within the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) that prepares [[Technical standard|standards]] and other [[documents]] concerning [[methodology]] and principles for [[terminology]] and [[language resources]].

'''Title: Terminology and other language and content resources'''

'''Scope: [[Standardization]] of principles, methods and applications relating to [[terminology]] and other [[language]] and content [[resources]] in the [[contexts]] of [[multilingual]] [[communication]] and cultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]]'''

ISO/TC 37 is a so-called "horizontal committee", providing guidelines for all other technical committees that develop standards on how to manage their terminological problems. However, the standards developed by ISO/TC 37 are not restricted to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. Collaboration with [[industry]] is sought to ensure that the requirements and needs from all possible users of standards concerning terminology, language and structured content are duly and timely addressed.

Involvement in standards development is open to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and requests can be made to the TC through any liaison or member organization (see the list of current members and liaisons of ISO/TC 37:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48104&lt;/ref&gt;)

ISO/TC 37 standards are therefore fundamental and should form the basis for many [[Internationalization and localization|localization]], [[translation]], and other [[industry]] [[Industrial application|applications]].

==ISO/TC 37 "Terminology and other language and content resources"==
International Standards are developed by [[expert]]s from [[industry]], [[academia]] and [[business]] who are [[delegates]] of their national standards institution or another [[organization]] in liaison. Involvement, therefore, is principally open to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. They are based on consensus among those national standards institutes who collaborate in the respective committee by way of membership.

ISO/TC 37 develops [[International Standards]] concerning:
* terminological principles and methods
* vocabulary of terminology and language resource management
* terminology work
* preparation and management of language resources
* preparation and layout of terminology standards
* [[computer]]ized terminography and [[lexicography]]
* terminology [[documentation]]
* coding and [[code]]s in the field of terminology and other language resources
* applications of terminology and other language resources in [[language engineering]] and [[content management]]
* translation, interpreting and related technology

ISO/TC 37 looks upon a long [[history]] of terminology unification activities. In the past, terminology experts - even more so experts of terminology [[theory]] and methodology - had to struggle for wide recognition. Today their [[expertise]] is sought in many application areas, especially in various fields of standardization. The emerging multilingual [[information society]] and [[knowledge society]] will depend on reliable [[Digital data|digital]] content. [[Terminology]] is indispensable here. This is because terminology plays a crucial role wherever and whenever specialized [[information]] and [[knowledge]] is being prepared (e.g. in [[research and development]]), used (e.g. in specialized [[Textbook|texts]]), recorded and processed (e.g. in data banks), passed on (via [[training]] and [[teaching]]), implemented (e.g. in technology and knowledge transfer), or translated and interpreted. In the age of [[globalization]] the need for methodology standards concerning multilingual [[Digital data|digital]] [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] is increasing - ISO/TC 37 has developed over the years the [[expertise]] for methodology standards for [[science]] and [[technology]] related content in textual form.

==Terminology standardization==
The beginnings of terminology standardization are closely linked to the standardization efforts of IEC ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]], founded in 1906) and ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]], founded in 1946).

A terminology standard according to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] Guide 2 (1996) is defined as "standard that is concerned with terms, usually accompanied by their [[definition]]s, and sometimes by explanatory notes, [[illustration]]s, examples, etc."

ISO 1087-1:2000 defines [[terminology]] as ''"set of designations belonging to one special language" and designations as "[[Representation (systemics)|representation]] of a [[concept]] by a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] which denotes it".'' Here, concept representation goes beyond terms (being only linguistic signs), which is also supported by the state-of-the-art of terminology science, according to which terminology has three major functions:

# basic elements carrying meaning in [[Domain Name System|domain]] [[communication]],
# ordering of scientific-technical [[knowledge]] at the level of concepts,
# access to other representations of specialized information and knowledge.

The above indicates that terminological [[data]] (comprising various kinds of knowledge representation) possibly have a much more fundamental role in domain-related information and knowledge than commonly understood.

Today, terminology standardization can be subdivided into two distinct activities:
* standardization of terminologies,
* standardization of terminological principles and methods.

The two are mutually [[interdependent]], since the [[standardization]] of terminologies would not result in high-quality terminological data, if certain common principles, rules and methods are not observed. On the other hand, these standardized terminological principles, rules and methods must reflect the state-of-the-art of theory and methodology development in those domains, in which terminological data have to be standardized in connection with the formulation of subject standards.

Terminology gained a special position in the field of standardization at large, which is defined as ''"activity of establishing, with regard to actual or potential [[problem]]s, provisions for common and repeated use, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context"'' (ISO/IEC 1996). Every technical committee or sub-committee or working group has to standardize subject matters, define and standardize its respective terminology. There is a consensus that terminology standardization precedes subject standardization (or "subject standardization requires terminology standardization").

==History of ISO/TC 37==
ISO/TC 37 was put into operation in 1952 in order "to find out and formulate general principles of terminology and terminological lexicography" (as terminography was called at that time).

The [[history]] of terminology standardization proper - if one excludes earlier attempts in the field of [[metrology]] - started in the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), which was founded in [[London]] in 1906 following a recommendation passed at the International Electrical Congress, held in [[St. Louis]], United States, on 15 September 1904, to the extent that: ''"...steps should be taken to secure the co-operation of the technical societies of the world, by the appointment of a representative Commission to consider the question of the standardization of the [[nomenclature]] and ratings of [[electric]]al [[Electrical equipment|apparatus]] and [[machinery]]".'' From the very beginning, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] considered it its foremost task to standardize the terminology of electrotechnology for the sake of the quality of its subject standards, and soon embarked upon the International Electrotechnical [[Vocabulary]] (IEV), whose first edition, based on many individual terminology standards, was published in 1938. The IEV is still being continued today, covering 77 chapters as parts of the International Standard series IEC 60050. The IEV [[Online]] [[Database]] can be accessed on Electropedia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electropedia.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427022958/http://www.electropedia.org/ |archivedate=2015-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessor to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the International Federation of Standardizing Associations (ISA, founded in 1926), made a similar experience. But it went a step further and - triggered by the publication of [[Eugen Wüster]]'s book "Internationale Sprachnormung in der Technik" [International standardization of technical language] (Wüster 1931) - established in 1936 the Technical Committee ISA/TC 37 "Terminology" for the sake of formulating general principles and rules for terminology standardization.

ISA/TC 37 conceived a scheme of four classes of recommendations for terminology standardization mentioned below, but the [[Second World War]] interrupted its [[Innovator|pioneering]] work. Nominally, ISO/TC 37 was established from the very beginning of ISO in 1946, but it was decided to re-activate it only in 1951 and the Committee started operation in 1952. Since then until 2009 the secretariat of ISO/TC 37 has been held by the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm),&lt;ref name="infoterm"&gt;http://www.infoterm.org&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the [[Austrian Standards Institute]] Austria. Infoterm,&lt;ref name="infoterm" /&gt; an [[international non-governmental organization]] based in Austria, continues to collaborate as a [[twin towns and sister cities|twinning]] [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]]. After this the administration went to CNIS (China).

==Objective of ISO/TC 37==
To prepare standards specifying principles and methods for the preparation and [[management]] of language resources within the framework of standardization and related activities. Its technical work results in [[International Standards]] (and Technical Reports) covering terminological principles and methods as well as various aspects of [[computer-assisted]] terminography. ISO/TC 37 is not responsible for the co-ordination of the terminology standardizing activities of other ISO/TCs.

'''Internet linguistics''' is a domain of [[linguistics]] advocated by the English linguist [[David Crystal]]. It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen under the influence of the [[Internet]] and of other [[new media]], such as [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) [[text messaging]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) leading to [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts{{who?|date=May 2018}} have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web usability. Such study aims to benefit both linguists and web users.&lt;ref name=" Linguistics and web usability "&gt;{{Cite journal

The study of Internet linguistics can take place through four main perspectives: [[#socp|sociolinguistics]], [[#ep|education]], [[#sp|stylistics]] and [[#ap|applied]] linguistics.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"/&gt; Further dimensions have developed as a result of further technological advances - which include the development of the Web as [[text corpus | corpus]] and the spread and influence of the stylistic variations brought forth by the spread of the Internet, through the [[mass media]] and through [[literary works]]. In view of the increasing number of users connected to the Internet, the linguistics future of the Internet remains to be determined, as new computer-mediated technologies continue to emerge and people adapt their languages to suit these new media.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The Internet continues to play a significant role both in encouraging as well as in diverting attention away from the usage of languages.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"/&gt;

==Main perspectives==

David Crystal has identified four main perspectives for further investigation – the sociolinguistic perspective, the educational perspective, the stylistic perspective and the applied perspective.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The four perspectives are effectively interlinked and affect one another.

=== {{anchor|socp}}Sociolinguistic perspective ===
This perspective deals with how society views the impact of Internet development on languages.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The advent of the Internet has revolutionized communication in many ways; it changed the way people communicate and created new platforms with far-reaching social impact. Significant avenues include but are not limited to SMS text messaging, [[e-mails]], [[Online chat|chatgroups]], [[virtual worlds]] and the Web.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

The evolution of these new mediums of communications has raised much concern with regards to the way language is being used. According to Crystal (2005), these concerns are neither without grounds nor unseen in history – it surfaces almost always when a new technology breakthrough influences languages; as seen in the 15th century when [[printing]] was introduced, the 19th century when the [[telephone]] was invented and the 20th century when [[broadcasting]] began to penetrate our society.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

At a personal level, CMC such as SMS Text Messaging and mobile e-mailing ([[push mail]]) has greatly enhanced instantaneous communication.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; Some examples include the [[iPhone]] and the [[BlackBerry]].

In schools, it is not uncommon for educators and students to be given personalized school e-mail accounts for communication and interaction purposes.  Classroom discussions are increasingly being brought onto the Internet in the form of discussion forums. For instance, at [[Nanyang Technological University]], students engage in collaborative learning at the university’s portal – edveNTUre, where they participate in discussions on forums and online quizzes and view streaming podcasts prepared by their course instructors among others. [[iTunes U]] in 2008 began to collaborate with universities as they converted the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] music service into a store that makes available academic lectures and scholastic materials for free – they have partnered more than 600 institutions in 18 countries including [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities.&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry"&gt;{{Cite news

| newspaper = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]
| date = 7 March 2008
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

These forms of academic social networking and media are slated to rise as educators from all over the world continue to seek new ways to better engage students. It is commonplace for students in [[New York University]] to interact with “guest speakers weighing in via [[Skype]], library staffs providing support via [[instant messaging]], and students accessing library resources from off campus.”&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"&gt;{{Cite news
| title = Universities Use Social Media to Connect
| first = Peter
| last = Cohen
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/education/31iht-riedsoc.html?_r=1
| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]
| date = 30 March 2010
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will affect the way language is used as students and teachers begin to use more of these CMC platforms.&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"/&gt;

At a professional level, it is a common sight for companies to have their computers and laptops hooked up onto the Internet (via wired and wireless [[Internet connection]]), and for employees to have individual e-mail accounts. This greatly facilitates internal (among staffs of the company) and external (with other parties outside of one’s organization) communication. Mobile communications such as [[smart phones]] are increasingly making their way into the corporate world. For instance, in 2008, Apple announced their intention to actively step up their efforts to help companies incorporate the iPhone into their enterprise environment, facilitated by technological developments in streamlining integrated features (push e-mail, calendar and contact management) using [[ActiveSync]].&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry" /&gt;

In general, these new CMCs that are made possible by the Internet have altered the way people use language – there is heightened informality and consequently a growing fear of its deterioration. However, as David Crystal puts it, these should be seen positively as it reflects the power of the creativity of a language.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

====Themes====

The sociolinguistics of the Internet may also be examined through five interconnected themes.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"&gt;{{cite book

# [[Multilingualism]] – It looks at the prevalence and status of various languages on the Internet.
# [[Language change]] – From a sociolinguistic perspective, language change is influenced by the physical constraints of technology (e.g. typed text) and the shifting social-economic priorities such as globalization. It explores the linguistic changes over time, with emphasis on [[Internet lingo]].
# [[Conversation analysis|Conversation discourse]] – It explores the changes in patterns of social interaction and communicative practice on the Internet.
# Stylistic diffusion – It involves the study of the spread of Internet jargons and related linguistic forms into common usage. As language changes, conversation discourse and stylistic diffusion overlap with the aspect of language stylistics.
#:''See below: [[#sp|Stylistic perspective]]''
# [[Metalanguage]] and [[folk linguistics]] – It involves looking at the way these linguistic forms and changes on the Internet are labelled and discussed (e.g. impact of Internet lingo resulted in the 'death' of the apostrophe and loss of capitalization.)

==={{anchor|ep}}Educational perspective===
The educational perspective of internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on [[formal language]] use, specifically on [[Standard English]], which in turn affects [[language education]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, but are not limited to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; Such [[acronyms]] exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include ''[[lol]]'' (for laughing out loud; a general expression of laughter), ''[[SMS language#Common abbreviations|omg]]'' (oh my god) and ''gtg'' (got to go).&lt;ref name="The Influence of Internet on Language and Email Stress"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational perspective has been considerably established in the research on the Internet's impact on language education. It is an important and crucial aspect as it affects and involves the education of current and future student generations in the appropriate and timely use of informal language that arises from [[Internet usage]]. There are concerns for the growing infiltration of informal language use and incorrect word use into academic or formal situations, such as the usage of casual words like "guy" or the choice of the word "preclude" in place of "precede" in academic papers by students. There are also issues with spellings and grammar occurring at a higher frequency among students' academic works as noted by educators, with the use of abbreviations such as "u" for "you" and "2" for "to" being the most common.&lt;ref name="No LOL Matter: Cyber lingo shows up in academia"&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003448269_student26.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists and professors like Eleanor Johnson suspect that widespread mistakes in writing are strongly connected to Internet usage, where educators have similarly reported new kinds of spelling and grammar mistakes in student works. There is, however, no [[scientific evidence]] to confirm the proposed connection.&lt;ref name="Experts divided over Internet changes to Language"&gt;{{cite news

| first = Rachel
| last = Abrams
| publisher = [[Voanews.com|VOANews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are valid concerns about Internet usage and its impact on students' academic and formal writing, its severity is however enlarged by the informal nature of the new media platforms. [[Naomi Baron|Naomi S. Baron]] (2008)  argues in ''Always On'' that student writings suffer little impact from the use of Internet-mediated communication (IMC) such as internet chat, SMS text messaging and e-mail.&lt;ref name="Always On"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2009 published by the [[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] found that students who regularly texted (sent messages via SMS using a mobile phone) displayed a wider range of vocabulary and this may lead to a positive impact on their reading development.&lt;ref name="Texting improves language skill"&gt;{{cite news

| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the use of the Internet resulted in stylistics that are not deemed appropriate in academic and formal language use, it is to be noted that Internet use may not hinder language education but instead aid it. The Internet has proven in different ways that it can provide potential benefits in enhancing language learning, especially in second or [[Foreign language teaching|foreign language learning]]. Language education through the Internet in relation to Internet linguisitics is, most significantly, applied through the communication aspect (use of e-mails, [[discussion forums]], [[Instant messaging|chat messengers]], [[blog]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"&gt;{{cite web

| last = Xie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IMC allows for greater interaction between language learners and native speakers of the language, providing for greater error corrections and better learning opportunities of standard language, in the process allowing the picking up of specific skills such as negotiation and persuasion.&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"/&gt;

==={{anchor|sp}}Stylistic perspective===
This perspective examines how the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged new and different forms of creativity in language, especially in literature.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study because it is an amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst "&gt;{{Cite news

 |archivedate = 2010-02-13
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst"/&gt;

Future research also includes new varieties of expressions that the Internet and its various technologies are constantly producing and their effects not only on written languages but also their spoken forms.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The communicative style of Internet language is best observed in the CMC channels below, as there are often attempts to overcome technological restraints such as transmission time lags and to re-establish social cues that are often vague in written text.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt;

====Mobile phones====
{{see also|mobile phone}}
Mobile phones (also called "cell phones") have an expressive potential beyond their basic communicative functions. This can be seen in text-messaging poetry competitions such as the one held by [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The 160-character limit imposed by the cell phone has motivated users to exercise their linguistic creativity to overcome them.  A similar example of new technology with character constraints is [[Twitter]], which has a 280-character limit.  There have been debates as to whether these new abbreviated forms introduced in users’ [[wikt:Special:Search/tweet|Tweet]]s are "lazy" or whether they are creative fragments of communication. Despite the ongoing debate, there is no doubt that Twitter has contributed to the linguistic landscape with new lingoes and also brought about a new dimension of communication.&lt;ref name=" From Telegraph to Twitter: The Language of the Short Form "&gt;{{Cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cell phone has also created a new literary genre – [[cell phone novels]]. A typical cell phone novel consists of several chapters which readers download in short installments. These novels are in their "raw" form as they do not go through editing processes like traditional novels. They are written in short sentences, similar to text-messaging.&lt;ref name="Thumbs Race as Japan’s Best Sellers Go Cellular"&gt;{{Cite news

| accessdate = 2010-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors of such novels are also able to receive feedbacks and new ideas from their readers through e-mails or online feedback channels. Unlike traditional novel writing, readers’ ideas sometimes get incorporated into the storyline or authors may also decide to change their story’s plot according to the demand and popularity of their novel (typically gauged by the number of download hits).&lt;ref name="Cell Phones Put to Novel Use"&gt;{{cite news

====Blogs====
{{see also|blog}}

Blogging has brought about new ways of writing diaries and from a linguistic perspective, the language used in blogs is "in its most 'naked' form",&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; published for the world to see without undergoing the formal editing process. This is what makes blogs stand out because almost all other forms of printed language have gone through some form of editing and standardization.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David
|title = Language and the Internet
|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-86859-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Crystal stated that blogs were "the beginning of a new stage in the evolution of the written language".&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; Blogs have become so popular that they have expanded beyond written blogs,&lt;ref name=" Success of blogs heralds an even bigger future"&gt;{{cite news

These developments in interactive blogging have created new linguistic conventions and styles, with more expected to arise in the future.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

====Virtual worlds====
{{see also|virtual worlds}}

Virtual worlds provide insights into how users are adapting the usage of natural language for communication within these new mediums. The Internet language that has arisen through user interactions in text-based chatrooms and [[computer-simulated]] worlds has led to the development of slangs within digital communities. Examples of these include [[pwn]] and [[noob]]. [[Emoticons]] are further examples of how users have adapted different expressions to suit the limitations of cyberspace communication, one of which is the "loss of emotivity".&lt;ref name="On The Linguistic Nature of Cyberspace and Virtual Communities"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication in niches such as [[role-playing game]]s (RPG) of [[MUDs|Multi-User domains]] (MUDs) and virtual worlds is highly interactive, with emphasis on speed, brevity and spontaneity.  As a result, CMC is generally more vibrant, volatile, unstructured and open. There are often complex organization of sequences and exchange structures evident in the connection of conversational strands and short turns. Some of the CMC strategies used include capitalization for words such as ''EMPHASIS'', usage of symbols such as the asterisk to enclose words as seen in ''*stress*'' and the creative use of punctuation like ''???!?!?!?''.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt; Symbols are also used for discourse functions, such as the asterisk as a [[Conversation analysis#Repair|conversational repair]] marker and arrows and carats as [[deixis]] and [[referent]] markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren B.|date=2012-03-01|title=The discourse deictics ∧ and &lt;-- in a World of Warcraft community|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211695812000050|journal=Discourse, Context &amp; Media|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–19|doi=10.1016/j.dcm.2012.05.002|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/17348/|archive-date=21 Feb 2013}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren Brittany|date=2011-02-01|title=*-repair in Online Discourse|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610003152|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|series=The Language of Space and Time|volume=43|issue=3|pages=918–921|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.09.025|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/20621/|archive-date=21 Feb 2014}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides contributing to these new forms in language, virtual worlds are also being used to teach languages. [[Virtual world language learning]] provides students with simulations of real-life environments, allowing them to find creative ways to improve their language skills. Virtual worlds are good tools for language learning among the younger learners because they already see such places as a "natural place to learn and play".&lt;ref name=" Language Teaching Gains Second Life: Virtual Worlds Offer New Methods to Teach Languages "&gt;{{Cite press release

====E-mail====
{{See also|email}}

One of the most popular Internet-related technologies to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the stylistics of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style.&lt;ref name="baron"&gt;{{cite journal

| accessdate = 2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal stylistics.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

While e-mail has been blamed for students’ increased usage of informal language in their written work, David Crystal argues that e-mail is "not a threat, for language education" because e-mail with its array of stylistic expressiveness can act as a domain for language learners to make their own linguistic choices responsibly. Furthermore, the younger generation’s high propensity for using e-mail may improve their writing and communication skills because of the efforts they are making to formulate their thoughts and ideas, albeit through a digital medium.&lt;ref name=" Say so long to traditional letter writing "/&gt;

====Instant messaging====
{{See also|instant messaging}}

Like other forms of online communication, instant messaging has also developed its own acronyms and short forms. However, instant messaging is quite different from e-mail and chatgroups because it allows participants to interact with one another in real-time while conversing in private.&lt;ref name="7 things you should know about…Instant Messaging "&gt;{{Cite journal

This increased degree of intimacy allows greater informality in language and "typographical idiosyncrasies". There are also greater occurrences of stylistic variation because there can be a very wide age gap between participants. For example, a granddaughter can catch up with her grandmother through instant messaging. Unlike chatgroups where participants come together with shared interests, there is no pressure to conform in language here.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

==={{anchor|ap}}Applied perspective===
[[File:Language on internet.JPG|thumb|alt=|Source: [http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats]]]
The applied perspective views the linguistic exploitation of the Internet in terms of its communicative capabilities – the good and the bad.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The Internet provides a platform where users can experience multilingualism. Although English is still the dominant language used on the Internet, other languages are gradually increasing in their number of users.&lt;ref name="Thurlow" /&gt; The [[Global Internet usage]] page provides some information on the number of users of the Internet by language, nationality and geography. This multilingual environment continues to increase in diversity as more language communities become connected to the Internet. The Internet is thus a platform where minority and [[endangered language]]s can seek to revive their language use and/or create awareness. This can be seen in two instances where it provides these languages opportunities for progress in two important regards - [[language documentation]] and [[language revitalization]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

====Language documentation====
{{See also|Language documentation}}
Firstly, the Internet facilitates language documentation. Digital archives of media such as audio and video recordings not only help to preserve language documentation, but also allows for global dissemination through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity about endangered languages, such as Webster (2003) has helped to spur a worldwide interest in linguistic documentation.

Foundations such as the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project (HRELP), funded by Arcadia also help to develop the interest in linguistic documentation. The HRELP is a project that seeks to document endangered languages, preserve and disseminate documentation materials among others. The materials gathered are made available online under its Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR) program.

Other online materials that support language documentation include the Language Archive Newsletter which provides news and articles about topics in endangered languages. The web version of Ethnologue also provides brief information of all of the world’s known living languages. By making resources and information of endangered languages and language documentation available on the Internet, it allows researchers to build on these materials and hence preserve endangered languages.

====Language revitalization====
{{See also|language revitalization}}

Secondly, the Internet facilitates language revitalization. Throughout the years, the digital environment has developed in various sophisticated ways that allow for virtual contact. From e-mails, chats to instant messaging, these virtual environments have helped to bridge the spatial distance between communicators. The use of e-mails has been adopted in language courses to encourage students to communicate in various styles such as conference-type formats and also to generate discussions.&lt;ref name="Singhal"&gt;{{cite journal

| first = Meena
| last = Singhal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken can take advantage of the Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone broadband communication such as [[Skype]], language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

Hawaiian educators have been taking advantage of the Internet in their language revitalization programs.&lt;ref name="Warschauer"&gt;{{cite journal

The content, interface and menus of the system are entirely in the Hawaiian language. It is installed throughout the immersion school system and includes components for e-mails, chat, dictionary and online newspaper among others. In higher institutions such as colleges and universities where the Leoki system is not yet installed, the educators make use of other software and Internet tools such as Daedalus Interchange, e-mails and the Web to connect students of Hawaiian language with the broader community.&lt;ref name="Warschauer2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the Internet includes having students of minority languages write about their native cultures in their native languages for distant audiences. Also, in an attempt to preserve their language and culture, [[Occitan]] speakers have been taking advantage of the Internet to reach out to other Occitan speakers from around the world.  These methods provide reasons for using the minority languages by communicating in it.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal

====Exploitation of the Internet====
::''See also: [[Forensic linguistics]]''

The Internet can also be exploited for activities such as [[terrorism]], [[internet fraud]] and [[pedophilia]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as e-mails and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="BAAS"&gt;{{cite news

From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a chat room [[Content-control software|child protection procedure]] based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; In other areas, it is observed that the [[Semantic Web]] has been involved in tasks such as personal [[data protection]], which helps to prevent fraud.&lt;ref name="Ryan Lee"&gt;{{cite book

==Dimensions==

The dimensions covered in this section include looking at the Web as a corpus and issues of language identification and normalization. The impacts of internet linguistics on everyday life are examined under the spread and influence of Internet stylistics, trends of language change on the Internet and conversation discourse.

===The Web as a corpus===

With the Web being a huge reservoir of data and resources, language scientists and technologists are increasingly turning to the web for language data.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"&gt;{{Cite journal

It was met with much controversy as they lacked theoretical integrity leading to much skepticism of their role in the field,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; until the publication of the journal ‘Using Large Corpora’ in 1993&lt;ref name="computational linguistics using large corpora"&gt;{{Cite journal

To establish whether the Web is a corpus, it is worthwhile to turn to the definition established by McEnery and Wilson (1996, pp 21).&lt;ref name="McEnery000”"&gt;{{Cite book

====Themes====

There has been much discussion about the possible developments in the arena of the Web as a corpus. The development of using the web as a data source for word sense disambiguation was brought forward in The EU MEANING project in 2002.&lt;ref name="rigau000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of [[language modeling]], the Web has been used to address data sparseness. Lexical statistics have been gathered for resolving prepositional phrase attachments,&lt;ref name="volk000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of information retrieval, a Web track was integrated as a component in the community’s TREC evaluation initiative. The sample of the Web used for this exercise amount to around 100GB, compromising of largely documents in the .gov top level domain.&lt;ref name="hawking000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====British National Corpus====
{{See also|British National Corpus}}

The [[British National Corpus]] contains ample information on the dominant meanings and usage patterns for the 10,000 words that forms the core of English.

The number of words in the British National Corpus (ca 100 million) is sufficient for many empirical strategies for learning about language for linguists and lexicographers,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baker001"&gt;{{Cite conference

However, for some other purposes, it is insufficient, as an outcome of the [[Zipfian distribution|Zipfian]] nature of word frequencies. Because the bulk of the lexical stock occurs less than 50 times in the British National Corpus, it is insufficient for statistically stable conclusions about such words. Furthermore, for some rarer words, rare meanings of common words, and combinations of words, no data has been found. Researchers find that probabilistic models of language based on very large quantities of data are better than ones based on estimates from smaller, cleaner data sets.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====The multilingual Web====

{{Update||date=March 2017|inaccurate=yes|talk=The data about percentage of  languages on internet pages is from year 2000 and is no longer accurate.}}

The Web is clearly a multilingual corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Ivković, D. (2013). The Eurovision Song Contest on YouTube: A corpus-based analysis of language attitudes. Language@Internet, 10, article 1. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-35977)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 71% of the pages (453 million out of 634 million Web pages indexed by the Excite engine) were written in English, followed by Japanese (6.8%), German (5.1%), French (1.8%), Chinese (1.5%), Spanish (1.1%), Italian (0.9%), and Swedish (0.7%).&lt;ref name="xu000"&gt;{{Cite conference

A test to find contiguous words like ‘deep breath’ revealed 868,631 Web pages containing the terms in [[AlltheWeb]]. The number found through the search engines are more than three times the counts generated by the British National Corpus, indicating the significant size of the English corpus available on the Web.

The massive size of text available on the Web can be seen in the analysis of controlled data in which corpora of different languages were mixed in various proportions. The estimated Web size in words by [[AltaVista]] saw English at the top of the list with 76,598,718,000 words. The next is German, with 7,035,850,000 words along with 6 other languages with over a billion hits. Even languages with fewer hits on the Web such as Slovenian, Croatian, Malay, and Turkish have more than one hundred million words on the Web.&lt;ref name="grenstette000"&gt;{{Cite conference

As Web texts are easily produced (in terms of cost and time) and with many different authors working on them, it often results in little concern for accuracy. Grammatical and typographical errors are regarded as “erroneous” forms that cause the Web to be a dirty corpus. Nonetheless, it may still be useful even with some noise.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The issue of whether [[sublanguage]]s should be included remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue that with all sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language is made up of lexicons, grammar and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until recently that it became a viable option. Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The decision of what to include in a corpus lies with corpus developers, and it has been done so with pragmatism.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The desiderata and criteria used for the British National Corpus serves as a good model for a general-purpose, general-language corpus&lt;ref name="atkins001"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the focus of being representative replaced with being balanced.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

Search engines such as [[Google]] serves as a default means of access to the Web and its wide array of linguistics resources. However, for linguists working in the field of corpora, there presents a number of challenges. This includes the limited instances that are presented by the search engines (1,000 or 5,000 maximum); insufficient context for each instance (Google provides a fragment of around ten words); results selected according to criteria that are distorted (from a linguistic point of view) as search term in titles and headings often occupy the top results slots; inability to allow searches to be specified according to linguistic criteria, such as the citation form for a word, or word class; unreliability of statistics, with results varying according to search engine load and many other factors. At present, in view of the conflicts of priorities among the different stakeholders, the best solution is for linguists to attempt to correct these problems by themselves. This will then lead to a large number of possibilities opening in the area of harnessing the rich potential of the Web.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====Representation====

Despite the sheer size of the Web, it may still not be representative of all the languages and domains in the world, and neither are other corpora. However, the huge quantities of text, in numerous languages and language types on a huge range of topics makes it a good starting point that opens up to a large number of possibilities in the study of corpora.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

===Impact of its spread and influence===

Stylistics arising from Internet usage has spread beyond the new media into other areas and platforms, including but not limited to, [[films]], [[music]] and [[literary works]]. The infiltration of Internet stylistics is important as mass audiences are exposed to the works, reinforcing certain Internet specific language styles which may not be acceptable in standard or more formal forms of language.

Apart from internet slang, grammatical errors and typographical errors are features of writing on the Internet and other CMC channels. As users of the Internet gets accustomed to these errors, it progressively infiltrates into everyday language use, in both written and spoken forms.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; It is also common to witness such errors in mass media works, from typographical errors in news articles to grammatical errors in advertisements and even internet slang in drama dialogues.

The more the internet is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This is especially true in modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book ''&lt;u&gt;Teaching Grammar and Usage&lt;/u&gt;'' states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teaching Grammar and Usage|last = Lester|first = Mark|publisher = Allyn and Bacon|year = 2001|isbn = 0205306551|location = Boston|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.

==== Mass media ====

There has been instances of television advertisements using Internet slang, reinforcing the penetration of Internet stylistics in everyday language use. For example, in the [[Cingular Wireless|Cingular]] commercial in the United States, acronyms such as "BFF Jill" (which means "Best Friend Forever, Jill") were used. More businesses have adopted the use of Internet slang in their advertisements as the more people are growing up using the Internet and other CMC platforms, in an attempt to relate and connect to them better.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such commercials have received relatively enthusiastic feedback from its audiences.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"/&gt;

The use of [[Internet lingo]] has also spread into the arena of music, significantly seen in [[popular music]]. A recent example is [[Trey Songz|Trey Songz's]] lyrics for "LOL :-)", which incorporated many Internet lingo and mentions of Twitter and texting.&lt;ref name="Trey Songz LOL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.treysongz.com/music/lol-ft-gucci-mane-soulja-boy/ | title = LOL :-) Ft. Gucci Mane &amp; Soulja Boy Tell 'Em | work = Song | first = Trey | last = Songz | authorlink = Trey Songz | publisher = Trey Songz| accessdate = 2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Internet linguistics is also present in [[films]] made by both commercial and [[independent filmmakers]]. Though primarily screened at [[film festivals]], DVDs of independent films are often available for purchase over the internet including paid-live-streamings, making access to films more easily available for the public.&lt;ref name="LOL - The Movie"&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very nature of commercial films being screened at public cinemas allows for the wide exposure to the mainstream mass audience, resulting in a faster and wider spread of Internet slangs. The latest commercial film is titled "LOL" (acronym for ''Laugh Out Loud'' or ''Laughing Out Loud''), starring [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Demi Moore]].&lt;ref name="Miley Cyrus' Movie 'LOL' Picked Up By Distributor"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of internet slangs is not limited to the English language but extends to other languages as well. The [[Korean language]] has incorporated the English alphabet in the formation of its slang, while others were formed from common misspellings arising from fast typing. The new [[Korean slang]] is further reinforced and brought into everyday language use by television shows such as [[soap operas]] or comedy dramas like “[[High Kick Through the Roof]]” released in 2009.&lt;ref name="Korean Language in Contemporary Society"&gt;[[Korean Language in Contemporary Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic future of the Internet==

With the emergence of greater computer/Internet mediated communication systems, coupled with the readiness with which people adapt to meet the new demands of a more technologically sophisticated world, it is expected that users will continue to remain under pressure to alter their language use to suit the new dimensions of communication.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

As the number of Internet users increase rapidly around the world, the cultural background, linguistic habits and language differences among users are brought into the Web at a much faster pace. These individual differences among Internet users are predicted to significantly impact the future of Internet linguistics, notably in the aspect of the multilingual web. As seen from 2000 to 2010, Internet penetration has experienced its greatest growth in non-English speaking countries such as China, India and Africa,&lt;ref name="Internet Usage Statistics"&gt;{{cite web

Also, the interaction between English and other languages is predicted to be an important area of study.&lt;ref&gt;Ivkovic, D., &amp; Lotherington, H. (2009). Multilingualism in cyberspace: Conceptualising the virtual linguistic landscape. International Journal of Multilingualism, 6(1), 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt; As global users interact with each other, possible references to different languages may continue to increase, resulting in formation of new Internet stylistics that spans across languages. Chinese and Korean languages have already experienced English language's infiltration leading to the formation of their multilingual Internet lingo.&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language"&gt;{{cite web

At current state, the Internet provides a form of education and promotion for minority languages. However, similar to how cross-language interaction has resulted in English language's infiltration into Chinese and Korean languages to form new slangs,&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language" /&gt; minority languages are also affected by the more common languages used on the Internet (such as English and Spanish). While language interaction can cause a loss in the authentic standard of minority languages, familiarity of the majority language can also affect the minority languages in adverse ways.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Language Matters with Bob Holman''''' is a 2015 documentary which focuses upon the rapid extinction of many of planet Earth's human languages and the  multifarious struggles and efforts to save and preserve them. Holman states that "There are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken in the world today. Languages have always come and gone but what is happening today is “a global crisis of massive proportions "... The feature is directed by [[David Grubin]] and narrated and hosted by Holman&lt;ref name="languagemattersfilm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemattersfilm.com|title=Language Matters with Bob Holman|publisher=languagemattersfilm.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film spans the globe to visit three geographic areas [[Australia]] (both out in the [[Outback]] of  and in the [[Goulburn Islands]] off  of the [[Northern Territory]]), [[Hawaii]] and [[Wales]] or as the film's own website explains..."Language Matters was filmed around the world: on a remote island off the coast of Australia where 400 Aboriginal people speak 10 different languages, all at risk; in Wales, where Welsh, once in danger, is today making a comeback; and in Hawaii, where [[Hawaiians]] are fighting to save their native tongue."&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3797498/|title=Language Matters with Bob Holman (2015) - IMDb|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="languagemattersfilm2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemattersfilm.com/press/|title=Language Matters with Bob Holman &amp;raquo; Press Room|publisher=languagemattersfilm.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was first broadcast on [[PBS]] in 2015 on the following dates; in New York City, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Washington, DC on January 25, 2015 then on January 27 in Columbus, Ohio, on January 29 in Chicago and Los Angeles, on February 5, Boston and finally on February 23, in Syracuse.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/norman-macafee/let-the-world-speak_b_6538298.html|title=Let the World Speak!&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;Norman MacAfee|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile the film is being streamed on the Public Broadcasting Service's webisite www.PBS.ORG.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.pbs.org/video/2365391566/|title=Video: Full Episode &amp;#124; Watch Language Matters Online &amp;#124; PBS Video|publisher=video.pbs.org|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

[[Levi Asher]] in writing for the online journal, ''[[Literary Kicks]]'' says in reviewing the film that... "it is a delightful and captivating two-hour documentary". He later concludes his commentary on the piece by stating,,,,  "Language Matters appears to be a television documentary about remote cultures and faraway peoples. It turns out to be a show about us all".&lt;ref name="litkicks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litkicks.com/LanguageMatters#.VOjDrkIiqlK|title="I'll Meet You Under The Words": Language Matters with Bob Holman|publisher=litkicks.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Best American Poetry]] in reviewing the program on their blog states ..."“Language Matters” is the first nationwide media recognition of the Language Crisis, which is not just about languages, but cultural diversity. It’s about global homogenization, the [[Pringles|Pringleization]] of society, about cultures being steamrolled under globalization"...&lt;ref name="bestamericanpoetry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/television/|title=The Best American Poetry: Television|publisher=blog.bestamericanpoetry.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Russia}}
Of all the '''languages of [[Russia]]''', [[Russian language|Russian]] is the only official language at the national level. There are 35 different languages which are considered [[official languages]] in various regions of Russia, along with Russian. There are over 100 minority languages spoken in Russia today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/russia-country-profile.html|title=Russia - Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette|publisher=Kwintessential.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531133402/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/russia-country-profile.html|archivedate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Russian was the sole official language of the [[Russian Empire]] which existed until 1917. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. The state helped develop [[alphabet]]s and [[grammar]] for various languages across the country that had previously been lacking a written form. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role, and superior status was reserved for Russian.

Russia lost its status in many of the new republics that arose following the 1991 [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. In Russia, however, the dominating status of the Russian language continued. Today, 97% of the public school students of Russia receive their education only or mostly in Russian, even though Russia is made up of approximately 80% ethnic [[Russians]].

==Official languages==
Although [[Russian language|Russian]] is the only federally [[official language]] of the [[Russian Federation]], there are several other officially recognized languages within Russia's various constituencies – article 68 of the [[Constitution of Russia]] only allows the various [[republics of Russia]] to establish official (state) languages other than Russian. This is a list of the languages that are recognized as official (state) in constitutions of the republics of Russia:

The Constitution of [[Dagestan]] defines "Russian and the languages of the peoples of Dagestan" as the state languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://constitution.garant.ru/region/cons_dagest/chapter/1/#block_11 Статья 11. Конституция Республики Дагестан]&lt;/ref&gt; though no comprehensive list of the languages was given.{{cn|date=October 2015}}{{dubious|date=October 2015}} In the project of the "Law on the languages of the Republic of Dagestan" 32 languages are listed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/printable/2014/02/03/reg-skfo/yaziki-anons.html В Дагестане сделают государственными 32 языка]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republic of Karelia|Karelia]] is the only [[republics of Russia|republic of Russia]] with Russian as the only official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://constitution.garant.ru/region/cons_karel/chapter/1/#block_11010 Статья 11. Конституция Республики Карелия]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists the special law about state support and protection of the [[Karelian language|Karelian]], [[Vepsian language|Vepsian ]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] languages in the republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karelia-zs.ru/zakonodatelstvo_rk/prav_akty/759-zrk/ Закон Республики Карелия «О государственной поддержке карельского, вепсского и финского языков в Республике Карелия»]&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal law "On the languages of the peoples of the Russian Federation" &lt;ref&gt;[http://base.garant.ru/10148970/ Закон РФ от 25 октября 1991 г. N 1807-I "О языках народов Российской Федерации" (с изменениями и дополнениями)]&lt;/ref&gt; allows the federal subjects to establish additionally official languages in the areas where minority groups live. This is the case, for example, of the [[Kazakh language]] in Altai Republic.&lt;ref name=LawAltai /&gt;

==Migrant languages==
As a result of mass migration to Russia from the former USSR republics (especially from the Caucasus and Central Asia) many non-indigenous languages are spoken by [[migrant worker]]s, among them most prominent are (from 2010 Census, in thousands):

{|
|-
|[[Armenian language|Armenian]]||830
|-
|[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]||515
|-
|[[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]||472
|-
|[[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]||245
|-
|[[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]]||247
|-
|[[Tajik language|Tajik]]||177
|-
|[[Georgian language|Georgian]]||102
|-
|[[Romanian language|Moldovan]]||90
|}

However, many migrant workers were not counted in the Census and many work illegally, so these numbers may be much greater. Compare 2.4 million Uzbek citizens and 1.2 million Tajik citizens entered Russia in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=XLS|url=http://www.russiatourism.ru/data/File/Statistika/2015/%D0%92%D1%8A%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%20%D0%B2%20%D0%A0%D0%A4%20%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%2050%202014.xls|script-title=ru:Страны, лидирующие по количеству прибытий на территорию Российской Федерации - Топ 50 по въезду в РФ за 2014 год (всего)|trans-title=Countries leading by the number of arrivals to the territory of the Russian Federation - Top 50 by entry into the RF for 2014 (total)|language=ru|publisher=RussiaTourism.ru|accessdate=11 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325030028/http://www.russiatourism.ru/data/File/Statistika/2015/%D0%92%D1%8A%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%20%D0%B2%20%D0%A0%D0%A4%20%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%2050%202014.xls|archivedate=25 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=December 2017}}

Some groups such as Kazakhs of [[Altay Republic]], Armenians from [[Myasnikovsky District]], Azerbaijanis from [[Derbentsky District|Derbent]] are not recent immigrants and have lived in their area for a long period of time.

==Endangered languages in Russia==
There are many [[endangered language]]s in Russia. Some are considered to be near extinction and put on the [[list of endangered languages in Russia]], and some may have gone extinct since data was last reported. On the other hand, some languages may survive even with few speakers.

Some languages have doubtful data, like [[Serbian language|Serbian]] whose information in the [[Ethnologue]] is based on the 1959 census.

===Languages near extinction===
Most numbers are according to [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]], 1995. Given the time that has passed, languages with extremely few speakers  might be extinct today. Since 1997, [[Kerek language|Kerek]] and [[Yugh language|Yugh]] have become extinct. 
* [[Ainu languages|Ainu]] (''extinct in Russia since 1994, still spoken in Japan'')
* [[Enets language|Enets]] (70)
* [[Tofalar language|Tofalar]] (25–30)
* [[Medny Aleut language|Medny Aleut]] (10) (an [[Aleut language|Aleut]]–Russian [[creole language]])
* [[Orok language|Orok]] (30–82)
* [[Akkala Sami|Sami, Akkala]] (''extinct since 2003'')
* [[Ter Sami|Sami, Ter]] (2)
* [[Udege language|Udege]] (100)
* [[Votic language|Votic]] (25)
* [[Northern Yukaghir language|Yukaghir, Northern]] (30–150)
* [[Southern Yukaghir language|Yukaghir, Southern]] (10–50)

===Other endangered languages===
*[[Chukchi language|Chukchi]]

== Foreign languages ==
According to the various studies made in 2005-2008 by [[Levada-Center]]&lt;ref name=Levada2008 /&gt; 15% of Russians know a foreign language. From those who claim knowledge of at least one language:
{| class="wikitable"
!colspan=2|"Can speak freely":
|-
| English || 80%
|-
| German || 16%
|-
| French || 4%
|-
| Turkish || 2%
|-
| Others || 9%
|-
|colspan=2|''From 1775 respondents aged 15-29, November 2006'' 
|}

{| class="wikitable"
!colspan=2|"Know enough to read newspapers":
|-
| English || 44%
|-
| German || 15%
|-
| Ukrainian, Belarusian and other Slavic languages || 19%
|-
| Other European languages || 10%
|-
| All others || 29%
|-
|colspan=2|''From 2100 respondents of every age, January 2005''
|}

Knowledge of at least one foreign language is predominant among younger and middle-aged population. Among aged 18–24 38% can read and "translate with a dictionary", 11% can freely read and speak. Among aged 25–39 these numbers are 26% and 4% respectively.

Knowledge of a foreign language varies among social groups. It is most appreciable (15-18%) in big cities with 100,000 and more inhabitants, while in Moscow it rises up to 35%. People with higher education and high economical and social status are most expected to know a foreign language.

The new study by Levada-Center in April 2014&lt;ref name=Levada2014 /&gt; reveals such numbers:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan=2| Can speak freely at least one language:
|-
| English || 11
|-
| German || 2
|-
| Spanish || 2
|-
| Ukrainian || 1
|-
| French || &lt;1
|-
| Chinese || &lt;1
|-
| Others || 2
|-
! Can speak a foreign language but with difficulty !! 13 
|-
! Do not speak a foreign Language at all !! 70 
|-
|colspan=2|''From 1602 respondents from 18 and older, April 2014''
|}

The age and social profiling are the same: knowledge of a foreign language is predominant among the young or middle-aged population with higher education and high social status and who live in big cities.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, French was a common language among upper class Russians. The impetus came from [[Peter the Great]]'s orientation of Russia towards Europe and accelerated after the [[French Revolution]]. After the Russians fought France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Russia became less inclined towards French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yegorov, Oleg|url=https://www.rbth.com/politics_and_society/2017/05/25/why-was-french-spoken-in-russia_770185|title=Why was French spoken in Russia?|publisher=''[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]''|date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages of education ==
Every year the Russian Ministry of Education and Science publishes statistics on the languages used in schools. In 2014/2015 absolute majority&lt;ref&gt;[http://минобрнауки.рф/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE/%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-2014/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-2014 Статистическая информация 2014. Общее образование]&lt;/ref&gt; (13.1 million or 96%) of 13.7 million Russian students used Russian as a medium of education. Around 1.6 million or 12% students studied their (non-Russian) native language as a subject. The most studied languages are Tatar, Chechen and Chuvash with 347, 253, 107 thousand students respectively.

The most studied foreign languages in 2013/2014 were (students in thousands):

A '''lead paragraph''' (sometimes shortened to '''lead'''; also spelled '''lede''') is the opening [[paragraph]] of an article, essay, book chapter, or other written work that summarizes its main ideas.&lt;ref name=mavensword20001128/&gt;

==Types of leads==
[[News style#Lead|Journalistic leads]] emphasize grabbing the attention of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peha &amp; Lester |title=Be a Writer: Your Guide to the Writing Life!: Proven Tips and Powerful Techniques to Help Young Writers Get Started |page=125 |publisher=Leverage Factory |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFMagLZx2vIC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=lede+newspaper&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=swajR-7mHI3azATIk7DzCA&amp;sig=01ouafTz7WfhQLt1up7epCRZ1JU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In journalism, the failure to mention the most important, interesting or attention-grabbing elements of a story in the first paragraph is sometimes called "burying the lead". Most standard news leads include brief answers to the questions of [[5 Ws|who, what, why, when, where, and how]] the key event in the story took place. In newspaper writing, the first paragraph that summarizes or introduces the story is also called the "blurb paragraph", "teaser text" or, in the United Kingdom, the "standfirst".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spark |first1=David |last2=Harris |first2=Geoffrey |title=Practical Newspaper Reporting |date=2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=9781473903340 |pages=89, 90, 94, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leads in essays summarize the outline of the argument and conclusion that follows in the main body of the essay. [[Encyclopedia]] leads tend to define the subject matter as well as emphasize the interesting points of the article. [[feature story|Features]] and general articles in [[magazine]]s tend to be somewhere between journalistic and encyclopedian in style and often lack a distinct lead paragraph entirely. Leads and [[book]] [[foreword]]s vary enormously in length, intent and content.

==Other introductions==
In [[journalism]], there is the concept of an introductory or summary line or brief paragraph, located immediately above or below the headline, and typographically distinct from the body of the article.&lt;ref name=Standfirst&gt;{{cite web|title=Standfirst|url=http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/standfirst/|work=[[Double-Tongued Dictionary]]|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be referred with a variety of terms, including: the ''standfirst'' (UK),&lt;ref name=Standfirst/&gt; ''rider'',{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ''kicker'' (US),&lt;ref name=Standfirst/&gt; ''bank head(line)'', ''deck'', ''dek'', or ''subhead'' (US).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} (See {{slink|News style|Terms and structure}}.)

In the [[Linguistics|study of language]], '''description''' or '''descriptive linguistics''' is the work of [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] analyzing and describing how [[language]] is actually used (or how it was used in the past) by a group of people in a speech community.

All academic research in [[linguistics]] is descriptive; like all other scientific disciplines, its aim is to describe the reality as it is, without the bias of preconceived ideas about how it ought to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić|first=Snježana|authorlink=Snježana Kordić|year=2010|language=Serbo-Croatian|title=Jezik i nacionalizam|trans-title=Language and Nationalism|url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|series=Rotulus Universitas|location=Zagreb|publisher=Durieux|page=60|isbn=978-953-188-311-5|lccn=2011520778|oclc=729837512|ol=15270636W|id={{COBISS|13436977}}|archivedate= 8 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690BiBe4T?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2015|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Moch.

Linguistic description is often contrasted with [[linguistic prescription]], which is found especially in [[education]] and in [[publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lawrence Trask|title=Key Concepts in Language and Linguistics|pages=47-48|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EE4dhRzavEgC|isbn=9780415157414|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Langer|title=Linguistic Purism in Action: How auxiliary tun was stigmatized in Early New High German|year=2013|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110881103|pages=223|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IZUiAAAAQBAJ|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescription seeks to define standard language forms and give advice on effective language use, and can be thought of as a presentation of the fruits of descriptive research in a learnable form, though it also draws on more subjective aspects of language aesthetics. Prescription and description are complementary, but have different priorities and sometimes are seen to be in conflict. Description is sometimes distinguished from "descriptivism", which is then defined as the belief that description is more significant or important to teach, study, and practice than prescription.

==Description==
As English-linguist Larry Andrews describes it, descriptive grammar is the linguistic approach that studies what a language is like, as opposed to prescriptive, which declares what a language should be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, descriptive grammarians focus analysis on how all sorts of people in all sorts of environments, usually in more casual, everyday settings, communicate, while prescriptive grammarians focus on the grammatical rules and structures predetermined by linguistic registers and figures of power for those who are under the control of said authorities to use. An example Andrews uses in his book is ''fewer than'' vs ''less than''.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A descriptive grammarian would state that both statements are correct, as long as the receiver of the message can understand the meaning behind the statement. A prescriptive grammarian, on the other hand, would analyze the rules and conventions behind the statements made and determine which statement is correct according to those rules. Andrews also believes that although the majority of linguists would be descriptive grammarians, the majority of public school teachers tend to be prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26" /&gt;

==Challenges==
Accurate description of real speech is a difficult problem, and linguists have often been reduced to approximations. Almost all linguistic theory has its origin in practical problems of descriptive linguistics. [[Phonology]] (and its theoretical developments, such as the [[phoneme]]) deals with the function and interpretation of sound in language. [[Syntax]] has developed to describe the rules concerning how words relate to each other in order to form sentences. [[Lexicology]] collects "words" and their derivations and transformations: it has not given rise to much generalized theory.

An extreme "mentalist" viewpoint denies that the linguistic description of a language can be done by anyone but a competent speaker. Such speakers have internalized something called "[[linguistic competence]]", which gives them the ability to extrapolate correctly from their experience new but correct expressions, and to reject expressions which do not convey meaning in the way the speaker intends. For example, an expression could be [[ambiguous]], possibly leading to several different interpretations by the listener. Depending on the speaker's intent, ambiguity can be desirable (as in [[joke]]s and other [[humor]]) or not. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A linguistic description is considered descriptively adequate if it achieves one or more of the following goals of descriptive linguistics:
# A description of the [[phonology]] of the language in question.
# A description of the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words belonging to that language.
# A description of the [[syntax]] of well-formed sentences of that language.
# A description of [[Derivation (linguistics)|lexical derivation]].
# A documentation of the [[vocabulary]], including at least one thousand entries.
# A reproduction of a few genuine texts.

The term "'''linguistic ecology'''" (also known as "'''ecolinguistics'''" or "'''language ecology'''") was first used in an article on the "language situation" in Arizona (Voegelin, Voegelin and Schutz, 1967).

==Description==
It was taken up by [[Einar Haugen]], who pioneered a form of [[linguistics]] which used the metaphor of an ecosystem to describe the relationships among the diverse forms of language found in the world, and the groups of people who speak them. Linguistic ecology looks at how languages interact with each other and the places they are spoken in, and frequently argues for the preservation of [[endangered language]]s as an analogy of the preservation of [[biological species]].

Linguistic ecology has often been described as a form of [[ecolinguistics]] (e.g., in Fill and Mühlhäusler). However, some claim that this is more properly considered a form of sociolinguistics, since the focus is on humans and language, rather than the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. Steffensen (2007) has argued that separation of the metaphorical 'linguistic ecology' from ecolinguistics would be reductionist, because high [[linguistic diversity]] is associated with high [[biological diversity]] (see Bastardas-Boada 2002). The relationship between linguistic diversity&lt;ref&gt;(Esperanto with English subtitles) Evildea, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5xdm1HcVdE Ĉu Esperanto savos aŭ estingos la aliajn lingvojn ?]'' (Will Esperanto save or extinguish the other languages), YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; and biodiversity is claimed to arise since local ecological knowledge is built into local language varieties and threatened if the local language is threatened by a more dominant language (see Mühlhäusler 1995). 

Linguistic ecology is represented by the journal ''Language Ecology'' which describes the field as follows:

"The ecology of language is a framework for the study of language as conceptualised primarily in Einar Haugen's 1971/72 work, where he defines language ecology as "the study of interactions between any given language and its environment". It was a reaction to the abstract notion of language – as a monolithic, decontextualised, static entity – propagated by [[Chomsky]], and it was conceived as a broad and interdisciplinary framework. In his use of 'ecology' as a metaphor from biology in linguistics, Haugen formulated ten questions which together comprehensively address factors pertaining to the positioning of languages in their environment. Each of these relates to a traditional sub-field of the study of language – encompassing historical linguistics, linguistic demography, sociolinguistics, contact, variation, philology, planning and policy,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010).  Analysis of language policy discourses across the scales of space and time. ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 202'', 7-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hornberger, N.H., &amp; Hult, F.M. (2008). Ecological language education policy. In B. Spolsky &amp; F.M. Hult (Eds.), ''Handbook of educational linguistics'' (pp. 280-296). Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; politics of language, [[ethnolinguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2009). Language ecology and linguistic landscape analysis. In E. Shohamy &amp; D. Gorter (Eds.), ''Linguistic landscape: Expanding the scenery'' (pp. 88-104). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and typology – and each of them intersects with one or more of the other sub-fields.

==Summary==
Taken together, answering some or all of these questions is part of the enterprise of the ecology of language. Since then the notion of ecology in linguistics has evolved to address matters of social, educational,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M.  (2012). Ecology and multilingual education. In C. Chapelle (Gen. Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of applied linguistics'' (Vol. 3, pp. 1835-1840).  Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; historical and developmental nature. With the development of ecology as a special branch of biology, and issues of the 20th and 21st centuries such as migration, hybridity and marginalisation coming to the fore, the notion of language ecology plays an important part in addressing broad issues of language and societal change, endangerment, human rights, as well as more theoretical questions of classification and perceptions of languages, as envisaged in Haugen's work" (''Language Ecology'' 2016).

'''Linguistic Intelligence''' is a part of [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences|multiple intelligence theory]] that deals with individuals' ability to understand both [[Spoken language|spoken]] and [[written language]], as well as their ability to speak and write themselves.  In a practical sense, linguistic intelligence is the extent to which an individual can use [[language]], both written and verbal, to achieve goals.&lt;ref name="FM 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez-Martinez|first=Fernando|author2=Kseniya Zablotskaya |author3=Wolfgang Minker |title=Text categorization methods for automatic estimation of verbal intelligence|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|date=Aug 2012|volume=39|issue=10|pages=9807–9820|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2012.02.173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, high linguistic intelligence has been linked to improved [[problem solving]], as well as to increased [[Abstraction|abstract reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Luwel 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luwel|first=Koen|author2=Ageliki Foustana |author3=Patrick Onghena |author4=Lieven Verschaffel |title=The role of verbal and performance intelligence in children's strategy selection and execution|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|date=Apr 2013|volume=24|pages=134–138|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2013.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, only the verbal aspects are taken into consideration. This is usually referred to as verbal intelligence or verbal fluency, and is commonly a reflection of an individual's overall linguistic intelligence.

==Physiologic and functional overview==
In order to understand linguistic intelligence, it is important to understand the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that control speech and language. These mechanisms can be broken down into four major groups: [[speech|speech generation]] (talking), [[Hearing|speech comprehension]] (hearing), [[Writing|writing generation]] (writing), and [[Reading (process)|writing comprehension]] (reading).

===Spoken language===

====Generation====

The first stage is planning, where the brain constructs words and sentences that turn the thought into an understandable form.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt; This occurs primarily in the [[inferior frontal cortex]], specifically in an area known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konrad|first=Andreas|author2=Goran Vucurevic |author3=Francesco Musso |author4=Georg Winterer |title=VBM-DTI Correlates of Verbal Intelligence: A Potential Link to Broca's area|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=Apr 2012|volume=24|issue=4|pages=888–895|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00187 |pmid=22220724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the brain must plan how to physically create the sounds necessary for speech by linking the planned speech with known sounds, or [[phonemes]]. While the location of these associations is not known, it is known that the [[supplementary motor area]] plays a key role in this step.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Penfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Penfield|first=Wilder|title=Speech and Brain-Mechanism|year=1959|publisher=Atheneum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the brain must signal for the words to actually be spoken. This is carried out by the [[premotor cortex]] and the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

[[File:Human motor cortex topography.png|thumb|right|[[Motor cortex]] with muscle [[localization of function|localization]] shown]]
In most cases, speech production is controlled by the left hemisphere. In a series of studies, [[Wilder Penfield]], among others, probed the brains of both right-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|left-hemisphere dominant]]) and left-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|right-hemisphere dominant]]) patients. They discovered that, regardless of [[handedness]], the left hemisphere was almost always the speech controlling side. However, it has been discovered that in cases of neural [[Stress (biology)|stress]] ([[hemorrhage]], [[stroke]], etc.) the right hemisphere has the ability to take control of speech functions.&lt;ref name=Doidge&gt;{{cite book|last=Doidge|first=Norman|title=The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comprehension ===
{{Main|Hearing}}
Verbal Comprehension is a fairly complex process, and it is not fully understood. From various studies and experiments, it has been found that the [[superior temporal sulcus]] activates when hearing human speech, and that speech processing seems to occur within [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Auditory feedback and feedforward====
Hearing plays an important part in both speech generation and comprehension. When speaking, the person can hear their speech, and the brain uses what it hears as a [[feedback]] mechanism to fix [[speech error]]s.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkell|first=Joseph|title=Movement goals and feedback and feed forward control mechanisms in speech production|journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics|date=Sep 2012|volume=25|issue=5|pages=382–407|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroling.2010.02.011|pmc=3361736}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a single [[feedback]] correction occurs multiple times, the brain will begin to incorporate the correction to all future speech, making it a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt; This is apparent in some deaf people. [[Deafness]], as well as other, smaller deficiencies in hearing, can greatly affect one's ability to comprehend spoken language, as well as to speak it.&lt;ref name="Tourville 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tourville|first=Jason|author2=Kevin Reilly |author3=Frank Guenther |title=Neural mechanisms underlying auditory feedback control of speech|journal=NeuroImage|date=1 February 2008|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1429–1443|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.054}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the person loses hearing ability later in life, most can still maintain a normal level of verbal intelligence. This is thought to be because of the brain's [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism still helping to fix [[speech error]]s, even in the absence of [[auditory feedback]].&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt;

===Written language===

====Generation====
{{Main|Writing}}
Generation of written language is thought to be closely related to speech generation, relying on [[Broca's area]] for early processing and on the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] for semantic processing.&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, writing differs in two major ways. First, instead of relating the thought to sounds, the brain must relate the thought to symbols or letters, and second, the [[motor cortex]] activates a different set of muscles to write, than when speaking.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Comprehension====
{{Main|Reading (process)|l1=Reading}}
Written comprehension, similar to spoken comprehension, seems to occur primarily in [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, instead of using the auditory system to gain language input, written comprehension relies on the visual system.

==Genetic links==
[[File:Protein NRXN1 PDB 1c4r.png|thumb|right|Protein NRXN1, which is created from the NRXN1 gene]]
While the capabilities of the physical structures used are large factors in determining linguistic intelligence, there have been several [[genes]] that have been linked to individual linguistic ability.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Adam|author2=Katalin Csiszar |title=Genetic insights into the functional elements of language|journal=Human Genetics|date=September 2013|volume=132|issue=9|pages=959–986|doi=10.1007/s00439-013-1317-0|pmid=23749164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NRXN1]] gene has been linked to general language ability, and [[mutation]]s of this gene has been shown to cause major issues to overall linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; The [[CNTNAP2]] gene is believed to affect [[language development]] and performance, and [[mutation]]s in this gene is thought to be involved in [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[PCDH11]] has been linked to language capacity, and it is believed to be one of the factors that accounts for the variation in linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

==Measurement and testing==
In general, it is difficult to test for linguistic intelligence as a whole, therefore verbal intelligence is often measured instead. This is done using various types of [[verbal fluency test]]s.&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CC 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casals-Coll|first=M. |author2=Sanchez-Benavides |author3=Quintana |author4=Manero |author5=Rognoni |author6=Calvo |author7=Palomo |author8=Aranciva |author9=Tamayo |author10=Pena-Casanova |title=Spanish normative studies in young adults (NEURONORMA young adults project): Normative data: norms for verbal fluency tests|journal=Neurologia|date=Jan–Feb 2013|volume=28|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.nrleng.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal fluency tests===
*[[Semantics|Semantic]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words in groups, such as animals, kitchen tools, fruits, etc. This type of test focuses on the subject's ability to generate words that have meaning to them. This test has been found to be sensitive to age.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Formal Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words given specific letter-based rules. This test has been found to be sensitive to education level.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Initial Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words starting with a specific letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Excluded Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words that do not contain a certain letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*[[Verb]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to list verbs. Subjects are then tested on their ability to use listed verbs.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Verbal Reproduction Test - Subjects are asked to listen to a [[monologue]]. They are then asked to repeat the monologue, and the subject is scored based on the number of words and [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]] used from the original monologue.&lt;ref name="FM 2012" /&gt;

===Verbal fluency in children===
In one series of tests, it was shown that when children were given verbal fluency tests, a larger portion of their [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] activated compared to adults, as well as activation of both the left and right hemispheres. This is most likely due to the high [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of newly developing brains.&lt;ref name="Gaillard 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaillard|first=W.D. |author2=Hertz-Pannier |author3=Mott |author4=Barnett |author5=LeBihan |author6=Theodore |title=Functional anatomy of cognitive development - fMRI of verbal fluency in children and adults|journal=Neurology|date=Jan 2000|volume=54|issue=1|pages=180–185|doi=10.1212/wnl.54.1.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible conflict===
Recently, a study was done showing that verbal fluency test results can differ depending on the mental focus of the subject. In this study, mental focus on physical [[speech production]] mechanisms caused speech production times to suffer, whereas mental focus on [[auditory feedback]] improved these times.&lt;ref name="Lisman 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lisman|first=Amanda|author2=Neeraja, Sadagopan |title=Focus of attention and speech motor performance|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=May–Jun 2013|volume=46|issue=3|pages=281–293|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2013.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders affecting linguistic intelligence==
{{Main|Speech-language pathology}}
Since linguistic intelligence is based on several complex skills, there are many disorders and injuries that can affect an individual's linguistic intelligence.

===Injuries===
Damage and injury in the brain can severely lower one's ability to communicate, and therefore lower one's linguistic intelligence. Common forms of major damage are [[strokes]], [[concussions]], [[brain tumor]]s, [[Virus|viral]]/[[bacteria]]l damage, and [[drug]]-related damage. The three major [[Language disorder|linguistic disorders]] that result from these injuries are [[aphasia]], [[alexia (condition)|alexia]], and [[agraphia]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Aphasia]] is the inability to speak, and can be caused by damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; Alexia is the inability to read, which can arise from damage to [[Wernicke's area]], among other places.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Agraphia]] is the inability to write which can also arise from damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; In addition, damage to large areas of the brain can result in any combinations of these disorders, as well as a loss of other abilities.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

===Pure language disorders===
There are several disorders that primarily affect only language skills. Three major pure language disorders are [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]], [[specific language impairment]], and [[stuttering]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]] (DVD) is a disorder where children have errors in consonant and vowel production.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Specific language impairment]] (SLI) is a disorder where the patient has a lack of [[language acquisition]] skills, despite a seemingly normal [[intelligence]] level in other areas.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Stuttering]] is a fairly common disorder where speech flow is interrupted by involuntary repetitions of [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

===Other disorders affecting language===
Some disorders cause a wide array of effects, and language impairment is merely one of many possible [[symptom]]s. The two major disorders of this type are  [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]] and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Autism]] and other [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) are disorders in which the patient suffers from decreased [[social skills]] and lowered [[Cognitive flexibility|mental flexibility]]. As a result, many patients suffering from ASDs also have language problems, arising from both the lack of social interaction and lowered mental flexibility.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Epilepsy]] is a disorder where electrical malfunctions or mis-communications in the brain cause [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], leading to muscle [[spasm]]s and activation of other organs and systems of the body. Over time, epilepsy can lead to cognitive and behavioral decay. This mental decay can eventually lead to a loss of language and communication skills.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

The '''Lithuanian press ban''' ({{lang-lt|spaudos draudimas}}) was a ban on all [[Lithuanian language]] publications printed in the [[Latin alphabet]] in force from 1865 to 1904 within the [[Russian Empire]], which controlled [[Lithuania]] at the time.  Lithuanian-language publications that used [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] were allowed and even encouraged. 

The concept arose after the failed [[January Uprising]] of 1863, taking the form of an administrative order in 1864, and was not lifted until 26 April 1904. The Russian courts reversed two convictions in press ban cases in 1902 and 1903, and the setbacks of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in early 1904 brought about a loosened Russian policy towards minorities.&lt;ref name=LTR_en&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/Lithuanian_Resistance.en.htm Lithuanian Resistance]. Spaudos.lt, reprinted from [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]], Boston, 1970-1978. Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the ban, it was illegal to print, import, distribute, or possess any publications in the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=lituanus3&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1996/96_3_03.htm Lithuania 1863-1893: Tsarist Russification And The Beginnings Of The Modern Lithuanian National Movement].

Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tsar]]ist authorities hoped that this measure, part of a larger [[Russification]] plan, would decrease Polish influence on Lithuanians and would return them to what were considered their ancient historical ties with Russia.&lt;ref name=geras/&gt; However, Lithuanians organized printing outside the Empire, largely in [[Lithuania Minor]] ([[East Prussia]]), and in the United States. 

[[Knygnešiai]] (Lithuanian book smugglers) smuggled illegal books and periodicals across the border. The number of such publications kept increasing despite strict sanctions and persecution of the activists. The ban created a well-defined and organized opposition to Russian rule and culture—the opposite of its original intent. The Lithuanian historian [[Edvardas Gudavičius]] has described the ban as a test of the concept of Lithuania: had there been no resistance, the language would have become a historical footnote, and the modern nation would never have been created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/1999-4/Gudavicius.pdf The Year 2000: History and Contemporary Experience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162352/http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/1999-4/Gudavicius.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}.

==Background==
[[File:Mazvydo katekizmas.jpg|right|150 px|thumb|[[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas]] published in 1547]]
The first book published in print in the Lithuanian language was [[Lutheran]] [[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas]] in 1547. Other milestone publications included [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]]'s ''Grammar'' in 1653, a publication of the [[Bible]] in 1735, and the first work of imaginative literature, [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]]' ''Metai'' ([[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]), in 1818.  During the years of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which lasted from 1569 to 1781, the [[Polish language]] gained ground as the written ''[[lingua franca]]'' of greater Lithuania, although the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] areas of [[Lithuania Minor]] continued to issue publications in Lithuanian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelviewpublications.net/cilp/003/0062/cilp0030062.pdf Locating Lithuanian in the (Re-) Intellectualisation Debate]. channelviewpublications.net.

At the beginning of the 19th century, use of the [[Lithuanian language]] was largely limited to Lithuanian rural areas, apart from its use in Prussia; it was, however, retained by some members of the minor nobility, especially in the [[Samogitia]]n region. Several factors contributed to its subsequent revival: the language drew attention from scholars of the emerging science of [[comparative linguistics]]; after the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire in 1861]], [[social mobility]] increased, and Lithuanian intellectuals arose from the ranks of the rural populace; and language became associated with identity in Lithuania, as elsewhere across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1989/89_4_06.htm The Lithuanian language and nation through the ages: Outline of a history of Lithuanian in its social context] William R.

A closer relationship developed between the educated clergy, who were increasingly of ethnic Lithuanian stock, and their parishioners, including a sympathy with their wish to use the Lithuanian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1988/88_3_02.htm Christianity in Lithuania].

After the [[partitions of Poland|partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the late 18th century, significant portions of Lithuania and Poland were incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]]. The uprising of 1863, seeking to re-establish the Commonwealth, convinced many Russian politicians that Polish cultural and political influence was the main obstacle hindering the Russification of Lithuania. They believed that if the Lithuanian peasantry were distanced from the [[Szlachta|Polonized nobility]] and the [[Catholic Church]], Lithuanians would naturally come under Russian cultural influence, as they had allegedly been during previous eras.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Simas Sužiedėlis |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] |title=Press ban |year=1970–1978 |publisher=Juozas Kapočius |volume=IV |location=Boston, Massachusetts |id={{LCC|74-114275}} |pages=342–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian politician Nikolai Miliutin wrote that "Russian letters will finish that which was begun with the Russian sword."&lt;ref name=schmalstieg1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1995_1/95_1_01.htm |title=Baudouin de Courtenay's Contribution to Lithuanian Linguistics |publisher=[[Lituanus]] |year=1995 |author=William R.

On 13 May 1863 Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] appointed [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky|Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov]] as the Governor General of the [[Vilna Governorate]].&lt;ref name=miknys/&gt; His duties included both suppression of the uprising, and implementation of the Russification policy. Because the situation was perceived as critical, Muravyov was temporarily granted extremely wide powers.&lt;ref name=le&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Lietuvių enciklopedija | title=Spaudos draudimas | location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher=Lietuvių enciklopedijos leidykla |year=1963 |volume=28 |pages=334–337 |id={{LCC|55020366}} |url=http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/SD_issamiau.htm|accessdate= 2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muravyov and [[Ivan Petrovich Kornilov]], the newly appointed director of the [[Vilnius]] educational district, prepared a radical long-term Russification program that became known as the ''Program of Restoration of Russian Beginnings'' ({{lang-lt|Rusų pradų atkūrimo programa}}). Its stated goals were to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lietuvos istorija 11–12 klasėms | first=Rūstis |last=Kamuntavičius |author2=Vaida Kamuntavičienė |author3=Remigijus Civinskas |author4=Kastytis Antanaitis  |year=2001 |publisher=Vaga |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-415-01502-7 |pages=303–304|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Eliminate the Polish language from public life
# Prevent the employment of Catholics in government institutions
# Control and restrict the Catholic Church
# Create favorable conditions for the spread of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]
# Replace Lithuanian parish schools with Russian grammar schools
# Encourage ethnic Russians to resettle in Lithuanian lands
# Replace the Latin alphabet with the Cyrillic alphabet
# Ban any Lithuanian-language publications in the Latin alphabet

On 22 May 1864 Tsar Alexander II approved this program.&lt;ref name=miknys&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/History_a.en.htm | first=Rimantas |last=Miknys | title=Acquaintance with Lithuania. Book of the Millennium |volume=I |location=Kaunas |publisher=[[Kraštotvarka]] |year=1999 |pages=68–74 |isbn=9986-892-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Muravyov issued an administrative order that forbade printing Lithuanian language textbooks written in the Latin alphabet. This order was developed into a comprehensive ban on September 6, 1865 by [[Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman]], Muravyov's successor.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; Kaufman issued an order to six neighboring governorates declaring a full ban on all publications and demanding that censorship committees enforce it without hesitation. A week later the order was extended to the entire Empire by [[Pyotr Valuev]], Minister of the Interior. In 1866 the ban was further extended to include all academic books.&lt;ref name=le/&gt;

Despite its strict and widespread enforcement, none of the ban's supporting measures were ever actually codified into law. The ban was enforced based solely on administrative orders and the tsar's approval.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; When the special temporary powers of the Governor General were revoked in 1871, these administrative orders lost any legal value. From that point on the ban had no legal basis, but it was still strictly enforced.&lt;ref name=le/&gt;

==Enforcement==
[[File:Edict of Alexander II in 1864.jpg|thumb|left|One of the first official edicts in Cyrillic alphabet, delivered by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]]]
[[File:19th C. sign in Lithuania.jpg|thumb|right|Speaking [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] strictly forbidden]]
At first the Russian authorities encouraged and sponsored the publication of Lithuanian-language works in the Cyrillic alphabet. The idea of replacing the Latin alphabet with Cyrillic was first elaborated by the well-known [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]] [[Alexander Hilferding]] in his 1863 book ''Lithuania and Samogitia''.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; &lt;!-- Vasili Kulin, an educational superintendent, argued that the administration should use all its means to support Orthodoxy as well, and that results could be expected within five years.{{Citation needed|date = March 2009}}   --&gt;

The first experiments with the conversion of Lithuanian writings into Cyrillic were conducted by a Lithuanian linguist, [[Jonas Juška]]. He showed some samples of adapted texts to both Muravyov and Kornilov in February 1864.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; However, Juška discontinued his work and Kornilov formed a committee to work on publishing Lithuanian books in Cyrillic. The committee had four members: the Polish librarian [[Stanisław Mikucki]] from [[Warsaw]], Russian Jonas Kerčinskis, a Lithuanian [[Catholic]] priest who had converted to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], Antanas Petkevičius, and the well-known Lithuanian educator and publisher [[Laurynas Ivinskis]].&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Ivinskis soon withdrew from the committee. The first such  book was a primer intended for use in the new Russian schools that were replacing the Lithuanian parish schools. It appeared during the summer of 1864. The committee also published a [[Breviary|prayer book]], a calendar, and other religious literature.

About 55 Lithuanian-Cyrillic titles were published during the 40 years of the ban; about half of these were published during its first decade.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Seeing that the Lithuanian people were unwilling to accept these books, even when they were offered for free, the Russian government shifted its attention to eliminating the illegal publications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The Russian Ministry of Education issued a report in May 1898 recommending that the press ban be repealed. The report stated that the ban had produced adverse and unforeseen results, including the development of Lithuanian nationalism. Other Russian officials had opined that the interests of the Russian state would be better served by the presence of a legal Lithuanian press that could be censored.&lt;ref name=LTR_en/&gt;

During the years of the ban, 3,047 people (829 [[knygnešiai|smugglers]], 859 distributors, and 1,359 persons possessing banned books) were arrested in connection with the ban.&lt;ref name=geras&gt;{{cite book | last=Jakštas | first=Juozas | editor=Ed.

Anti-Russian sentiment and distrust of the tsarist authorities had arisen after the 1863 revolt. The ban was also perceived as a threat to the Catholic Church; the Eastern Orthodox Church used the Cyrillic alphabet, and loyalty to the Latin alphabet was also a symbolic loyalty to Catholicism.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Attempts were made to circumvent the ban by using [[Blackletter|Gothic script]]. However, that was also banned in 1872. A number of problems arose with the various Lithuanian-Cyrillic orthographies, which were all criticized as ill-adapted to the Lithuanian language. Within Russia, the ban was opposed by scholarly, liberal, and pro-democratic groups, which served to mitigate the punishments.&lt;ref name=lituanus3/&gt;
[[File:List of confiscated Lithuanian books.jpg|thumb|right|List of confiscated Lithuanian books in 1896]]
The organized resistance to the ban, both legal and illegal, was largely initiated by bishop [[Motiejus Valančius]], who petitioned the government to exempt prayer books from the ban. He then moved towards sponsoring the [[Knygnešiai|illegal flow of books from outside Lithuania]]. The period from Valančius death in 1875 to 1883 saw the establishment of the Lithuanian-language newspaper ''[[Auszra]]'' (The Dawn), and the resistance at this time is associated with bishop [[Antanas Baranauskas]]. The resistance intensified towards the end of the 19th century, after another major newspaper, ''[[Varpas]]'' (The Bell), edited by [[Vincas Kudirka]], was established in 1889. Between 1891 and 1893, 31,718 publications were confiscated and destroyed; between 1900 and 1902 this number increased to 56,182, reflecting their increased flow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Knygnesiai/Knygnesys.en.htm Knygnešys/Booksmuggler]. The Lithuanian Word, Reprinted from the [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]], Boston, 1970-1978. Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from 1890 to 1904 saw the publication of about 2,500 book titles in the Lithuanian Latin alphabet.  The majority of these were published in [[Tilsit]], a city in [[East Prussia]], although some publications reached Lithuania from the [[United States]]. A largely standardized written version of the language was achieved by the turn of the twentieth century, based on historical and [[Aukštaitija]]n (highland) usages;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lki.lt/index.php?test=206] Lithuanian Language Institute Abstracts.&lt;/ref&gt; the letters -č- and -š- were taken from [[Czech language|Czech]] orthography.&lt;ref name=gied&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/classes/lith/lith410/SUB_2004_double_orthography_SCHMA.pdf Double Orthography in American Lithuanian Newspapers at the Turn of the Twentieth Century].

A number of challenges to the ban's legal basis were made, and the use of this venue intensified at the end of the 19th century, along with an increasing number of letters, petitions, and protests from Lithuanians. In 1902 and 1903 the Russian Supreme Court reversed two press ban convictions that had been brought against Antanas Macijauskas and [[Povilas Višinskis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Awakening Lithuania |first=Jack J. |last=Stukas | publisher=The Florham Park Press | year=1966 |id={{LCC|66-28716}} |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decisions stated that the original executive decree creating the ban was illegal. The outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in February 1904 contributed to the Russian government's perception that its minorities needed to be accommodated.&lt;ref name=LTR_en/&gt; The ban was officially lifted on 26 April 1904.&lt;ref name=ltword/&gt;

==Effect on education==

Public and private education in Lithuanian was adversely affected by the press ban. The level of pent-up demand for schooling in the 19th century is illustrated by the increase in literacy in the [[Rietavas]] area; between 1853 and 1863, just before the ban, the number of literate persons rose from 11,296 to 24,330.&lt;ref name="lituanus3"/&gt; The subsequent ban is thought to have contributed to [[illiteracy]] in 19th-century Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/2004/04_4_2Markelis.htm Talking Through Letters - Collaborative Writing in Early Lithuanian Immigrant Life]. [[Lituanus]], Winter 2004. Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the ruling, parish schools were closed. A shortage of teachers led to the closure of a number of state schools as well, in spite of population growth. Parents began to withdraw their children from the state schools, since they were associated with the policy of Russification; students were not allowed to speak Lithuanian among themselves, and a discouraging atmosphere was created by the system of searches, inspections, and spying. Many students were schooled at home or in small secret groups instead, although this practice also resulted in sanctions.&lt;ref name=lituanus3/&gt;

A census of the [[Kovno Governorate]] in 1897 showed that a higher proportion of older people than younger had received formal education: of persons age 30 to 39, 61.87% had experienced some level of formal education, compared to only 54.68% of persons aged 10 to 19.&lt;ref name="lituanus3"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Proclamation of 1904.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Lithuanian proclamation after press ban lift, title reads ''Press is allowed!'' (1904)]]
After the ban was lifted, printing presses and their supporting social and cultural infrastructure needed to be established. The first issue of a Lithuanian newspaper after the ban, ''[[Vilniaus žinios]]'', appeared on December 23, 1904; the [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]], which took place in November 1905, was now able to issue its announcements and publications in Lithuanian.

The publishing houses of Martynas Kukta, [[Saliamonas Banaitis]], and the Society of [[St. Casimir]] in [[Kaunas]] were responsible for many of the publications issued between the end of the ban in 1904 and the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1918. The businessman [[Petras Vileišis]] installed a printing press at his [[Vileišis Palace|palace]], commissioned in 1904. During this period 4,734 Lithuanian-language titles in the Latin alphabet were published in Lithuania and abroad. After Lithuanian independence was established, the rate of publication increased steadily; 16,721 book titles were printed from 1918 to 1939. Between 1925 and 1939 about 800 to 900 book titles were printed annually.&lt;ref name=ltword/&gt;

A standard Lithuanian orthography and grammar were established during the ban, despite the fact that the co-ordination of this process, involving competing dialects, was forced to take place in several countries. The ban is widely felt to have stimulated the Lithuanian national movement, rather than discouraging it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lithuania/History#toc37338 |title=Lithuania - History - Russian Rule |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the 100th anniversary of the ban's end was noted in [[UNESCO]]'s events calendar, and the Lithuanian [[Seimas]] declared the "Year of the Lithuanian Language and Book." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Knygnesiai/Lithuanian_Preserve.en.htm Preserving the Language].

An '''object language''' is a [[language]] which is the "object" of study in various fields including [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]].  The language being used to talk about an object language is called a [[metalanguage]].  An object language may be a [[formal language|formal]] or [[natural language|natural]] language.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Forms of object language ==
=== Formal languages ===

[[Mathematical logic]] and [[linguistics]] make use of metalanguages, which are languages for describing the nature of other languages. In mathematical logic, the object language is usually a [[formal language]]. The language which a metalanguage is used to describe is the object language. It is called that because that language is the object under discussion using the metalanguage.

For instance, someone who says "In French, you say ''Bonjour'' to greet someone" uses [[English language|English]] as a metalanguage to describe the object language [[French language|French]].

=== Computer languages ===

There are two ways the term ''object language'' can be used in computing: a language which is the object of formal specification, and a language which is the object (goal) of a compiler or interpreter.

==== Formal specification ====

{{Main|Specification language}}

Computer languages are object languages of the metalanguage in which their [[specification]] is written. In computer science this is referred to as the [[specification language]]. [[Backus–Naur form]] was one of the earliest used specification languages.

When [[compiler]]s are written using systems like [[lex (software)|lex]] and [[yacc]], the rules the programmer writes look much like a formal specification, but it is considered an [[implementation]] instead. Many [[programming language implementation]]s are not strictly the same as their specifications, adding features or making implementation-dependent design decisions.

==== Object Code ====

{{Main|Object file}}

At their basic level, computers act on what is given to them through a limited set of instructions which are understood by their [[CPU]]s. In the earliest computers, that meant programmers sometimes composed actual 1's and 0's to program. Since this requires considerable programmer training (and patience) to create instructions, later computer languages have gone to great lengths to simplify the programmer's task. For example, a high level programming language may allow a programmer to assign a value to a variable without specifying a memory location or a CPU instruction.

In this context, the high level programming language is the ''source language'', which is then translated by a [[compiler]] into [[object code]] that the CPU can read directly. This object code is the ''object language'', and varies depending on what CPU is being given the instructions.

''Object language'' in this context means something akin to "the object of what the programmer is trying to achieve". If the source language and object languages are viewed as formal (logical) languages, what the compiler does is ''interpret'' the source into the target language (this is different from the computer science use of ''[[interpreted language]]'' meaning one which is ''not'' compiled).

''Object language'' in this context is synonymous with ''target language''.  The object language of a translation most often is a [[machine language]], but can be some other kind of language, such as [[assembly language]].

Because the object language of compilation has usually been machine language, the term ''[[object file]]'' has come to mean a file containing machine instructions, and sometimes the translated program itself is simply called an ''object''.

''Object language'' should also not be confused with ''[[object-oriented language]]'', which is a type of computer [[programming language]] which changes the programmer's environment into convenient objects which can be used in something similar to a drag-and-drop fashion.

== Expressions in an object language ==
=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Symbol (formal)}}

A ''symbol'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]], [[type-token distinction|token]]s of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Although the term "symbol" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the [[formal language]]s studied in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the term "symbol" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a [[type-token distinction|token]] instance of the symbol.

=== Formulas ===
{{Main|Well-formed formula}}

In the formal languages used in mathematical logic and computer science, a ''well-formed formula'' or simply ''formula'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]] which is expressed using the [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s and [[formation rule]]s (also called the [[formal grammar]]) of a particular formal language. To say that a [[string (computer science)|string]] of symbols &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a well-formed formula with respect to a given formal grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to saying that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the language generated by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Formal systems ===
{{Main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' is a [[formal language]] together with a [[deductive system]] which consists of a set of [[inference rule]]s and/or [[axiom]]s. A formal system is used to [[formal proof|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions previously expressed in the system. These expressions are called [[axiom]]s, in the case of those previously supposed to be true, or [[theorem]]s, in the case of those derived. A formal system may be formulated and studied for its intrinsic properties, or it may be intended as a description (i.e. a [[Interpretation (logic)|model]]) of external phenomena.

=== Theorems ===
{{Main|Theorem}}

A ''theorem'' is a [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] or string of symbols which is [[formal proof|derived]] by using a [[formal system]]. The string of symbols is a [[logical consequence]] of the [[axiom]]s and [[rule of inference|rules]] of the system.

=== Formal proofs ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

A ''formal proof'' or ''derivation'' is a finite sequence of [[proposition]]s (called [[well-formed formula]]s in the case of a [[formal language]]) each of which is an [[axiom]] or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. The last sentence in the sequence is a [[theorem]] of a [[formal system]]. The concept of [[natural deduction]] is a [[generalization]] of the concept of proof.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]], ''deduction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theories ===
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

A ''theory'' is a set of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s in a [[formal language]].

[[File:Matura (oral part) - during exam 5.jpg|thumb|230px|An oral exam in the Czech Republic.]]

The '''oral exam''' (also '''oral test''' or '''''{{lang|la|viva voce}}'''''; '''''{{lang|de|Rigorosum}}''''' in [[German language|German-speaking]] nations) is a practice in many schools and disciplines in which an examiner poses questions to the student in spoken form. The student has to answer the question in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the subject to pass the exam. The oral exam also helps reduce (although it does not eliminate) the [[academic fraud|risk of granting a degree]] to a candidate who has had the thesis or dissertation [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by an expert.

==Overview==
Many science programs require students pursuing a [[bachelor's degree]] to finish the program by taking an oral exam or a combination of oral and written exams to show how well a student has understood the material studied in the program. Usually, study guides or a syllabus are made available so that the students may prepare for the exam by reviewing practice questions and topics likely to be on the exam.  There is a small but growing body of literature on the use of oral examinations in undergraduate education in the English speaking world. 

Some [[medical school]]s use oral exams for second and third year students to test knowledge but also the ability to respond on the spot. Students are required to take an oral exam prior to being awarded a [[PhD]]. Some universities allow the option of either taking written and oral exams or completing a [[project]] or [[thesis]], but occasionally, all three are required for graduation. Oral exams are distinct from a defense of a thesis in that the questions in the latter are more narrow and specific to the topic of the thesis.

[[Graduate student]]s are sometimes allowed to choose their examiners for oral exams.

Sometimes, the oral exam is offered in schools as an alternative to a written exam for students with a [[learning disability]], like [[dysgraphia]], [[developmental coordination disorder]], or [[non-verbal learning disorder]]. Often parents of the students have to request that the oral exam be given to their child in lieu of the written exam.

A [[Private pilot licence|Private Pilot Oral Exam]] is also required as part of the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] and [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]] practical test for prospective pilots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr483zBbQKw Private Pilot Oral Exam on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; An oral exam is also carried out by the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] in the [[UK]] for the purpose of issuing certificate of competencies for [[Merchant Navy]] deck and engine officers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-uk-seafarer-coc-deck-and-engineer-officers Application for UK COC Oral Exam]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''viva voce'' is a component of music diploma examinations administered by [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music|ABRSM]], [[Trinity College of Music]] and [[London College of Music]]. Candidates are posed a series of questions by the examiner about their chosen pieces, the composer and musical era. Depending on exam board, candidates may also be required to do a short writeup on their pieces.

'''Orality''' is [[thought]] and verbal expression in societies where the technologies of [[literacy]] (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.  The study of orality is closely allied to the study of [[oral tradition]].  

The term “orality” has been used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a generalised fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. 

[[Walter J. Ong]]’s work was foundational for the study of orality, and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and  the basic orality of language is permanent.{{sfn|Cronin|Crosson|Eastlake|2009|p=5}} 

In his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: 'primary orality' and 'secondary orality'. Primary orality is thought and expression un-touched by the culture of writing of print; ''[[secondary orality]]'' is explained by Ong as oral culture defined by (implicitly influenced) by the written and printed word, and includes oral culture made possible by technology such as a [[newscaster]] reading a news report on television.

In addition, 'residual orality' is also defined - it is the remnants, legacy, or influence of a predominately oral culture carried over into the written realm - an example might include the use of [[dialogue]] as a philosophical or didactic tool in written literature, such as used by the Greek thinker [[Plato]].

== Origins of philosophy and definition  ==

===Impact of literacy on culture===
Before writing became a way for many [[cultures]] before we had orality. Unfortunately many of the retained orality has been lost or drastically changed. Those that were able to be preserved gives us insight to past cultures and just how much we have evolved since then.&lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Orality and Literacy'' (2nd ed. {{harvnb|Ong|2002}}), Ong sums up his own work over the previous three decades as well as the work of numerous other scholars. With regard to oral tradition and primary orality he  draws on pioneering work by [[Milman Parry]], [[Albert B. Lord]], and [[Eric A. Havelock]]. [[Marshall McLuhan]] was among the first to fully appreciate the significance of the Ong's earlier work about print culture and the [[written and printed word]] as a [[technology]].  In his work ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' {{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}} McLuhan quotes and discusses works by Ong in the 1950s regarding print culture.{{sfn|McLuhan|1962|pp= 104, 129, 146, 159–60, 162–63, 168, 174–76}}; Orality gave us the stepping stones that allowed us to get where we are today, it was a necessity for the growth of civilization. &lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the [[history of communication]] – from the invention of speech (primary orality), to [[pictograms]],  to the [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]], to [[typography]], to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.

===Primary orality===
'Primary orality' refers to thought and its verbal expression within cultures "totally untouched by any knowledge of [[writing]] or [[Printing|print]]."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=11}}

All [[sound]] is inherently powerful. If a hunter kills a lion he can see it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because the sound of the lion signals its presence and its power. [[Speech communication|Speech]] is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p= 32}}

Writing is powerful in a different way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and the [[institution]]s that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas over a long period of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using [[mnemonic]] tools.

In his studies of the [[Homeric Question]], [[Milman Parry]] was able to show that the poetic metre found in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' had been 'packaged' by oral [[Greece|Greek]] society to meet its information management needs. These insights first opened the door to a wider appreciation of the sophistication of [[oral tradition]]s, and their various methods of managing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first = Adam | editor-last = Parry | title = The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry | publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford| year = 1971|page = 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ancient and medieval mnemonic tools were extensively documented by [[Frances Yates]] in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]''.{{harv|Yates|1966}}

===Residual orality===
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Socrates in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', quoting the prophecy of [[Amun|Ammon]] (Thamus) : ''"[Writing] will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. [..] You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.."'' (trans. H.N. Fowler; Line 275)]]
‘Residual orality’ refers to thought and its verbal expression in cultures that have been exposed to writing and print, but have not fully ‘interiorized’ (in McLuhan’s term) the use of these technologies in their daily lives.  As a culture interiorizes the technologies of literacy, the ‘oral residue’ diminishes.

But the availability of a technology of literacy to a society is not enough to ensure its widespread diffusion and use.  For example, [[Eric Havelock]] observed in ''A Preface to Plato'' that after the [[ancient Greeks]] invented writing they adopted a [[scribe|scribal]] culture that lasted for generations.  Few people, other than the scribes, considered it necessary to learn to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Havelock | first = Eric A.| title = A Preface to Plato | publisher =  Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts| year =1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other societies, such as [[ancient Egypt]] or [[medieval Europe]], literacy has been a domain confined to political and religious elites.

Many cultures have experienced an equilibrium state in which writing and mass illiteracy have co-existed for hundreds or even thousands of years.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp= 92–93}}

Oral residue rarely disappears quickly and never vanishes completely.  [[Speech communication|Speech]] is inherently an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts.  Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly shown in the arguments of [[Socrates]] against writing in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''.  Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman.  It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the [[human mind]] into mere objects in the physical world.  By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what they are able to think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory.  True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds.  And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same thing over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=78–79}}

The Canadian communications scholar, [[Harold Innis]] argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece in Plato's time. Plato conveyed his ideas by writing down the conversations of Socrates thus "preserving the power of the spoken word on the written page." [[Aristotle]], Innis wrote, regarded Plato's style as "halfway between poetry and prose." Plato was able to arrive at new philosophical positions "through the use of dialogues, allegories and illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harold | first = Innis | title = Empire and Communications | location= Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press | year = 1950 | pages = 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as McLuhan emphasizes, modernization attenuates some oral capabilities.  For example, in medieval Europe silent reading was largely unknown.  This tilted the readers' attention towards the poetic and other auditory aspects of the text.  Educated modern adults may also occasionally long for something like "the capacious medieval memory, which, untrammeled by the associations of print, could learn a strange language with ease and by the methods of a child, and could retain in memory and reproduce lengthy epic and elaborate lyric poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=McLuhan|edition=1962| first=H.J. | last =Chaytor | title = From Script to Print|publisher=  Heffer and Sons|location= Cambridge| year= 1945| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLuhan and Ong also document the apparent re-emergence, in the electronic age, of a kind of '[[secondary orality]]' that displaces written words with audio/visual technologies like [[radio]], [[telephones]], and [[television]].  Unlike primary oral modes of communication, these technologies depend on print for their existence.  Mass Internet collaborations, such as Wikipedia, rely primarily on writing, but re-introduce relationships and responsiveness into the text.

===Importance of the concept===
:''For more details on the social, economic and other effects of literacy or illiteracy see [[Literacy]]''
It has been a habit of literate cultures to view oral cultures simply in terms of their lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmonson, Monro E.|title=Lore: An Introduction to the Science of Folklore and Literature|publisher= Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|location= New York|date= 1971|pages= 323, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; While literacy extends human possibilities in both thought and action, all literate technologies ultimately depend on the ability of humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.

Understanding between nations may depend to some degree on understanding oral culture. Ong argues that "many of the contrasts often made between 'western' and other views seem reducible to contrasts between deeply interiorized literacy and more or less residually oral states of consciousness."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=29}}

==Theory of the characteristics of oral culture==
Drawing on hundreds of studies from [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]] and the study of [[oral tradition]], Ong summarizes ten key aspects of the '[[psychodynamics]] of orality'. While these are subject to continuing debate, his list remains an important milestone. Ong draws his examples from both primary oral societies, and societies with a very high 'oral residue'.

===Formulaic styling===
To retain complex ideas requires that they be packaged memorably for easy recall.

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| To solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence. Your thoughts must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or antithesis, in alliterations or assonances, in epithetic and other formulary expressions… Serious thought is intertwined with memory systems.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=34}}
|}

Anthropologist [[Marcel Jousse]] identifies a close linkage between [[rhythm]] and breathing patterns, gestures and the bilateral symmetry of the human body in several ancient verse traditions.{{sfn|Ong|2002|loc=p.34 citing {{harv|Jousse|1978}} }} This synergy between the body and the construction of oral thought further fuels memory.

===Additive rather than subordinative===
Oral cultures avoid complex 'subordinative' clauses. Ong cites an example from the [[Douay-Rheims]] version of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (1609–10), noting that this basic additive pattern (in ''italics'') has been identified in many oral contexts around the world:{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=37}}

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning God created heaven and earth. ''And'' the earth was void and empty, ''and'' darkness was on the face of the deep; ''and'' the spirit of God moved over the waters. ''And'' God said …
|}

Demonstrating how oral modes of communication tend to evolve into literate ones, Ong additionally cites the [[New American Bible]] (1970), which offers a translation that is grammatically far more complex:

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. Then God said …
|}

===Aggregative rather than analytic===
Oral expression brings words together in pithy phrases that are the product of generations of evolution: the 'sturdy oak tree', the 'beautiful princess' or 'clever Odysseus'. This does not apply specifically to [[poetry]] or [[song]]; rather the words are brought together out of habit during general communication. 'Analyzing' or breaking apart such expressions is risky: they represent the work of generations and "there is nowhere outside the mind to store them."

Ong cites an American example, noting that in some parts of the [[United States]] with heavy oral residue, until the early twentieth-century it was still considered normal or even obligatory to use the adjective ‘glorious’ when referring to the '[[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]'.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=39}}

===Redundant or 'copious'===
Speech that repeats earlier thoughts or thought-pictures, or shines a different light on them somehow, helps to keep both the speaker and the listener focused on the topic, and makes it easier for all to recall the key points later. "Oral cultures encourage fluency, fulsomeness, volubility. Rhetoricians were to call this [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]]"{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=40}}

===Conservative or traditionalist===
Because oral societies have no effective access to writing and print technologies, they must invest considerable energy in basic [[information management]]. Storage of information, being primarily dependent on individual or collective recall, must be handled with particular thrift. It is possible to approximately measure oral residue "from the amount of memorization the culture's educational procedures require."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first =Jack|editor-last =  Goody| at = introduction, pp.13-14 | title = Literacy in traditional societies | publisher =  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge | year = 1968  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This creates incentives to avoid exploring new ideas and particularly to avoid the burden of having to store them. It does not prevent oral societies from demonstrating dynamism and change, but there is a premium on ensuring that changes cleave to traditional formulas, and "are presented as fitting the traditions of the ancestors."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=42}}

===Close to the human lifeworld===
Oral cultures take a practical approach to information storage. To qualify for storage, information must usually concern matters of immediate practical concern or familiarity to most members of the society.

Long after the invention of writing, and often long after the invention of print, basic information on how to perform a society’s most important trades was left unwritten, passed from one generation to the next as it always had been: through [[apprenticeship]], observation and practice.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=43}}

By contrast, only literary cultures have launched phenomenological analyses, abstract classifications, ordered lists and tables, etc. Nothing analogous exists in oral societies.

===Agonistically toned===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|left|thumb|Beowulf fights the dragon: the oral world is agonistic]]
'Agonistic' means 'combative', but Ong actually advances a deeper thesis with this point. Writing and to an even greater extent print, he argues, disengage humans from direct, interpersonal struggle.

Products of "the highly polarized, agonistic, oral world of good and evil, virtue and vice, villains and heroes," the great works of [[oral literature]] from [[Homer]] to [[Beowulf]], from the [[Mwindo epic]] to the [[Old Testament]], are extremely violent by modern standards. They are also punctuated by frequent and intense intellectual combat and tongue-lashings on the one hand, and effusive praise (perhaps reaching its height among [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[griot|praise singers]]) on the other.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=43–45}}

===Empathetic and participatory===
In an oral culture the most reliable and trusted technique for learning is to share a "close, empathetic, communal association" with others who know.

Ong cites a study of community decision-making from 12th Century [[England]]. Writing already had a long history in England, and it would have been possible to use texts to establish for example, the age of majority of the heir to an estate. But people were skeptical about texts, noting not only the cost of generating and managing them, but the problems involved in preventing tampering or frauds.

As a result, they retained the traditional solution: gathering together "mature wise seniors of many years, having good testimony", and publicly discussing the age of the heir with them, until agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = M.T. |last = Clanchy | title = From Memory to Written Record, England 1066–1307 | publisher =  Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts | year =  1979 | pages = 230–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hallmark principle of orality, that truth emerges best from communal process, resonates today in the [[jury]] system.

===Homeostatic===
Oral societies conserve their limited capacity to store information, and retain the relevance of their information to the interest of their present members, by shedding memories that have lost their past significance.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|pp=31–34}}

While many examples exist, the classic example was reported by {{harvnb|Goody|Watt|1968}}. Written records prepared by the British in [[Ghana]] in the early 1900s show that [[Ndewura Jakpa]], the seventeenth century founder of the state of the [[Gonja people]], had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|p=33}} Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.

===Situational rather than abstract===
In oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker. A study by [[Alexander Luria]], a psychologist who did extensive fieldwork comparing oral and literate subjects in remote areas of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kirghizia]] in 1931–2&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Aleksandr Romanovich | last = Luria | title = Cognitive Development: Its Social and Cultural Foundations| editor-first = Michael |editor-last = Cole| translator-first =Martin | translator-last = Lopez-Morillas |translator-first2 = Lynn | translator-last2= Solotaroff |publisher = Harvard University Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London| year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented the highly situational nature of oral thinking.

* Oral subjects always used real objects they were familiar with to refer to geometric shapes; for example a plate or the moon might be used to refer to a circle.
* Asked to select three similar words from the following list "hammer, saw, log, hatchet", oral subjects would reject the literate solution (removing the log to produce a list of 3 tools), pointing out that without the log there wasn't much use for the tools.
* Oral subjects took a practical, not an abstract, approach to syllogisms. Luria asked them this question. ''In the far north, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is always snow there. What colour are the bears?'' Typical response: "I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others. … Every locality has its own animals."
* Oral subjects proved unwilling to analyze themselves. When asked "what sort of person are you?" one responded: "What can I say about my own heart? How can I talk about my character? Ask others; they can tell you about me. I myself can’t say anything."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=49–54}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6100">A '''pseudoword''' or '''non-word''' is a unit of speech or text that appears to be an actual word in a certain [[language]], while in fact it has no meaning in the [[lexicon]]. It is a kind of non-lexical [[vocable]].

Such [[word]]s without a [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a certain language or no occurrence in any [[text corpus]] or [[dictionary]] can be the result of (the interpretation of) a truly [[random signal]], there will usually be an underlying deterministic source as is the case for:

*[[nonsense word]]s (e.g. ''[[jabberwocky]]'')
*[[nonce word]]s
*[[ghost word]]s (e.g. ''[[dord]]'')
*[[Cipher|cyphers]]
*[[typo]]s

When nonsensical words are strung together, [[gibberish]] may arise. [[Word salad]] in contrast may contain legible and intelligible words but without semantic or [[syntax|syntactic]] correlation or [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]].

== Characteristics ==
{{No footnotes|section|date=April 2013}}
Within [[linguistics]], a pseudoword is defined specifically as respecting the [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] restrictions of a language. That is, it does not include sounds or series of sounds that do not exist in that language: it is easily pronounceable for speakers of the language. Also, when written down, a pseudoword does not include strings of characters that are not permissible in the spelling of the target language. "Vonk" is a pseudoword in English, while "dfhnxd" is not. The latter is an example of a nonword. Nonwords are contrasted with pseudowords in that they are not pronounceable and by that their spelling could not be the spelling of a real word.

Pseudowords are also sometimes called '''wug words''' in the context of linguistic experiments. This is because ''wug'' [wʌg] was one such pseudoword used by [[Jean Berko Gleason]] in her [[wug test]] 1958 experiments. Words like ''wug'', which could have been a perfectly acceptable word in English but isn't due to an [[accidental gap]], were presented to children. The experimenter would then prompt the children to create a plural for ''wug'', which was almost invariably ''wugs'' [wʌgz]. The experiments were designed to see if English [[morphophonemics]] would be applied by children to novel words. They revealed that even at a very young age, children have already internalized many of the complex features of their language.

A '''logatome''' is a short pseudoword or just a syllable which is used in acoustic experiments to examine [[speech recognition]].

== Nonsense syllables ==

A '''logatome''' or '''nonsense syllable''' is a short pseudoword consisting most of the time of just one [[syllable]] which has no meaning of its own. Examples of English logatomes are the nonsense words ''snarp'' or ''bluck''.

Like other pseudowords, logatomes obey all the phonotactic rules of a specific language.

Logatomes are used in particular in [[acoustics|acoustic]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=57–64 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-997389 |title=Sprachaudiometrie mit Logatomen* |year=2008 |last1=Welge-Lüßen |first1=Antje |last2=Hauser |first2=R. |last3=Erdmann |first3=J. |last4=Schwob |first4=Ch. |last5=Probst |first5=R. |journal=Laryngo-Rhino-Otologie |volume=76 |issue=02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in experiments in the [[psychology of learning]] as a way to examine speech recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.specom.2007.01.009 |title=Reaching over the gap: A review of efforts to link human and automatic speech recognition research |year=2007 |last1=Scharenborg |first1=O |journal=Speech Communication |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=336–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[experimental psychology]], especially the psychology of learning and [[memory]].

Nonsense syllables were first introduced by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]]&lt;ref&gt;Ebbinghaus, H. (1964).  ''Memory''. New York: Dover. (Originally published 1885.)&lt;/ref&gt; in his experiments on the learning of lists.  His intention was that they would form a standard stimulus so that experiments would be reproducible.  However, with increasing use it became apparent that different nonsense syllables were learned at very different rates, even when they had the same superficial structure.  Glaze&lt;ref&gt;Glaze, J. A. (1928).  The association value of non-sense syllables.  ''Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, 35'', 255-269.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of [[association value]] to describe these differences, which turned out to be reliable between people and situations.  Since Glaze's time, experiments using nonsense syllables typically control association value in order to reduce variability in results between stimuli.

Nonsense syllables can vary in structure.  The most used are the so-called CVC syllables, composed of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant.  These have the advantage that nearly all are pronounceable, that is, they fit the phonotactics of any language that uses [[syllable#Coda|closed syllables]], such as English and [[German language|German]].  They are often described as "CVC [[trigram]]s", reflecting their three-letter structure.  Obviously many other structures are possible, and can be described on the same principles, e.g. VC, VCV, CVCV.  But the CVC trigrams have been studied most intensively; for example, Glaze determined association values for 2019 of them.

The term nonsense syllable is widely used to describe [[non-lexical vocables in music|non-lexical vocables used in music]], most notably in [[scat singing]] but also in many other forms of vocal music.  Although such usages do not invoke the technical issues about structure and associability that are of concern in psychology, the essential meaning of the term is the same.

'''Semiotics of culture''' is a research field within [[semiotics]] that attempts to define [[culture]] from semiotic perspective and as a type of human symbolic activity, creation of [[sign]]s and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a [[system]] of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as '''semiotics of culture and language'''. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.

The research field was of particular interest for the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]] ([[USSR]]). Linguists and semioticians by the Tartu School viewed culture as a hierarchical semiotic system consisting of set of functions correlated to it, and linguistic codes that are used by social groups to maintain coherence. These codes are viewed as superstructures based on natural language, and here the ability of humans to symbolize is central.

The study received a research ground also in [[Japan]] where the idea that culture and nature should not be contrasted and contradicted but rather harmonized was developed.

[[File:Anger during a protest by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|Two people in a shouting match over religion]]
A '''shouting match''' is an [[argument]] or [[debate]] characterized by the loud volume or intensity of the participants.

==Parliamentary procedures==
Large assemblies may easily degenerate into shouting matches as the participants raise their voices just in order to be heard.  To control this tendency towards chaos, rules of conduct such as [[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules]] are often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 391-394}}"Decorum in Debate"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productive confrontation==
Some assemblies may choose this form of discourse deliberately so that creative contributions are not stifled by formal rules.  The [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] working parties to establish a definitive new reference work for [[mathematic]]s were conducted in this way, being described as “''Two or three monologues shouted at top voice, seemingly independently of one another''” by [[Armand Borel]], who attributed the success of this process to the commitment and hard work of the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199803/borel.pdf|format=PDF|title=Twenty-Five Years with Nicolas Bourbaki, 1949–1973|author=Armand Borel|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[General Electric]] company, the successful chief executive, [[Jack Welch]], forced his managers to justify their positions by intensive argument that often became shouting matches.  The result was to make the management confront reality and motivate them to make their proposals work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pages=341–2|title=General Electric: Life After Jack|author=RM Grant|publisher=Blackwell|url=https://www.blackwellpublishing.com/grant/docs/16GE.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123020734/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/grant/docs/16GE.pdf|archivedate=2009-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In commerce==
Shouting matches should be avoided in commercial interactions between customers and suppliers because they tend to poison relations between the parties and so reduce the possibility of a productive deal.  Training and role-playing may be used to develop the [[emotional intelligence]] required to handle such situations effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Emotional intelligence – training people to be affective so they can be effective|author=Mike Bagshaw|journal=Industrial and Commercial Training|year=2000|volume=32|issue=2|pages=61–65|issn=0019-7858|doi=10.1108/00197850010320699|publisher=MCB UP Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In public situations such as a nightclub or bar, staff that get into shouting matches with patrons look badly unprofessional.  If they instead ignore the insults, the intoxicated customers will get frustrated and leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=St5L-UYiPD8C|title=The Nightclub, Bar and Restaurant Security Handbook|author=Robert McManus, Sean O'Toole|isbn=978-0-9647209-0-9|year=1995|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online==
Online communication in internet forums commonly takes the form of a shouting match, sometimes using ALL CAPS to denote shouting.  This is due to the anonymity which reduces the possibility of sanction for intemperate speech.  So, rather than a listening and rational exchange, the format fosters rage and aggression which results in extreme opinions and insults.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKqDnulJqDsC|pages=104–5|title=Crime and Punishment in Contemporary Culture|author=Claire Valier|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-28175-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As social ritual==
The [[Yanomamo]] people of the [[Orinoco]] are known as ''The Fierce People''.  When two tribes meet for a feast, their chiefs start by engaging in a ritualised shouting match in which they ostensibly engage in fierce conflict but, by their rhythmic interaction, establish a satisfying bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_prAAAAMAAJ|pages=255|title=Emotions and Psychopathology|author=Manfred Clynes, Jaak Panksepp|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-306-42916-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pages=30|title=The Silent Pulse: A Search for the Perfect Rhythm That Exists in Each of Us|author=George Leonard|publisher=Gibbs Smith|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4236-0122-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_F0hhN3IrAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Small talk''' is an informal type of [[discourse]] that does not cover any functional topics of [[conversation]] or any transactions that need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-master-the-art-of-small-talk.html How to Master the Art of Small Talk – For Dummies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of small talk was initially{{cn|date=September 2018}} studied in 1923 by [[Bronisław Malinowski]], who coined the term "[[phatic]] communication" to describe it.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, B. (1923) "The problem of meaning in primitive languages", in: Ogden, C. &amp; Richards, I., ''The Meaning of Meaning'', Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to conduct small talk is a [[social skill]]; hence, small talk is some type of [[social communication]].

== Purpose ==
In spite of seeming to have little useful purpose, small talk is a [[Human bonding|bonding]] ritual and a strategy for managing [[Personal distance|interpersonal distance]].&lt;ref&gt;Bickmore, T. (1999) ''A Computational Model of Small Talk'', accessed online at 
[https://web.archive.org/web/20020117153358/http://web.media.mit.edu/~bickmore/Mas962b/ media.mit.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; It serves many functions in helping to define the relationships between friends, colleagues, and new acquaintances. In particular, it helps new acquaintances to explore and categorize each other's [[social position]].&lt;ref&gt;Laver, J. (1975), "Communicative Functions of Phatic Communion", in: Kendon, A. / Harris, R. / Key, M. (eds.), ''The Organisation of Behaviour in Face-to-Face Interaction'', pp.215–238, The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; Small talk is closely related to the need for people to maintain positive [[Face (self image)|face]] and feel approved of by those who are listening to them. It lubricates social interactions in a very flexible way, but the desired function is often dependent on the point in the conversation at which the small talk occurs:&lt;ref name="holmeszerozero"&gt;Holmes, J. (2000) "Doing collegiality and keeping control at work: small talk in government departments", in: J. Coupland, (ed.) ''Small Talk'', Pearson, Harlow UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Conversation opener]]: when the speakers do not know each other, it allows them to show that they have friendly intentions and desire some sort of positive interaction. In a business meeting, it enables people to establish each other's reputation and level of expertise. If there is already a relationship between the two talkers, their small talk serves as a gentle introduction before engaging in more functional topics of conversation. It allows them to signal their own [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and to sense the mood of the other person.
# At the end of a conversation: suddenly ending an exchange may risk appearing to [[Social rejection|reject]] the other person. Small talk can be used to mitigate that rejection, affirm the relationship between the two people, and soften the parting.
# Space filler to avoid [[silence]]: in many cultures, silences between two people are usually considered uncomfortable and/or awkward. Tension can be reduced by starting phatic talk until a more substantial subject arises. Generally, humans find prolonged silence uncomfortable, and sometimes unbearable. That can be due to human evolutionary history as a social species, as in many other [[social animals]], silence is a communicative sign of potential danger.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jordania]]. "Times to fight and times to relax: Singing and humming at the beginning of Human evolutionary history". Kadmos 1, 2009: 272–277&lt;/ref&gt;

In some conversations, there is no specific functional or informative element at all. The following example of small talk is between two colleagues who pass each other in a hallway:
: ''William'': Morning, Paul.
: ''Paul'': Oh, morning, William, how are you?
: ''William'': Fine, thanks. Have a good weekend?
: ''Paul'': Yes, thanks. Catch you later.
: ''William'': OK, see you.

In that example, the elements of phatic talk at the beginning and end of the conversation have merged. The entire short conversation is a space-filler. This type of discourse is often called ''chatter''.

The need to use small talk depends upon the nature of the relationship between the people having the conversation. Couples in an [[intimate relationship]] can signal their level of closeness by a lack of small talk. They can comfortably accept silence in circumstances that would be uncomfortable for two people who were only casual friends.&lt;ref&gt;Jaworski, A. (2000) "Silence and small talk", in: J. Coupland, ''Small Talk'', Pearson, Harlow UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In workplace situations, small talk tends to occur mostly between workers on the same level, but it can be used by [[management|managers]] as a way of developing the working relationships with the staff who report to them. Bosses who ask their employees to work [[overtime]] may try to [[motivation|motivate]] them by using small talk to temporarily decrease their difference in [[social status|status]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J. (1998) "Don't Under-Rate Small Talk", ''New Zealand Business'', 12,9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The balance between functional conversation and small talk in the workplace depends on the context and is also influenced by the relative [[Power (social and political)|power]] of the two speakers. It is usually the superior who defines the conversation because they have the power to close the small talk and "get down to business."&lt;ref name="holmesfillary"&gt;Holmes, J. &amp; Fillary, R. (2000) "Handling Small Talk at Work: challenges for workers with intellectual disabilities", ''International Journal of Disability'' 47,3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
The topics of small talk conversations are generally less important than their social function.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, K. &amp; Naughton, J. M. (2000) "Institutional identity-work: a better lens", in: J. Coupland, ''Small Talk'', Pearson, Harlow UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  The selected topic usually depends on any pre-existing [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] between the two people, and the circumstances of the conversation.  In either case, someone initiating small talk will tend to choose a topic for which they can assume a shared background knowledge, to prevent the conversation being too one-sided.&lt;ref name="holmesfillary" /&gt;

Topics can be summarised as being either direct or indirect.&lt;ref&gt;Ventola, E. (1979) "The Structure of Casual Conversation in English", ''Journal of Pragmatics'' 3: pp.267–298.&lt;/ref&gt;  Direct topics include personal observations such as [[health]] or [[looks]].  Indirect topics refer to a situational context such as the latest news, or the conditions of the communicative situation. Some topics are considered to be "safe" in most circumstances,&lt;ref name="holmeszerozero" /&gt; such as the weather, sports and television. Asking about the weather, however, should be avoided unless there exists follow-up discussion. Otherwise, the conversation will stall, and it will be the conversation starter's fault.&lt;ref name=holmeszerozero /&gt;

The level of detail offered should not overstep the bounds of interpersonal space.  When asked "How are you?" by an acquaintance they do not know well, a person is likely to choose a simple, generalised reply such as "I am good, thank you." In this circumstance it would usually not be appropriate for them to reply with a list of symptoms of any medical conditions they were suffering from.&lt;ref name="holmesfillary" /&gt;  To do so would assume a greater degree of [[intimacy|familiarity]] between the two people than is actually the case, and this may create an uncomfortable situation.

== Conversational patterns ==
A study of small talk in situations which involve the chance meeting of strangers has been carried out by Klaus Schneider.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, K. (1988) ''Small Talk: Analysing Phatic Discourse'', PhD thesis, Philipps-Universität, Marburg, W. Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; He theorises that such a conversation consists of a number of fairly predictable segments, or "moves". The first move is usually phrased so that it is easy for the other person to agree. It may be either a question, or a statement of opinion with a [[tag question]]. For example, an opening line such as "Lovely weather, isn't it?" is a clear invitation for agreement. The second move is the other person's response. In functional conversations that address a particular topic, [[Paul Grice|Grice's]] [[Cooperative principle#Maxim of Quantity|Maxim of Quantity]] suggests that responses should contain no more information than was explicitly asked for.&lt;ref&gt;Grice, H. P. (1975) "Logic and Conversation", in: P. Cole &amp; J. Morgan (eds.) ''Syntax and Semantics : Speech Acts'', Vol.3, Academic, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider claims that one of the principles of small talk contradicts the Maxim of Quantity. He suggests that [[politeness]] in small talk is maximised by responding with a more substantial answer. Going back to the example of "Lovely weather, isn't it?", to respond factually by just saying "Yes" (or even "No") is less polite than saying, "Yes, very mild for the time of year". Schneider describes that subsequent moves may involve an acknowledgement such as "I see", a positive evaluation such as "That's nice", or what's called "idling behaviour", such as "Mmm", or "Really?".

== Gender differences ==
Speech patterns between women tend to be more collaborative than those of men, and tend to support each other's involvement in the conversation. Topics for small talk are more likely to include compliments about some aspect of personal appearance. For example, "That dress really suits you."  Small talk between women who are friends may also involve a greater degree of [[self disclosure]]. Topics may cover more personal aspects of their life, their troubles, and their secrets. This self-disclosure both generates a closer relationship between them and is also a signal of that closeness.&lt;ref name="tannen"&gt;Tannen, D. (1992) "How men and women use language differently in their lives and in the classroom", ''The Education Digest'' 57,6.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, men's small talk tends to be more competitive. It may feature [[Stichomythia|verbal sparring matches]], [[Banter|playful insults]], and [[Insult|putdowns]].&lt;ref name="tannen" /&gt; However, in a way these are also both creators and signals of [[social solidarity|solidarity]]; the men are signalling that they are comfortable enough with each other's company to be able to say these things without them being taken as insults.

== Cultural differences ==
Small talk rules and topics can differ widely between [[culture]]s. Weather is a common topic in regions where the climate has great variation and can be unpredictable. Questions about the family are usual in some [[Asia]]n and [[Arab countries]]. In cultures or contexts that are status-oriented, such as [[Chinese culture|China]] and [[Japanese culture|Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (2000) ''Culture's Consequences'', revised edition, Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; small talk between new acquaintances may feature questions that enable social categorization of each other. Differences among members of various cultural groups in aspects of their attitudes to small talk and ways of dealing with small talk situations are considered to be rooted in their socioculturally ingrained perception of interpersonal relationships &lt;ref&gt;Cui, X. (2012, October 30).

Within the linguistic study of [[endangered languages]], sociolinguists distinguish between different '''speaker types''' based on the type of [[Competence (linguistics)|competence]] they have acquired of the endangered language. Often in situations where a community is gradually shifting away from an endangered language to a majority language, not all speakers acquire full linguistic competence, but have varying degrees and types of competence depending on the kind of exposure to the minority language they experienced in their upbringing. Originally the relevance of speaker types in situations of language shift was noted by [[Nancy Dorian]] who coined the term [[semi-speaker]] to refer to those speakers of Sutherland Gaelic who were predominantly English-speaking and whose Gaelic competence was limited and showed considerable influence from English.&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, N. C. (1977). The problem of the semi-speaker in language death. Linguistics, 15(191), 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, N. C. (1980). Language shift in community and individual: The phenomenon of the laggard semi-speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 1980(25), 85-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies added additional speaker types such as [[Speaker types#Typology|rememberers]] (who remember some words and phrases but have little or no grammatical competence and do not actively speak the language), [[Passive speaker (language)|passive speakers]] (who have nearly full comprehension competence but do not actively speak the language). In the context of language revitalization, [[new speakers]] who have learned the endangered language as a second language are sometimes distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Hornsby, Michael.

In contexts of language acquisition and language teaching studies sometimes there is a distinction between [[native speakers]] and [[Second language|second language speakers]], depending on whether language was learned as a language of primary socialisation or learned after already having fully acquired a first language. In contexts of [[multilingualism]] a bilingual speaker may also be described as a [[heritage speaker]] (A heritage language actually refers to a language whose speakers have moved from the original area where the language was spoken: e.g. Welsh is a heritage language in Patagonia, but not in Wales) if they have not been as fully exposed to one of their languages, leading to a diminished degree of confidence in themselves as speakers, and sometimes also limited competence in one of their languages.

==Typology==
A '''rememberer''' is a person who knows individual words or phrases (sometimes entire texts) but cannot use the target language productively. Such persons are of particular interest when studying any [[Endangered language|endangered]] or [[Language death|dying language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages|last = Grinevald|first = Colette|authorlink=Colette Grinevald|publisher = Cambridge|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 51|url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/colloques/3l_2012/pageweb/pdf/Grinevald%20&amp;%20Bert2011-Speakers&amp;Community.pdf|last2 = Bert|first2 = Michel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rememberers are contrasted with [[fluency|fluent]] or full speakers, who have a good command of the language, and [[semi-speaker]]s, who have a partial command of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Research Methods in Linguistics|last = Podesva|first = Robert J.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107696358|location = |pages = 52|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gU5kAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=rememberer+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LQ3k8zd5F9&amp;sig=fqDd-Vf1laDbkOva58-pc6A6oo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PgCyVNWNEsGwogTf_IHwAw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rememberer%20linguistics&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between fluent speakers and rememberers is important in fieldwork, but accurately determining where a member of a language community falls on the speaker-rememberer continuum can be challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Descriptive Linguistic Fieldwork|last = Chelliah|first = Shobhana L.|authorlink=Shobhana Chelliah|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2010|isbn = 978-9048190256|location = |pages = 176–177|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d1FfE30hZ7EC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=rememberer+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kBdn4yvVFI&amp;sig=cxxXaXUZDLl_0jvg16rehWK72F0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TgKyVLXlEtLloASOuoHYCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rememberer%20linguistics&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Passive speaker (language)|passive speaker]] (also referred to as a ''receptive bilingual'' or ''passive bilingual'') is someone who has had enough exposure to a language in childhood to have a [[native speaker|native-like]] comprehension of it, but has little or no active command of it. Such speakers are especially common in [[language shift]] communities where speakers of a declining language do not acquire active competence. Around 10% of the [[Ainu people]], for example, who speak the language are considered passive speakers. Passive speakers are often targeted in [[language revival]] efforts to increase the number of speakers of a language quickly, as they are likely to gain active and near-native speaking skills more quickly than those with no knowledge of the language. They are also found in areas where people grow up hearing another language outside their family with no formal education.

A '''semi-speaker''' is a speaker who has acquired a partial [[linguistic competence]] in a given language, but who does not generally use it regularly in conversation. Their speech can contain erroneous forms. Semi-speakers are often among the most motivated and engaged participants in language revitalization projects.&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Collette &amp; Michel Bert. 2011. "Speakers and Communities" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88215-6}}. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;  As languages become obsolete and [[speech community|speech communities]] shift to other languages, they are spoken less frequently and in fewer social domains. Many speakers learn the language partially, often in a simplified way, with significant influence from the majority language. They are sometimes referred to as "semi-speakers", "quasi-speakers" or "rememberers". The word semi-speaker was introduced by linguist [[Nancy Dorian]] in describing the last speakers of the East Sutherland dialect of [[Scottish Gaelic]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, Nancy C. 1980. Language Shift in Community and Individual: The Phenomenon of the Laggard Semi-Speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Vol. 1980, Iss. 25, Pages 85–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Dorian, "The Problem of the Semi-Speaker in Language Death," International Journal of the Sociology of Language 12 (1977): 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  When semi-speakers form a significant part of the speech, community [[language death|language contraction]] often ensues, as the linguistic norms are accommodated to the competences of the speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knowles-Berry |first=Susan |date=Winter 1987 |title=Linguistic decay in Chontal Mayan: the speech of semi-speakers |journal=Anthropological Linguistics |volume=29 |number=4 |pages=332–341 |jstor=30028108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorian |first=Nancy C. |date=September 1978 |title=Fate of morphological complexity in language death: Evidence from East Sutherland Gaelic |journal=Language |volume=54 |number=3 |pages=590–609 |jstor=412788 |doi=10.1353/lan.1978.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''terminal speaker''' is the last speaker of a language. A terminal speaker may still be alive, or may have been the last person speaking what is now an [[extinct language]].&lt;ref&gt;Polinsky, Maria. 1995. Cross-linguistic parallels in language loss. ''Southwest Journal of Linguistics'' 14.1-2 pp. 87-123.&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of [[language death]], the remaining speakers begin to lose some of the vocabulary and grammar of the language, so when there is only a last terminal speaker, the person will not remember a complete form of the language as it had been spoken by a larger community using it in all language domains. Being a terminal speaker means that the person is bilingual, remembering their [[heritage language]] but interacting with their community in another language. The importance of this distinction is seen in the story of [[Dolly Pentreath]] of [[Cornwall]]. She is popularly named as the last fluent, first-language speaker of [[Cornish language|Cornish]], but there were others who still spoke it for many years, though possibly incompletely. Terminal speakers are sometimes found by linguists doing [[language documentation]] on a language before it dies. A clear example of a terminal speaker being contacted by a linguist is the case of Abegaz, the last speaker of the [[Mesmes language]] in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Ahland, Michael Bryan. (2010). ''Language death in Mesmes''. Dallas: SIL International and the University of Texas at Arlington.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in an isolated hilly area and was about 80 years old when he was contacted by a team of sociolinguistic [[language survey]]ors; he has died since that contact.  [[Ned Maddrell]] was the last speaker of the [[Manx language]], having died in 1974. In 2008, Doris McLemore was reported to be the last speaker of the [[Wichita language]] as she worked with a team of linguists to document the language before it died completely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18532656 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt; Many more terminal speakers are listed under the Wikipedia category [[List of last known speakers of languages|Last known speakers of a language]].

'''Speech Buddies''' are a series of [[speech therapy]] tools that are used to remediate articulation and [[speech sound disorder]]s using the widely accepted teaching method of [[tactile feedback]]. Articulation, or speech sound disorders occur when a person has difficulty producing a sound correctly. Sounds may be left off, substituted, added or changed, making it difficult to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/speechsounddisorders.htm |title=Speech Sound Disorders: Articulation and Phonological Processes |publisher=Asha.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often occurring when children are learning to speak, these errors are considered a disorder if they persist after a certain [[developmental age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingchild.com/speechchart.html |title=What sounds should my child be saying? |publisher=Talkingchild.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A developmental age at which a child should be able to correctly produce a certain sound is different depending on the difficulty of the sound. The B-sound is one of the first mastered, while the R-sound is more difficult and may not be mastered until several years later.  Most articulation disorders are of no known cause, though many can be attributed to other disorders such as [[autism]], or [[hearing impairment]].

Speech Buddies help treat articulation disorders. There are five different Speech Buddies, each one addressing an individual sound: R, S, L, CH or SH. These tools teach correct [[tongue]] placement when trying to produce problem sounds. This type of learning is called tactile feedback, which uses the sense of touch to promote learning.

Preliminary research results from a single blind [[randomized controlled trial]] suggest that they may increase the speed in which a child can learn to correct his speech sound disorder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.speech-buddies.com/assets/files/White%20Paper%20SB%20Clincal%20Trial-8-20-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing research is exploring the use of Speech Buddies to help in other speech therapy applications including foreign [[accent reduction]], [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]], acquired [[apraxia of speech]] from [[stroke]] or [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI).  Experts have published clinical experiences using Speech Buddies for articulation disorders and apraxia in industry blogs such as Play on Words, Mommy Speech Therapy and traditional publications such as the [[Chicago Tribune]]. On May 31, 2011, Dr. Max Gomez of WCBS-NY reported on how Speech Buddies are being used to reduce overall cost and treatment time of speech therapy.

Speech Buddies were invented by Articulate Technologies, Inc., in [[San Francisco]], CA. Speech Buddies® and Speech Buddy™ are [[trademark]]s of Articulate Technologies, Inc. They are [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] listed [[medical device]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31401">'''Speech production''' is the process by which thoughts are translated into speech. This includes the selection of [[word]]s, the organization of relevant [[Grammar|grammatical]] forms, and then the articulation of the resulting sounds by the [[motor system]] using the [[vocal apparatus]]. Speech production can be spontaneous such as when a person creates the words of a [[conversation]], reactive such as when they name a picture or [[reading (process)|read]] aloud a [[writing|written word]], or imitative, such as in [[speech repetition]]. Speech production is not the same as [[language production]] since [[language]] can also be produced manually by [[sign language|sign]]s.

In ordinary fluent [[conversation]] people pronounce roughly four [[syllables]], ten or twelve [[phoneme]]s and two to three words out of their [[vocabulary]] (that can contain 10 to 100 thousand words) each second.&lt;ref name="Levelt99"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~rmk7/HC/HC_Readings/Levelt.pdf |pmid=10354575|year=1999|last1=Levelt|first1=WJ|title=Models of word production.|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in speech production are relatively rare occurring at a rate of about once in every 900 words in spontaneous speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garnham, A, Shillcock RC, Brown GDA, Mill AID, Culter A|year=1981|url=http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/15615/1/6017.pdf|title= Slips of the tongue in the London–Lund corpus of spontaneous conversation|journal=Linguistics |volume=19|pages=805–817|doi=10.1515/ling.1981.19.7-8.805|issue=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words that are [[Frequency list|commonly spoken]] or learned early in life or easily imagined are quicker to say than ones that are rarely said, learnt later in life, or are abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Oldfield  RC, Wingfield  A |year=1965|title=Response latencies in naming objects|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=17|pages=273–281|doi=10.1080/17470216508416445|pmid=5852918|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/33/1/73.full.pdf|pmid=11296722|year=2001|last1=Bird|first1=H|last2=Franklin|first2=S|last3=Howard|first3=D|title=Age of acquisition and imageability ratings for a large set of words, including verbs and function words|volume=33|issue=1|pages=73–9|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers|doi=10.3758/BF03195349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally speech is created with pulmonary pressure provided by the [[lung]]s that generates sound by [[phonation]] through the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]] that then is modified by the [[vocal tract]] into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However speech production can occur without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]] by using the upper parts of the vocal tract. An example of such alaryngeal speech is [[Donald Duck talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=5163900|year=1971|last1=Weinberg|first1=B|last2=Westerhouse|first2=J|title=A study of buccal speech|volume=14|issue=3|pages=652–8|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Research|bibcode=1972ASAJ...51Q..91W|doi=10.1121/1.1981697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocal production of speech may be associated with the production of hand [[gestures]] that act to enhance the comprehensibility of what is being said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McNeill D|year=2005|title=Gesture and Thought|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-51463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of speech production throughout an individual's life starts from an infant's first babble and is transformed into fully developed speech by the age of five.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"&gt;Harley, T.A. (2011), Psycholinguistics. (Volume 1). SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of speech doesn't occur until around age one (holophrastic phase). Between the ages of one and a half and two and a half the infant can produce short sentences (telegraphic phase). After two and a half years the infant develops systems of [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]]s used in speech production. Around four or five the child's lemmas are largely increased, this enhances the child's production of correct speech and they can now produce speech like an adult. An adult now develops speech in four stages: Activation of lexical concepts, select lemmas needed, [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] and [[phonologically]] encode speech, and the word is phonetically encoded.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt;

==Three stages==
The production of [[spoken language]] involves three major levels of processing: conceptualization, formulation, and articulation.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levelt89"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levelt | first = WJM | year = 1989 | title = Speaking: From Intention to Articulation | publisher = MIT Press | isbn = 978-0-262-62089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jescheniak"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jescheniak | first1 = JD | last2 = Levelt | first2 = WJM | year = 1994 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.133.3919 | title = Word frequency effects in speech production: retrieval of syntactic information and of phonological form | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | pages = 824–843 | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.20.4.824 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first is the processes of [[conceptualization]] or conceptual preparation, in which the intention  to create speech links a desired concept to the particular spoken words to be expressed. Here the preverbal intended messages are formulated that specify the concepts to be expressed.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition"&gt;Levelt, W. (1999). "The neurocognition of language", p.87 -117. Oxford Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The second stage is formulation in which the linguistic form required for the expression of the desired message is created. Formulation includes grammatical encoding, morpho-phonological encoding, and phonetic encoding.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt; Grammatical encoding is the process of selecting the appropriate syntactic word or [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]]. The selected lemma then activates the appropriate [[Syntax|syntactic]] frame for the conceptualized message. Morpho-phonological encoding is the process of breaking words down into syllables to be produced in overt speech. Syllabification is dependent on the preceding and proceeding words, for instance:
''I-com-pre-hend'' vs. ''I-com-pre-hen-dit''.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;
The final part of the formulation stage is phonetic encoding. This involves the activation of [[articulatory gestures]] dependent on the syllables selected in the morpho-phonological process, creating an articulatory score as the utterance is pieced together and the order of movements of the [[vocal apparatus]] is completed.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;

The third stage of speech production is articulation, which is the execution of the articulatory score by the lungs, glottis, larynx, [[tongue]], [[lips]], [[jaw]] and other parts of the vocal apparatus resulting in speech.&lt;ref name="Levelt89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;
[[File:Blausen 0215 CerebralHemispheres.png|thumb|141x141px|For right handed people, the majority of speech production activity occurs in the left cerebral hemisphere.]]

==Neuroscience==

The [[motor control]] for speech production in [[right handed|right handed people]] depends mostly upon areas in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]]. These areas include the bilateral [[supplementary motor area]], the left posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]], the left [[Insular cortex|insula]], the left [[primary motor cortex]] and [[temporal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2002.06.001|pmid=15037128|year=2004|last1=Indefrey|first1=P|last2=Levelt|first2=WJ|title=The spatial and temporal signatures of word production components|volume=92|issue=1–2|pages=101–44|journal=Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also subcortical areas involved such as the [[basal ganglia]] and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17189619|year=2007|last1=Booth|first1=JR|last2=Wood|first2=L|last3=Lu|first3=D|last4=Houk|first4=JC|last5=Bitan|first5=T|title=The role of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in language processing|volume=1133|issue=1|pages=136–44|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.11.074|pmc=2424405|journal=Brain Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ackermann"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 18471906|year= 2008|last1= Ackermann|first1= H|title= Cerebellar contributions to speech production and speech perception: psycholinguistic and neurobiological perspectives|volume= 31|issue= 6|pages= 265–72|doi= 10.1016/j.tins.2008.02.011|journal= Trends in Neurosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum aids the sequencing of speech syllables into fast, smooth and rhythmically organized words and longer utterances.&lt;ref name="Ackermann" /&gt;

==History of speech production research==
[[File:Speecherrorchart2.png|thumb|608x608px|Examples of speech errors. The target is what the speaker intended to say. The error is what the speaker actually said. These mistakes have been studied to learn about the structure of speech production.]]
Until the late 1960s research on speech was focused on comprehension. As researchers collected greater volumes of [[speech error]] data, they began to investigate the psychological processes responsible for the production of speech sounds and to contemplate possible processes for fluent speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Bernstein|first2=Nan|title=Speech Production Processing Models|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|isbn=0155041061|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from speech error research were soon incorporated into speech production models. Evidence from speech error data supports the following conclusions about speech production.

Some of these ideas include:

# Speech is planned in advance.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstien Ratner|first2=Nan|title=Chapter 7 Speech Production|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|isbn=0155041061|pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[lexicon]] is organized both semantically and phonologically.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; That is by meaning, and by the sound of the words.
# [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphologically]] complex words are assembled.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; Words that we produce that contain morphemes are put together during the speech production process. [[Morpheme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are the smallest units of language that contain meaning. For example, "ed" on a past tense word.
# [[Affix]]es and  functors behave differently from context words in slips of the tongue.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; This means the rules about the ways in which a word can be used are likely stored with them, which means generally when speech errors are made, the mistake words maintain their functions and make grammatical sense.
# [[Speech error]]s reflect rule knowledge.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; Even in our mistakes, speech is not nonsensical. The words and sentences that are produced in speech errors are typically grammatical, and do not violate the rules of the language being spoken.

== Aspects of speech production models ==
Models of speech production must contain specific elements to be viable. These include the elements from which speech is composed, listed below. The accepted models of speech production discussed in more detail below all incorporate these stages either explicitly or implicitly, and the ones that are now outdated or disputed have been criticized for overlooking one or more of the following stages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=John|title=Psycholinguistics|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415258901|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attributes of accepted speech models are:

a) a conceptual stage where the speaker abstractly identifies what they wish to express.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

b) a syntactic stage where a frame is chosen that words will be placed into, this frame is usually [[Syntax|sentence structure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

c) a lexical stage where a search for a word occurs based on meaning. Once the word is selected and retrieved, information about it becomes available to the speaker involving [[phonology]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

d) a phonological stage where the abstract information is converted into a speech like form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

e) a [[Phonetics|phonetic]] stage where instructions are prepared to be sent to the [[Vocal muscle|muscles of articulation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Also, models must allow for forward planning mechanisms, a buffer, and a monitoring mechanism.

Following are a few of the influential models of speech production that account for or incorporate the previously mentioned stages and include information discovered as a result of speech error studies and other disfluency data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstein|first2=Nan|title=Speech Production Processing Models|isbn=0155041061|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Tip of the tongue|tip-of-the-tongue]] research.

The Utterance Generator Model was proposed by Fromkin (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Bernstein Ratner|first2=Nan|title=Chapter 7 Speech Production|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers|location=Florida|isbn=0155041061|pages=328–337|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of six stages and was an attempt to account for the previous findings of speech error research. The stages of the Utterance Generator Model were based on possible changes in representations of a particular utterance. The first stage is where a person generates the meaning they wish to convey. The second stage involves the message being translated onto a syntactic structure. Here, the message is given an outline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|title=Utterance Generator Model of Speech Production in Psycho-linguistics|date=1971|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=0155041061|page=328|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third stage proposed by Fromkin is where/when the message gains different stresses and intonations based on the meaning. The fourth stage Fromkin suggested  is concerned with the selection of words from the [[lexicon]]. After the words have been selected in Stage 4, the message undergoes phonological specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|title=Utterance Generator Model of Speech Production in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt|page=330|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth stage applies rules of pronunciation and produces syllables that are to be outputted. The sixth and final stage of Fromkin's Utterance Generator Model is the coordination of the motor commands necessary for speech. Here, phonetic features of the message are sent to the relevant muscles of the vocal tract so that the intended message can be produced. Despite the ingenuity of Fromkin's model, researchers  have criticized this interpretation of speech production. Although The Utterance Generator Model accounts for many nuances and data found by speech error studies, researchers decided it still had room to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|title=The Garrett Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt College|isbn=0155041061|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butterworth|title=Psycho-linguistics|date=1982|publisher=Harcourt College|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garrett model (1975)===

A more recent (than Fromkin's) attempt to explain speech production was published by Garrett in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstein|first2=Nan|title=The Garret Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt College|isbn=0155041061|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett also created this model by compiling speech error data and there are many overlaps between this model and the Fromkin model off which it was based, but he did add a few things to the Fromkin model that filled some of the gaps being pointed out by other researchers. The Garrett Model and the Fromkin model both distinguish between three levels—a conceptual level, and sentence level, and a motor level. These three levels are common to contemporary understanding of Speech Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|last2=Fromkin|first2=V.A.|last3=Ratner|first3=N.B|title=The Garrett Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt College|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moraghfigure4.png|thumb|240x240px|This is an interpretation of the Dell's model. The  words at the top represent the semantic category. The second level represents the words that describe the semantic category. And, the third level represents the phonemes ( syllabic information including onset, vowels, and codas).]]

===Dell's model (1994)===

In 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production - Wikiversity|url = https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics/Models_of_Speech_Production|website = en.wikiversity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell proposed a model of the lexical network that became fundamental in the understanding of the way speech is produced.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt; This model of the lexical network attempts to symbolically represent the lexicon, and in turn, explain how people choose the words they wish to produce, and how those words are to be organized into speech. Dell's model was composed of three stages, semantics, words, and phonemes. The  words in the highest stage of the model represent the semantic category. (In the image, the words representing semantic category are winter, footwear, feet, and snow represent the semantic categories of boot and skate.) The second level represents the words that describe the semantic category (In the image, boot and skate). And, the third level represents the phonemes ( [[Syllable|syllabic information]] including [[Onset (linguistics)|onset]], vowels, and codas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Analysis of Sentence Production|last = Dell|first = G.S.|date = 1997|journal = Psychology of Learning and Motivation|doi = 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60270-4|pmid = |pages=133–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levelt model (1999) ===

Levelt further refined the lexical network proposed by Dell. Through the use of speech error data, Levelt recreated the three levels in Dell's model. The conceptual stratum, the top and most abstract level, contains information a person has about ideas of particular concepts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=d6b00eb6-6f33-46fd-9144-85377e4868eb%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=126&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=000080761300003&amp;db=edswsc|title = Models of Word Production|last = Levelt|first = Willem J.M|date = 1999|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01319-4|pmid = 10354575|access-date = 25 October 2015|volume=3|pages=223–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptual stratum also contains ideas about how concepts relate to each other. This is where word selection would occur, a person would choose which words they wish to express. The next, or middle level, the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]]-stratum, contains information about the syntactic functions of individual words including [[Tense (grammar)|tense]] and function.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt;  This level functions to maintain syntax and place words correctly into sentence structure that makes sense to the speaker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The lowest and final level is the form stratum which, similarly to the Dell Model, contains syllabic information. From here, the information stored at the form stratum level is sent to the motor cortex where the vocal apparatus are coordinated to physically produce speech sounds.

==Places of articulation==
{{main|Place of articulation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Human vocal apparatus used to produce speech|left|168x168px]]
The physical structure of the human nose, throat, and vocal cords allows for the productions of many unique sounds, these areas can be further broken down into [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]]. Different sounds are produced in different areas, and with different muscles and breathing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Consonantal Place of Articulation|last = Keren, Rice|publisher = John Wily &amp; Sons Inc.|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-4443-3526-2|location = |pages = 519–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our ability to utilize these skills to create the various sounds needed to communicate effectively is essential to our speech production. Speech is a psychomotor activity. Speech between two people is a [[conversation]] - they can be casual, formal, factual, or transactional, and the language structure/ narrative genre employed differs depending upon the context. Affect is a significant factor that  controls speech, manifestations that disrupt memory in language use due to affect include feelings of tension, states of apprehension, as well as physical signs like nausea. Language level manifestations that affect brings could be observed with the speaker's hesitations, repetitions, false starts, incompletion, syntactic blends, etc. Difficulties in [[manner of articulation]] can contribute to speech difficulties and [[Speech impediment|impediments]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speech Disorders : Causes, Treatments, and Social Effects|last = Harrison|first = Allen. E|publisher = Nova Science Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 9781608762132|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that infants are capable of making the entire spectrum of possible vowel and consonant sounds. [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] has created a system for understanding and categorizing all possible speech sounds, which includes information about the way in which the sound is produced, and where the sounds is produced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is extremely useful in the understanding of speech production because speech can be transcribed based on sounds rather than spelling, which may be misleading depending on the language being spoken. Average speaking rates are in the 120 to 150 words per minute (wpm) range, and same is the recommended guidelines for recording audiobooks. As people grow accustomed to a particular language they are prone to lose not only the ability to produce certain speech sounds, but also to distinguish between these sounds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Articulation===
Articulation, often associated with speech production, is the term used to describe how people physically produced speech sounds. For people who speak fluently, articulation is automatic and allows 15 speech sounds to be produced per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=John|title=Psycholinguistics The Key Concepts|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415258901|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effective articulation of speech include the following elements – fluency, complexity, accuracy, and comprehensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rebecca Hughes|author2=Beatrice Szczepek Reed|title=Teaching and Researching Speaking: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cC4lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-43299-9|pages=6+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Fluency: Is the ability to communicate an intended message, or to affect the listener in the way that is intended by the speaker. While accurate use of language is a component in this ability, over-attention to accuracy may actually inhibit the development of fluency. Fluency involves constructing coherent utterances and stretches of speech, to respond and to speak without undue hesitation (limited use of fillers such as uh, er, eh, like, you know). It also involves the ability to use strategies such as simplification and gestures to aid communication. Fluency involves use of relevant information, appropriate vocabulary and [[syntax]].  

*Complexity: Speech where the message is communicated precisely. Ability to adjust the message or negotiate the control of conversation according to the responses of the listener, and use subordination and clausal forms appropriate per the roles and relationship between the speakers. It includes the use of sociolinguistic knowledge – the skills required to communicate effectively across cultures; the norms, the knowledge of what is appropriate to say in what situations and to whom.

*Accuracy: This refers to the use of proper and advanced grammar; subject-verb agreement; word order; and word form (excited/exciting), as well as appropriate word choice in spoken language. It is also the ability to self-correct during discourse, to clarify or modify spoken language for grammatical accuracy.

*Comprehensibility: This is the ability to be understood by others, it is related with the sound of the language.  There are three components that influence one’s comprehensibility and they are: ''Pronunciation'' – saying the sounds of words correctly; ''Intonation'' – applying proper stress on words and syllables, using rising and falling pitch to indicate questions or statements, using voice to indicate emotion or emphasis, speaking with an appropriate rhythm; and ''Enunciation'' – speaking clearly at an appropriate pace, with effective articulation of words and phrases and appropriate volume.

==Development==
{{main|Language acquisition}}
Before even producing a sound, infants imitate facial expressions and movements.&lt;ref name="Redford, M. A. 2015"&gt;Redford, M. A. (2015). The handbook of speech production. Chichester, West Sussex ; Malden, MA : John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 7 months of age, infants start to experiment with communicative sounds by trying to coordinate producing sound with opening and closing their mouths.

Until the first year of life infants cannot produce coherent words, instead they produce a reoccurring [[babbling]] sound. Babbling allows the infant to experiment with articulating sounds without having to attend to meaning. This repeated babbling starts the initial production of speech. Babbling works with [[object permanence]] and understanding of location to support the networks of our first [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] items or words.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; The infant’s vocabulary growth increases substantially when they are able to understand that objects exist even when they are not present.

The first stage of meaningful speech does not occur until around the age of one. This stage is the holophrastic phase.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. 2005"&gt;Shaffer, D., Wood, E., &amp; Willoughby, T. (2005). Developmental Psychology Childhood and Adolescence. (2nd Canadian Ed). Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt; The holistic stage refers to when infant speech consists of one word at a time (i.e. papa).

The next stage is the telegraphic phase. In this stage infants can form short sentences (i.e., Daddy sit, or Mommy drink). This typically occurs between the ages of one and a half and two and a half years old. This stage is particularly noteworthy because of the explosive growth of their [[lexicon]]. During this stage, infants must select and match stored representations of words to the specific perceptual target word in order to convey meaning or concepts.&lt;ref name="Redford, M. A. 2015"/&gt; With enough vocabulary, infants begin to extract sound patterns, and they learn to break down words into [[phonological]] segments, increasing further the number of words they can learn.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; At this point in an infant's development of speech their lexicon consists of 200 words or more and they are able to understand even more than they can speak.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. 2005"/&gt;
 
When they reach two and a half years their speech production becomes increasingly complex, particularly in its semantic structure. With a more detailed [[semantic network]] the infant learns to express a wider range of meanings, helping the infant develop a complex conceptual system of [[lemma (psycholinguistics)|lemma]]s.

Around the age of four or five the child lemmas have a wide range of diversity, this helps them select the right lemma needed to produce correct speech.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; Reading to infants enhances their lexicon. At this age, children who have been read to and are exposed to more uncommon and complex words have 32 million more words than a child who is [[linguistically]] impoverished.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, M. (2005). Proust and the squid:The story and science of the reading brain, New York, NY. Harper&lt;/ref&gt; At this age the child should be able to speak in full complete sentences, similar to an adult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">{{Distinguish|Telegram style}}
'''Telegraphic speech''', according to [[linguistics]] and [[psychology]], is speech during the [[Critical period#Linguistics|two-word stage]] of [[language acquisition]] in children, which is laconic and efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, S. (2004). ''Psychology (2nd ed.).'' Boston: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name derives from the fact that someone sending a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] was generally charged by the word. To save money, people typically wrote their telegrams in [[Telegram style|a very compressed style]], without [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] or [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. As children develop language, they speak similarly: when a child says "Daddy here", it is understood that the child means "Daddy is here", omitting the copula. The words dropped in this style of speech are [[closed class]] or [[function word|function]] words.

In the field of [[psychology]], telegraphic speech is defined as a form of communication consisting of simple two-word long sentences often composed of a noun and a verb that adhere to the grammatical standards of the culture's language. For example, an English-speaking child would say "Give cupcake" to express that they would like a cupcake rather than "Cupcake give", as a Turkish- or Japanese-speaking child would. Researchers have noted that this period of [[language acquisition]] occurs some time between the ages of 18–36 months and is present not just in English-speaking cultures, but can be found worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, L. (1970). ''Language development: Form and function in emerging grammars.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In adults, regression to telegraphic speech may indicate a neurological problem such as [[multiple sclerosis]]. Telegraphic speech is also common in non-fluent aphasia ([[Broca's aphasia]]), which is caused by a stroke damaging the posterior-inferior frontal lobe. It is also a potential symptom of schizophrenia, as a manifestation of manneristic speech.

==Production==
Seth Kramer, one of the directors, describes how he first got the idea for ''The Linguists'' when, in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], he could not read [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] inscriptions on a path in spite of his [[Jewish]] heritage. He joined with Daniel A. Miller in 2003 to form Ironbound Films, and received a $520,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to support the film.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Later in 2003, the directors chose [[Gregory Anderson (linguist)|Anderson]] and Harrison to be the protagonists of the film.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; In 2004, director Jeremy Newberger joined the project.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

It took three years to film ''The Linguists'', and during this time over 200 hours of film were collected.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  During this time, the cast and crew travelled to numerous remote areas that one reporter describes as "godforsaken,"&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; and coped with physical ailments such as [[altitude sickness]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The film was completed in August 2007.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web | date=13 January 2008 | last=Hughes | first=Jennifer V | accessdate=22 February 2009 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/13artswe.html?_r=1 | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Racing to Capture Vanishing Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

[[File:Free Tibet - 4 tibetan script styles.jpg|left|thumb|Four different Tibetan script styles traditionally and commonly used by Tibetans]]
'''Tibetan calligraphy''' refers to the [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] traditions used to write the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]].  As in other parts of East Asia, nobles, high lamas, and persons of high rank were expected to have high abilities in calligraphy.  However, unlike calligraphy in [[Chinese calligraphy|China]], [[Japanese calligraphy|Japan]], and Korea, calligraphy was done using a reed pen as opposed to a brush.  Nevertheless, East Asian influence is apparent visually, as Tibetan calligraphy is at times more free-flowing than calligraphy involving the descendants of other [[Brahmic family|Brahmi]] scripts. Given the overriding religious nature of [[Tibetan culture]], many of the traditions in calligraphy come from religious texts, and most Tibetan scribes have a monastic background.&lt;ref&gt;https://tashimannox.com/index.php/tibetan-calligraphy/about-the-artist&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
A variety of different styles of calligraphy existed in Tibet:

* The '''[[Uchen script|Uchen]]''' ({{bo-textonly|དབུ་ཅན།}}, "headed"; also transliterated as ''uchan'' or ''dbu-can'') style of the [[Tibetan script]] is marked by heavy horizontal lines and tapering vertical lines, and is the most common script for writing in the Tibetan language, and also appears in printed form because of its exceptional clarity.  When handwritten, it is the most basic form of calligraphy, and must be mastered before moving onto other styles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kimsch.net/Tibetan%20Calligraphy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
** Ngatar ({{bo-textonly|སྔ་དར།}}) development
*** Toad - the initial Thonmi Sambhota edition
** Qitar ({{bo-textonly|ཕྱི་དར།}}) development
*** '''Sarqung''' or '''chung''' (standard ujain; {{bo-textonly|གསར་ཆུང༌།}})
*** '''Sugring'''
*** '''Sugtung'''
*** '''Sarqên'''
* The '''[[Umê script|umê]]''' ({{bo-textonly|དབུ་མེད།|ume=1}}, "headless"; or ''ume'') style is a more cursive script which can be seen in daily correspondence and in other day-to-day life.  The feature which distinguishes it the most from ''u-chan'' is the lack of the horizontal lines on the top of letters.
* The '''bêcug''' ({{bo-textonly|དཔེ་ཚུགས།}}; or ''betsu'') style is a narrow, cursive variant of ''umê'' in squarish shape.
* The ''zhuza'' ({{bo-textonly|འབྲུ་ཚ།}}; or ''drutsa'') style is a variant of ''umê'' but with ''ujain'' vowel symbol.
** curve-leg zhuza
** straight-leg zhuza
** short-leg zhuza
* The ''cugtung'' ({{bo-textonly|ཚུགས་ཐུང༌།}}; or ''tsugtung'') style is shortened, abbreviated variant of ''u-me'', traditionally used for commentaries.
* The ''cugrin'' ({{bo-textonly|ཚུགས་རིན།}}) style
* The ''kyug'yig'' ({{bo-textonly|འཁྱུག་ཡིག།}}, "fast letters"; or ''chuyig'') is a highly abbreviated, fluid, cursive version of ''u-me''.  It is a common form of handwriting for notes and personal letters.
** general cursive
** extremely cursive
* The ''cug-ma-kyug'' yig style - a style halfway between ''cug'yig'' and ''kyug'yig''
* The ''gyug'yig'' ({{bo-textonly|རྒྱུག་ཡིག།}}) style

==Other related styles==
The vertical [[Phagspa script|Phags-pa]] script is known as ''horyig'' ({{bo-textonly|ཧོར་ཡིག་}} ''hor-yig'', "Mongolian letters").  A more ornamental version of the ''horyig'' style was used in the past to make personal seals. It is often found written vertically as opposed to horizontally.

These styles are not fixed, and are not limited to those listed above. By mixing features of various styles, and adding various ornaments to the text, the number of styles becomes quite large. While ''ujain'' may be used to write entire [[Sutra]]s or Buddhist texts, the rest of the styles are more frequently used to write a single phrase or saying.

==Notable examples==
The world record for the longest calligraphy scroll is held by Jamyang Dorjee Chakrishar, who penned a 163.2 meter scroll containing 65,000 Tibetan characters. The scroll contains prayers for the [[14th Dalai Lama]] composed by 32 different monks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tibetancalligraphy.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tripartite language''', also called an '''ergative–accusative language''', is one that treats the agent of a [[transitive verb]], the patient of a transitive verb, and the single argument of an [[intransitive verb]] each in different ways.  This contrasts with [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] and [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] languages. If the language has [[morphological case]], the arguments are marked in this way:

* the ''agent'' of a transitive verb takes the [[ergative case]]
* the ''object'' of a transitive verb takes the [[accusative case]]
* the single argument of an intransitive verb takes the [[intransitive case]]

==Examples==
In this [[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]] intransitive sentence, the intransitive argument has no suffix and the verb carries the third person agreement prefix ''hi-'':
:{|
|- 
| Hi-páayn-a || háama 
|-
| {{sc|3nom}}-arrive-{{sc|asp}} || man.{{sc|intr}} 
|-
|colspan=2|"The man arrived." &lt;ref name=Rude1986&gt;Rude, Noel. 1986. Topicality, transitivity, and the direct object in Nez Perce. ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 52:124-153.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}}
|}
In a transitive sentence with two third person arguments, the agent is marked with ''-n(i)m'', the patient with ''-ne'', and the verb with the third person on third person transitive agreement marker ''pée-'':
:{|
|-
| Háama-nm || pée-'wi-ye || wewúkiye-ne
|-
| man-{{sc|erg}} || {{sc|3tr}}-shoot-{{sc|asp}} || elk-{{sc|acc}}
|-
|colspan=3|"The man shot the elk."&lt;ref name=Rude1986/&gt;{{rp|126}}
|}

The [[Ainu language|Ainu language of northern Japan]] also shows tripartite marking in its pronominal prefixes, with the first person ''Ku='' being the ergative form, ''=an'' being the intransitive form and ''=en='' being the accusative form. Ainu also shows the [[passive voice]] formation typical of nominative-accusative languages and the [[antipassive]] of ergative-absolutive languages. Like Nez Percé, the use of both the passive and antipassive is a trait of a tripartite language.

Tripartite languages are rare. Besides Native American Nez Perce, they include the Vakh dialects of the [[Khanty language]], [[Wangkumara language|Wangkumara]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and, in its singular pronouns, [[Kala Lagaw Ya language|Kalaw Lagaw Ya]]. [[Yazghulami language|Yazghulami]] is tripartite, but only in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R.M.W.]] (1994). ''Ergativity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[constructed language]]s, especially [[engineered language]]s, use a tripartite case system or tripartite adposition system, notably the fictional [[Na'vi language]] featured in the 2009 movie [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9590">[[File:Flock of birds at Rome.ogg|right|300px|thumb|Although this flock is made of the same ''type'' of bird, each individual bird is a different ''token''. (50 MB video of a [[Flock (birds)|flock of birds]] in Rome)|thumbtime=6]]
The '''type–token distinction''' is used in disciplines such as [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[metalogic]], [[typography]], and [[computer programming]] to clarify what words mean.

==Overview==
The sentence "''they drive the same car''" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same ''type'' of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type–token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).

For example: "bicycle" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas "my bicycle" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence "the bicycle is becoming more popular" the word "bicycle" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" the word "bicycle" represents a token: a particular object.

(The distinction in [[computer programming]] between [[class (software)|classes]] and [[object (computer science)|objects]] is related, though in this context, "class" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as "type" would.)

The words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is "thorny", "flowering" and "bushy". You might say a rose bush ''instantiates'' these three types, or ''embodies'' these three concepts, or ''exhibits'' these three properties, or ''possesses'' these three qualities, features or attributes.

Property types (e.g "height in metres" or "thorny") are often understood [[ontology|ontologically]] as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality.

Some say types exist in descriptions of objects, but not as tangible [[physical object]]s. They say one can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone the type "bicycle", as in "''the bicycle'' is popular.". However types do exist in the sense that they appear in mental and documented models.

Some say tokens are objects that are tangible, exist in space and time as physical matter and/or energy. However, tokens can be intangible objects of types such as "thought", "tennis match", "government" and "act of kindness".

== Occurrences ==
There is a related distinction very closely connected with the type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an '''''occurrence''''' of it. In this sense, an occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence: "[[A rose is a rose is a rose]]". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: "rose", "is" and "a". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.

The need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/types-tokens Types and Tokens]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection on the simple case of occurrences of [[numeral system|numerals]] is often helpful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Claim made with no support or citation, term used without definition.}}

== Typography ==
In [[typography]], the type–token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by [[movable type]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]]: ''Die Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine paläographisch-typographische Untersuchung'', Scriptorium Verlag für Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-937527-06-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The defining criteria which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the type identity of the various [[letter form]]s which make up the printed text. In other words: each letter form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("token") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]].}}

== Charles Sanders Peirce ==
:''There are only 26 letters in the [[English alphabet]] and yet there are more than 26 letters in this [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created.''

The word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having "type–token ambiguity". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician-philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in 1906 using terminology that he established.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, Prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism, Monist, vol.16 (1906), pp. 492–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.

'''Peirce's type–token distinction''', also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or [[concatenation theory]]. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,&lt;ref&gt;Using a variant of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s structural-descriptive naming found in [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], [https://philarchive.org/archive/CORSTC Schemata: the Concept of Schema in the History of Logic], Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12 (2006), pp. 219–40.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.

The word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type.

Peirce's original words are the following.
"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice .... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. .... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies." – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.

These distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph.

:''There are 26 letter types in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letter occurrences in this sentence type. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letter tokens have been created.''

An '''uncertain plural''' occurs when a writer does not know in advance whether a word should be written in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] or [[plural]].  For [[English language|English]] nouns, this may be demonstrated by enclosing the trailing ''s'' in parentheses, such as "book(s)".

In the case of articles, "they" or "their" may be used to include a single individual, when uncertain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15049">{{redirect|Vague}}
In [[philosophy]], '''vagueness''' refers to an important problem in [[semantics]], [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophical logic]]. Definitions of this problem vary. A predicate is sometimes said to be vague if the bound of its extension is indeterminate, or appears to be so. The predicate "is tall" is vague because there seems to be no particular height at which someone becomes tall. Relatedly, a predicate is sometimes said to be vague if there are borderline cases of its application, such that in these cases competent speakers of the language may faultlessly disagree over whether the predicate applies. The disagreement over whether a hotdog is a sandwich suggests that “sandwich” is vague. 

Vagueness is commonly introduced by the Sorites paradox. A standard form of this paradox features a 2000 man sequence of progressively taller men, starting with a paradigm case of a short man at one extreme, say George Costanza, and at the other extreme, a paradigm case of a tall one, say Kramer. 

* Base step: Man 1 (George Costanza) is short.
* Induction step: If man ''n'' is short, then man ''n + 1'' is short.
* Conclusion: Man 2000 (Kramer) is short. 

Sorites paradoxes exploit the intuition that some vague predicates are ''tolerant'' with respect to small enough differences on a dimension decisive of their application. This principle may seem to hold on the basis that (for example) no particular height is more justified than others in its vicinity as a cut-off for shortness. This intuition has been called the ''No Sharp Boundaries'' thesis about vague predicates and plays a prominent role in theories of vagueness. 

The Sorites paradox dates to the fourth century BCE and is attributed to [[Eubulides|Eubulides of Melitus]]. It has received a resurgence of attention since 1975, when three papers published in ''Synthese'' effectively conceived the contemporary study of vagueness.  

The problem posed by vagueness is to explain its particular kind of indeterminacy. Does vagueness render large portions of ordinary language meaningless? Likely not, since we frequently use vague language to great effect in ordinary discourse. If not, what ''is'' vagueness, at the level of predicate logic? How is it to be modeled without contradiction, and without sacrificing too much of classical logic? Is vagueness semantic, metaphysical or epistemic? 

Vagueness has in its own right reaped the attention of an extensive literature. In addition, vagueness is a topic that touches many other questions in philosophy, linguistics and cognitive science, not to mention ordinary conversation. 

== Importance ==
Vagueness is philosophically important. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of "right" in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances [[precising definition]]s.&lt;ref name="Williamson.1994"&gt;[[Timothy Williamson|Williamson, T]]. 1994. ''Vagueness'', {{page needed|date=April 2017}}. London: Routledge. &lt;br /&gt;The history of the problem of vagueness is traced, from the first [[Sorites Paradox]] to contemporary attempts to deal with higher-order vagueness such as [[many-valued logic]], [[supervaluationism]], and [[fuzzy logic]]. Technicalities are kept to a minimum to favour a clear account, extremely useful to both students and researchers.{{citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=Specific claims regarding the usefulness of a source to readers of this article.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept.  Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc.  Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as gender can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from [[transsexual]]s' gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see [[intersex]]).

Many scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance [[species]] in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as [[ring species]].  Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases.  As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is "vague" is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding [[Husky|huskies]] and [[wolf|wolves]]: are they [[dog]]s? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one's ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.

== Approaches ==
The philosophical question of what the best theoretical treatment of vagueness is - which is closely related to the problem of the [[paradox of the heap]], a.k.a. sorites paradox - has been the subject of much philosophical debate.

=== Fuzzy logic ===
[[File:Fuzzy logic temperature en.svg|thumb|In fuzzy logic, e.g. the predicates ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' apply gradually (vertical axis, 0 and 1 meaning ''certainly not'' and ''certainly'', respectively) to a given temperature (horizontal axis).]]
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
One theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician [[Lotfi Zadeh]]. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between "perfect falsity", for example, the statement "[[Bill Clinton]] is bald", to "perfect truth", for, say, "[[Patrick Stewart]] is bald". In ordinary logics, there are only two [[truth-value]]s: "true" and "false". The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing ''an infinite number of truth-values'' along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by "1", and perfect falsity by "0". Borderline cases are thought of as having a "truth-value" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) &lt;ref&gt;Machina, K.F. 1976. "Truth, belief and vagueness", in ''[[Journal of Philosophical Logic]]'' Vol. 5. pp. 47-78&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dorothy Edgington]] (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Edgington, D.| title=Vagueness by degrees| year=1997| pages=294–316| publisher=MIT Press| editor=Keefe, R. |editor2=Smith, P.| url=http://www.jo_syp.republika.pl/media/vbd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supervaluationism ===
{{main|Supervaluationism}}
Another theoretical approach is known as "supervaluationism". This approach has been defended by [[Kit Fine]] and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of "[[truth value]] gaps". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be "made precise" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.&lt;ref&gt;Kit Fine, ''The Limits of Abstraction'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate 'supertrue' as meaning "true on all precisifications".  This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. 'Frank is bald', where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of sentential logic, such as 'Frank is bald or Frank is not bald', will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either 'Frank is bald' or 'Frank is not bald' will be true.  Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can "rescue" them is seen as a virtue.

=== Subvaluationism ===
{{main|Dialetheism}}
Subvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as 'supertruth', the subvaluationist characterises truth as 'subtruth', or "true on at least some precisifications".&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Cobreros, (2011) "Paraconsistent Vagueness: A Positive Argument" ''Synthese'' 183(2): 211–227&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has 'truth-value gluts'. According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Hyde and Mark Colyvan (2008) “Paraconsistent Vagueness: Why Not?” ''Australasian Journal of Logic'' 6: 107–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Of a borderline case of 'bald man' it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.

=== The epistemicist view ===
{{main|Epistemicism}}
A fourth approach, known as the "epistemicist view", has been defended by [[Timothy Williamson]] (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, T. 1994. ''Vagueness'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Sorensen|R. A. Sorensen]] (1988) &lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R.A. 1988. ''Blindspots''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Sorensen, Roy| title=Vagueness and Contradiction| year=2001| publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nicholas Rescher]] (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, N.]] 2009. ''Unknowability''. Lexington Books. &lt;br&gt; Uses [[vagrant predicate]]s to elucidate the problem.&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One's confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is explained as being due to one's ignorance. For example, on the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old. It is just that one may sometimes be ignorant of this fact.

===As a property of objects===

One possibility is that one's words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague.  Consider [[Peter Unger]]'s example of a [[cloud]] (from his famous 1980 paper, "The Problem of the Many"):  it's not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it's part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one won't know how to answer.  So perhaps one's term 'cloud' denotes a vague object precisely.  This strategy has been poorly received, in part due to [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans's]] short paper "Can There Be Vague Objects?" (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Evans, G.| title=Can There Be Vague Objects?| journal=Analysis| year=1978| volume=38| pages=208–| doi=10.1093/analys/38.4.208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans's argument appears to show that there can be no vague identities (e.g. "Princeton = Princeton Borough"), but as Lewis (1988) makes clear, Evans takes for granted that there are in fact vague identities, and that any proof to the contrary cannot be right.  Since the proof Evans produces relies on the assumption that terms precisely denote vague objects, the implication is that the assumption is false, and so the vague-objects view is wrong.

Still by, for instance, proposing alternative deduction rules involving [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's law]] or other rules for validity some philosophers are willing to defend vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon. One has, for example, [[Peter van Inwagen]] (1990),&lt;ref&gt;Van Inwagen, Peter. 1990 ''Material Beings''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Trenton Merricks and Terence Parsons (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Terence. 2000. ''Indeterminate Identity - Metaphysics and Semantics'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal principle== &lt;!--- courtesy under WP:LINK, [[Albert Haddock]] links here]] --&gt;
In the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations.  The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be "void for vagueness" and unenforceable.  This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid "explicit" or "objectionable" contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the [[vagueness doctrine]] and in Europe as the [[principle of legal certainty]].
