==Contents==
The book's 100 chapters each cover in a couple of pages one of the 100 things that the author suggests successful people do. A reviewer writes: "the book, subtitled Little Exercises For Successful Living, is easily digestible (perhaps even as a tip a day), with each spread over two pages – the first explaining the concept and the second featuring practical exercises and activities to apply it to your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/the-life/book-review-unlearn-it-all-to-move-ahead |title=Book review: Unlearn it all to move ahead &amp;#124; The National |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2016-09-06 |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another adds: "each secret to success is a powerful reminder of the ways you can make your life – and other's – more satisfied, at work, at home and in your relationships, with your health, wealth and in retirement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/successful-leaders-little-secrets-659239.html |title=Successful leaders' little secrets - Business - Arabian- Business -.com |publisher=Arabianbusiness.com |date=2017-01-17 |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1996-1999)===
Tony's friends Robert and Jerry traveled to [[Arkansas]] to train with professional wrestlers [[The Moondogs]] and invited him to come along.&lt;ref name="WWD9"/&gt; After watching several training sessions, Tony was invited into the ring. He soon began training alongside his friends, free of charge, because [[Moondog Spot]] felt that Tony "was a natural for the business."&lt;ref name="WWD9"/&gt; Tony started wrestling in [[Indiana]] in a small bingo hall, where he first met wrestler [[Steve Robinson (wrestler)|Corporal Robinson]].&lt;ref name="WWD9"/&gt; He, Robinson, and [[Mad Man Pondo]] began traveling throughout the country together.&lt;ref name="WWD10"&gt;{{cite video |people=2 Tuff Tony and Corporal Robinson (Interviewees) |date=2010-09-27 |title=Wrestling with Disaster 10 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIvaXDWOgOM  |medium=internet production |publisher=Legit Wrestling |accessdate=2010-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video distribution company Smart Mark Video helped the trio gain national exposure.&lt;ref name="WWD10"/&gt;

===Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (1999-2007)===
Tony began working for [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South]] (IWA-MS) in 1999. He wrestled his first match against Rolling Hard, where he was introduced to the [[hardcore wrestling]] style of the company.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"&gt;{{cite video |people=Mr. Wrestling (interviewer), 2 Tuff Tony (interviewee) |date=2011-03-02 |title=JCW's 2 Tuff Tony on Ultraviolent Radio 3-2-2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRaIOS28ts |medium=Internet Interview |accessdate=2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing that Tony had never wrestled in the hardcore style before, Mad Man Pondo requested to work with him in matches.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt; The promotion's owner, [[Ian Rotten]], supported the idea and booked the two in a rivalry.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt; Pondo acquainted him to the proper techniques of hardcore wrestling, and Tony later recalled that Pondo "took good care of me" in their matches.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt;

On April 29, 1999, Tony defeated Pondo for the [[IWA Mid-South Hardcore Championship]].&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ky/iwams/iwams-hc.html |title=Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South Hardcore Title |accessdate=2011-03-17 |publisher=Puroreso Dojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the championship on May 14 to Pondo, but won it back the following day.&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"/&gt; The following February he lost the championship, but won the [[IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship]] two weeks later.&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ky/iwams/iwams-h.html |title=Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South Heavyweight Title |accessdate=2011-03-17 |publisher=Puroreso Dojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, he defeated Pondo and Delilah Starr to unify the IWA-MS Hardcore and Heavyweight Championships.&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"/&gt; Two weeks later, Tony lost the championship.&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"/&gt; He won it for a second time the following March 2, before losing it to Mitch Page a month later.&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"/&gt;

In 2006, Tony and Mad Man Pondo took part in the first [[IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch#IWA Mid-South Double Death Tag Team Tournament|Double Death Tag Team Tournament]], though they weren't told which team would win the tournament.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt; They defeated Children of Pain then Dysfunction and Corporal Robinson to make it to the finals. In the finals, Tony and Pondo defeated Tough Crazy Bastards to be crowned the first Double Death Tag Team Tournament champions.

Tony continued wrestling for Juggalo Championship Wrestling, including matches at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] festivals and two other videos released by the company.

Tony went on tour with JCW in 2007 to film the [[internet]] [[Professional wrestling|wrestling]] show [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling#SlamTV!|SlamTV!]], where he was involved in a rivalry with [[Tracy Smothers]].&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1"&gt;{{cite video|date=2007-09-18|title=JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194583|medium=DVD|publisher=Psychopathic Video|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy attacked Tony in the sixth episode, causing Tony to be knocked out of action for several weeks.&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1"/&gt; Per storyline, Smothers was arrested just days before Tony's return on the eighth episode, leaving Tony with no way to seek revenge.&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1"/&gt; Tony was attacked by [[Bull Pain]] at East Side Wars, but later defeated him in a [[Hillerich &amp; Bradsby|Louisville Slugger]] match at [[Bloodymania (2007)|Bloodymania]].&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 2"&gt;{{cite video|date=2007-10-30|title=JCW SLAM TV, Volume 2|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194584/|medium=DVD|publisher=Psychopathic Video|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, 2008, Tony and [[Violent J]] won the [[JCW Tag Team Championship]]. However, their victory was declared void, stricken from the record, and the title was vacated.&lt;ref name="Jan262008"&gt;{{cite web |title=JCW January 26, 2008 |url=http://www.cagematch.de/?id=1&amp;nr=18279 |publisher=Cagematch |accessdate=13 August 2008 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SlamTV2-1"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Slam TV Season 2 - Episode 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1ph1KX5BiQ |series=SlamTV! |credits=Creator and Producer: [[Insane Clown Posse]] |location=Toledo, Ohio |airdate=2008-06-16 |season=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Main Event Feb 22"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Feb 22, 2011|series=The Main Event |url=http://wfuckoffradio.com/wpress/?p=51 |credits=Presenters: [[Violent J]], 2 Tuff Tony, and [[Steve Robinson (wrestler)|Corporal Robinson]] |station=WFKO |airdate=2011-02-22 |minutes= 3:21:00|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512054432/http://wfuckoffradio.com/the-main-event|archivedate=May 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony continued his rivalry with Tracy Smothers into season two of SlamTV!

At the 2008 Hallowicked After-Party, Tony joined the group the [[Juggalo World Order]]. On November 9, the Juggalo World Order (Scott Hall, Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J, 2 Tuff Tony, and Corporal Robinson) "invaded" [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]'s [[Turning Point (2008 wrestling)|Turning Point]] PPV  by purchasing front row tickets to the event. They proceeded to promote their faction by flashing their JWO jerseys, which each member had on, before being removed from the building.&lt;ref name="PWTorch Nov 9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_27798.shtml |last=Caldwell |first=James  |title=Scott Hall appears on camera with ICP at tonight's TNA PPV |accessdate=10 November 2008 |publisher=ProWrestlingTorch |date=2008-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Main Event Nov 11"&gt;{{cite episode|title=November 11, 2008 |series=The Main Event |url=http://wfuckoffradio.com/wfko.php/shows/15 |credits=Presenters: [[Violent J]], 2 Tuff Tony, and [[Corporal Robinson]] |station=WFKO |airdate=2008-11-11 |minutes=48:18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126090212/http://www.psychopathicradio.com/site/ |archive-date=January 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Bloodymania III]], 2 Tuff Tony was defeated by [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|"Loser leaves JCW"]] match with [[Terry Funk]] as special guest referee due to interference by [[Balls Mahoney]].&lt;ref name="The Main Event July 20"&gt;{{cite episode|title=July 20, 2010| series=The Main Event| url=http://wfuckoffradio.com/wfko.php/shows/15| credits=Presenters: [[Violent J]], 2 Tuff Tony, and [[Corporal Robinson]]| station=WFKO| airdate=2010-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725115222/http://www.wfuckoffradio.com/wfko.php/shows/15|archivedate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony was reinstated two months later under the conditions that he start at the bottom, receive no title matches for several months, and cannot compete at any ''Bloodymania'' events.&lt;ref name="The Main Event July 20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Main Event March 18"&gt;{{cite episode |title=March 18, 2010|series=The Main Event |url=http://wfuckoffradio.com/wfko.php/shows/15 |credits=Presenters: [[Violent J]], 2 Tuff Tony, and [[Corporal Robinson]] |station=WFKO |airdate=2010-03-18 |minutes= 1:20:50 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328093423/http://www.wfuckoffradio.com/wfko.php/shows/15|archivedate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selwyn Bougard''', now known as '''El-Divine Amir Bey''', better known by his stage name '''4th Disciple''', is a sonic artist and audio engineer who was one of the founding members of [[Killarmy]] and one of the best-known [[List of Wu-Tang Clan affiliates|Wu-Tang-affiliated producers]]. He is the only member of the Wu Elements to have worked on the Clan's first breakthrough album, as a mixer.

== Biography ==
After being a turntablist on the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', 4th Disciple co-produced and helped mix several tracks with the [[RZA]] on the first three Wu-Tang solo ventures by various artists, including co-production for "Sub Crazy" by [[Method Man]], "Damage" by [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] as well as mixing credits for some of [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'', on the tracks "Criminology," "Guillotine (Swordz)," "Spot Rusherz," and "Wu-Gambinos." 4th Disciple then produced what was at the time only the second Wu-Tang track ever to lack a RZA production credit, when the [[Killah Priest]] solo track "B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth)" was included on [[GZA]]'s ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. This led to five 4th Disciple productions appearing on the double album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]''.

After producing 15 of the 17 tracks on Killarmy's debut album, ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]'', and contributing significant production to the debut albums of [[Killah Priest]] (''[[Heavy Mental]]'') and [[Sunz of Man]] (''[[The Last Shall Be First (Sunz of Man album)|The Last Shall be First]]''), 4th Disciple's beats continued to appear on the solo work of the Clan members, including Inspectah Deck and Method Man. However, more recently, 4th Disciple has been concentrating his production on Killarmy, Sunz of Man, and their immediate affiliates rather than the Clan itself. [[The RZA]] did, in fact, produce the tracks "Wake Up" and "War Face" from ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]''

'''''A-Love''''' is a female Australian-based MC from [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]. Her debut album, ''Ace of Hearts'' was nominated 'Best Urban Release' in the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2008]].&lt;ref name="ARIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/documents/2008ARIAAwardFinalistsAnnounced.pdf|title=Emerging Artists dominate 2008 ARIA Award nominations|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|accessdate=18 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221024218/http://aria.com.au/documents/2008ARIAAwardFinalistsAnnounced.pdf| archivedate= 21 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
A-Love was born Antonella Formosa in Rome, Italy on 21 March 1983.  Formosa's father, [[Ric Formosa]], a composer/arranger and an original member (lead guitarist) with the Australian band [[Little River Band]] and her mother, Vicki Formosa, was an [[Rhythm &amp; Blues|R&amp;B]] singer.{{quote|My earliest memories are of my Dad carting me around to different studios to these sessions, and playing on pool tables in old studios.|Antonella Formosa&lt;ref name="3D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threedworld.com.au/music/features/2007/ALove--From-The-Heart/ |title=A-Love from the heart |publisher=3D World|date=3 December 2007|accessdate=18 December 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
She attended [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] Secondary College, graduating in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://namesdatabase.com/people/FORMOSA/ANTONELLA/63056 |title=Formosa, Antonella |publisher=Names Database |accessdate=18 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714151843/http://namesdatabase.com/people/FORMOSA/ANTONELLA/63056 |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst her first experiences of playing music were with an all-girl band, which never made any public performances,&lt;ref name="3D"/&gt; she also discovered hip hop in high school and soon found herself waxing lyrical over beats.{{quote|Rest assured, if I was a better singer, I'd be a soul singer! [MCing] was just something that I fell in love with in my teens. I've always been heavily into lyricism, no matter what kind of musical style I've been interested in. The fact that hip hop let you just not mince words and be really direct and cram so much more content and originality into your lyrics than singing was the biggest thing for me.|Antonella Formosa&lt;ref name="3D"/&gt;}}

In January 2000, Formosa met Draino from the [[Puah Hedz]].  He was keen to check out her writing and despite her reluctance, he made her feature on a track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/ozmusicmonth/s986700.htm  |title=Next Crop Artists (2003) A-Love|publisher=[[Triple J]]|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second track that she had ever recorded was with [[Muph &amp; Plutonic|Muphin]], which later became "Some People" which featured on the album ''Despite the Odds''.&lt;ref name="Heavy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heavyweighttv.com/artists.php?artist=A+-+Love |title=Artist Profile – A-Love |publisher=Heavyweight TV |accessdate=18 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722013050/http://www.heavyweighttv.com/artists.php?artist=A+-+Love |archivedate=22 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since appeared numerous times on [[Triple J]]'s 'The Hip Hop Show', [[3PBS|PBS]]' 'The Formula' (now 'Hittin Switches') and 'Auscultation', [[3RRR|RRR]]'s 'Wordburner' and [[RMIT University]]'s [[Student Youth Network|SRA FM]].  She was progressing towards a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[Anthropology]] from [[La Trobe University]] and for two years she was the co-host of a hip hop radio show at La Trobe University.

May 2002 marked A-Love's official solo introduction to the Australian hip hop and media circles, with her song "Petty" from the album, ''Culture of Kings Volume 2''&lt;ref name="Heavy"/&gt; (the first ever Australian hip hop feature album on Triple J).  "Petty" was put on medium rotation on [[Triple J]].

Formosa was a winner of the [[Nescafe Big Break]] competition in 2002, earning $20,000 with which to start up an independent record label and distribution company, Duality Records. As time progressed, she juggled the twin responsibilities of building a label and working on her own debut as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cache.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=1664302048&amp;page_url=%2f%2fnbb.tekgroup.com.au%2fwinners%2f2002%2fantonella_formosa.asp&amp;page_last_updated=8%2f4%2f2006+5%3a12%3a10+AM&amp;firstName=Antonella&amp;lastName=Formosa|title=Hip Hop Artist's career gets a spin in the right direction|publisher=Zoom Info|date=1 January 2002|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|I really concentrated on getting the admin and strategic side of the label going, but it just proved to be a bit too hard. I knew that it was either gonna be the music that went or the label – which is where we are now.|Antonella Formosa&lt;ref name="3D"/&gt;}}

Formosa released her debut album, ''Ace of Hearts'' on 24 November 2007, on Crookneck Records.  The album was produced by BVA (Mnemonic Ascent) with additional beats from [[Suffa]] ([[Hilltop Hoods]]) and Jase. Guests include [[Yungun]] (UK), Raph (Mnemonic Ascent), [[Spikey Tee]] (UK) and emerging indigenous MC Jim Blah.  It was Triple J's 'Album of the Week' just three days after its release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s2099792.htm |title=A-Love : Ace of Hearts|publisher=Triple J|date=26 November 2007|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for the 2008 [[ARIA Awards]] in the category of 'Best Urban Release'.&lt;ref name="ARIA"/&gt;{{quote|The minute that I stepped in the studio with BVA I knew the time was right to record this album. I felt hungry and inspired again, it all fell in place. The result is a bunch of songs with lasting sentiment; real stories about real life.|Antonella Formosa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jplay.com.au/JSite/ViewArtist.aspx?ArtistID=3400&amp;ShowFullBio=true|title=A-Love @J Play|publisher=J Play|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She was also nominated for two at the [[Jägermeister]] AIR (Australian Independent Record Labels Association) Awards in 2008, in the categories of 'Best New Independent Artist' and 'Best Independent Hip Hop Artist'.&lt;ref name="AIR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airawards.com.au/nominees/nominees-2008 |title=AIR Award Nominees 2008 |publisher=Australian Independent Record Labels Association |accessdate=18 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126082019/http://www.airawards.com.au/nominees/nominees-2008 |archive-date=26 January 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Billboard.biz|title=Yunupingu Wins AIR Awards Triple|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3iebd6a39896504e50fda355ba222fdf10|date=25 November 2008|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A.D.O.R.''', born '''Eddie Castellanos''', is a U.S. hip hop artist whose work includes the [[Pete Rock]]-produced hit "Let It All Hang Out" ([[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], 1992), and "One for the Trouble" (Atlantic, 1994), produced by [[Marley Marl]]. The latter has been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] extensively in later songs, most famously [[Fatboy Slim]]'s 1998 remix of "Renegade Master" by [[Roger McKenzie|Roger "Wildchild" MacKenzie]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Castellanos was born in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights, New York City]]. His father was a musician by profession, and as a child Castellanos attended his shows. At six years of age he moved with his family to [[Mount Vernon, New York]], later to be known in hip hop circles as "money earnin' Mount Vernon" due to the preponderance of rap stars it produced.The future A.D.O.R. went to high school there, where he met [[Sean Combs]], [[Heavy D]], Al B. Sure, and [[Pete Rock]]. Becoming interested in hip hop, he took the name A.D.O.R. (standing for both Another Dimension of Rhythm and A Declaration Of A Revolution). Sean Combs, by this time working at [[Uptown Records]], began presenting A.D.O.R.'s demo tapes to record companies. Heavy D's DJ, DJ Eddie F, secured him a management and production deal. In 1992 he recorded his first record, the single "Let It All Hang Out", for [[Atlantic Records]].&lt;ref name=am1/&gt;

==="Let It All Hang Out"===
The musical backing for A.D.O.R.'s raps on "Let It All Hang Out" was by his old friend Pete Rock, by 1992 already an acclaimed producer, and now commonly cited as one of the hip hop genre's best. Stanton Swihart of [[allmusic]] describes the track as an "infectious" outing that was an "instant classic" on release, driven by Rock's "irresistible horn loop" and the "tight flow" of A.D.O.R.'s rhymes. A hit in the summer of 1992, for Swihart its qualities have now proved timeless.&lt;ref name=am1&gt;Stanton Swihart. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:difyxqlhldke~T1 A.D.O.R. Biography]", allmusic, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=am2&gt;Stanton Swihart. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gbfpxqwjldse A.D.O.R.: Shock Therapy]", allmusic, undated.&lt;/ref&gt; HipHopDX calls "Let It All Hang Out" "a certifiable Pete Rock classic", with "delicious horns" that no other producer could emulate.&lt;ref name=dx&gt;J-22. "[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/reviews/id.370 A.D.O.R. - Classic Bangerz]", hiphopdx, January 19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Though most critical commentary focuses on the production, the rapper's contribution is roundly praised; Steve Juon of RapReviews notes in particular that the record established A.D.O.R.'s distinctive, high-pitched register.&lt;ref name=juon&gt;Steve Juon. "[http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2003_12_bangerzv1.html A.D.O.R. :: Classic Bangerz Volume 1 :: Tru Reign Records ] rapreviews, December 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="One for the Trouble" and ''The Concrete''===
A.D.O.R. toured with major acts and made television appearances building on the buzz created by "Let It All Hang Out". In 1994 he followed up with a second single, "One for the Trouble", produced by K-Def and the legendary Queensbridge producer [[Marley Marl]]. This record provided the "back once again with the ill behaviour" vocal snippet which dominates [[Fatboy Slim]]'s 1998 hit remix of "Renegade Master" by [[Roger McKenzie|Wildchild]]. "One for the Trouble" signaled  that plans were underway for a debut album on Atlantic titled ''The Concrete''. Despite his successful run at the major label, A.D.O.R. was let go from his contract with Atlantic in 1995 without ''The Concrete'' being released, reportedly because of disputes over creative decisions, even though promotional items were released and the catalogue number 82443 was assigned to the release.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;Gabrielle Schafer. "[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ador/articles/story/5927916/tru_reign_signs_deal_with_sumthing_distribution Tru Reign Signs Deal With Sumthing Distribution ]", ''Rolling Stone'', January 6, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tru Reign: ''Shock Therapy''===
A.D.O.R. formed his own record company in 1996: Tru Reign Records. For his fledgling label he immediately recorded and released as a single another Pete Rock track, "Enter the Center". It was a successful venture. Stanton reports that it sold "remarkably well" given its independent, small scale distribution, and received heavy radio play.&lt;ref name=am1/&gt; He considers it the equal of its predecessor "Let It All Hang Out", but Juon goes further, offering that both Rock and Castellanos had improved their respective techniques in the six years between the two tracks. He draws attention to a new-found depth in the lyrical content of A.D.O.R.'s rap, putting this advancement down to maturity and experience in the later record.&lt;ref name=juon/&gt; HipHopDX's reviewer found in "Enter the Center" "more of Pete Rock's understated brilliance".&lt;ref name=dx/&gt; A.D.O.R.'s singles to date were collected on his debut album for Tru Reign, ''Shock Frequency'' (1998). Rock and Marley Marl were joined there by [[Diamond D]] and [[DJ Clark Kent|Clark Kent]], making an impressive roster. "Shock to Bliss" and "Shock Frequency" were reminiscent of Rock's cuts, and almost as good, and Kent's contribution "From the Concrete" completed the album's highlights. The record as a whole betrayed its 1992 roots, though reviewers found this was not a bad thing, even if it did mean that it seemed to lack relevance or urgency in the musical climate of 1998.&lt;ref name=am2/&gt;

===''Classic Bangerz'', ''The Signature of the Ill'', and beyond===
In January 2000, Tru Reign secured a distribution deal with [[Nile Rodgers]]' company Sumpthing Distribution. By this time, A.D.O.R.'s roster at Tru Reign also included artists K The Terrorbull, Nappy Redd &amp; Filthy Rich, and Cristal Lane.&lt;ref name=stone/&gt; A.D.O.R. released the album ''Animal 2000'' in this year. All was quiet until 2003, when he reemerged with the compilation ''Classic Bangers, Vol. 1'', and then an album of new music, ''Signature of the Ill'', in 2005. Both were received favorably by critics, yet the praise was again qualified as it had been with ''Shock Frequency''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s reception: the compilation of old material (which mined ''Shock Frequency'' heavily) ''and'' the collection of new music both seemed throwbacks to simpler times, with lyrics that concentrated on fun and a smooth flow rather than the trickery and internal or polysyllabic rhyme schemes of virtuoso rappers following in the wake of [[Biggie]] or [[Big Pun|Pun]].&lt;ref name=dx/&gt;&lt;ref name=juon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Teufel . "
For the song, Step Up. Castellanos hired Producer and Director Ronald Farnham to make the music video, which was shot in Tampa, Florida.

}}'''''After Man: A Zoology of the Future''''' is a 1981 [[speculative evolution]] book written by Scottish geologist [[Dougal Dixon]] and illustrated by several illustrators including Diz Wallis, John Butler, Brian McIntyre, Philip Hood, Roy Woodard and Gary Marsh. The book also features a foreword by [[Desmond Morris]]. ''After Man'' explores a hypothetical future set 50 million years from now, a time period Dixon dubs the "Posthomic", which is inhabited by animals that have [[Evolution|evolved]] from survivors of a [[mass extinction]] succeeding our own time.

''After Man'' used a fictional setting and hypothetical animals to explain the natural processes behind evolution, a concept that proved successful. The success of ''After Man'' spawned two following speculative evolution books (sometimes called the "''After'' trilogy"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite interview|last=Naish|first=Darren|title=Of After Man, The New Dinosaurs and Greenworld: an interview with Dougal Dixon|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/of-after-man-the-new-dinosaurs-and-greenworld-an-interview-with-dougal-dixon/|access-date=2018-09-21|work=Scientific American Blog Network|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which used new fictional settings and creatures to explain other natural processes. ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'', released in 1988, explained the concept of [[zoogeography]] and [[biogeographic realm]]s through a world in which the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never happened and [[non-avian dinosaurs]] were still alive. ''[[Man After Man]]'', released in 1990, focused on [[climate change]] over the next few million years through the eyes of future human species [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to adapt to it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/30/speculative-biology-understanding-the-past-and-predicting-our-future|title=Speculative biology: understanding the past and predicting our future|last=Lydon|first=Susannah|date=2018-05-30|work=the Guardian|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''After Man'' and Dixon's following books inspired the speculative evolution artistic movement which focuses on speculative scenarios in the evolution of life, often possible future scenarios (such as ''After Man'') or alternative paths in the past (such as ''The New Dinosaurs''). Dixon is often considered the founder of the modern speculative evolution movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/9/17437644/after-man-new-edition-evolution-humanity-extinction-dougal-dixon-interview-speculative-biology|title=This book imagines what animals might look like if humans went extinct|last1=Potenza|first1=Alessandra|website=The Verge|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
[[File:World After Man.jpg|left|thumb|Map of the continents in ''After Man'', having experienced 50 million years of [[continental drift]] since the present day]]
''After Man'' explores Earth 50 million years in the future, hypothesizing what new animals might evolve in the timespan between its setting and the present day. Ecology and evolutionary theory are applied to create believable creatures, all of which have their own binomial names and text describing their behaviour and interactions with other contemporary animals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In this new period of the [[Cenozoic]], which Dixon calls the "Posthomic", [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] have [[African Plate|fused]], closing the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; whereas [[Asia]] and [[North America]] has collided and closed the [[Bering Strait]]; [[South America]] has split from [[Central America]]; [[Australia]] has collided with [[Southern Asia]] (colliding with the mainland sometime in the last 10 million years), uplifting a mountain range beyond the mountains of the [[Far East]] that has become the most extensive and the highest chain in the world, greater even than the [[Himalayas]] at their zenith 50 million years ago; and parts of eastern Africa have [[East African Rift|split off]] to form a new island called [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]. Other volcanic islands have been added, such as the Pacaus [[archipelago]] and Batavia.

Over a hundred future animal species are described and illustrated in the book. Major groups include the "rabbucks", versatile descendants of rabbits filling the ecological niches of [[deer]], [[zebra]]s, [[giraffe]]s and [[antelope]], "gigantelopes", descendants of antelope filling niche held by [[African bush elephant|elephants]], [[giraffes]], [[moose]], [[musk oxen]], [[rhinoceroses]], and other large herbivores and the [[Predation|predatory]] rats, the major group of terrestrial predators and descendants of rats.

== Development ==
As a child, Dixon was inspired by [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]'', particularly the far future creatures featured in the book, to create his own imaginary future animals descended from creatures of the modern day. These animals often served as background characters in Dixon's own retellings of Wells' work. In the 1960s, Dixon was influenced by the contemporary conservationist movements, especially a campaign to save the [[tiger]]s. Dixon began to ponder that should the tiger and other endangered animals go extinct, something would inevitably take their place. After seeing a "Save the Whale" badge on a friend in the late 1970s, the idea materialized again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dixon devised ''After Man'' as a popular-level book on the processes of evolution that instead of using the past to tell the story projected the processes into the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After finishing a dummy version of the book, with text and his own illustrations, Dixon took the book to two different publishers in London, both of whom immediately greenlit the project.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tetzoo.com/blog/2018/9/16/the-dougal-dixon-iafter-mani-event-of-september-2018|title=The Dougal Dixon  After Man  Event of September 2018|work=Tetrapod Zoology Podcast|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When designing the various animals of the book, Dixon looked at the different types of biomes on the planet and what adaptations animals living there have, designing new animals descended from modern day ones with the same set of adaptations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though Dixon made illustrations of his future animals to pitch the project, the final book used illustrations by other artists due to a publisher decision. Dixon created detailed illustrations that the artists followed in the creation of the final artwork featured in ''After Man''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In March 2018, Breakdown Press published a new edition of the book, updated to reflect modern science relating to evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The updated version also features new artwork for some of the animals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The first review of ''After Man'' was one made by Professor Barry Cox of [[King's College London]] in a science-based radio programme. Cox's review was extremely negative, but subsequent reviews were highly positive. Reviews in ''[[New Scientist]]'' and ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' praised the book and Dixon went on [[Publicity Tour|publicity tours]] in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''After Man'' was at the time of its release portrayed in reviews as a book about the extinction of mankind, though Dixon has stated that mankind's end was simply an excuse to discuss evolution, humanity having very little do with the "plot" of the book.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1982, the book was a finalist for the [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work]].&lt;ref name="Hugo82"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1982-hugo-awards/|title=1982 Hugo Awards|publisher=World Science Fiction Society|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVVDaIgM?url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1982-hugo-awards/|archivedate=2011-05-07|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
Following the success of ''After Man'', Dixon realized that there was a market for popular-level books which use fictional examples and settings to explain actual factual scientific processes. ''After Man'' had explained the process of evolution by creating a complex hypothetical future ecosystem, the "sequel" ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'' (1988) was instead aimed at creating a book on [[zoogeography]], a subject the general public was quite unfamiliar with, by using a fictional world in which the [[non-avian dinosaurs]] had not gone extinct to explain the process. ''The New Dinosaurs'' was followed by another project in 1990, ''[[Man After Man]]'', which focused on the future evolution of humanity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Japanese markets were highly interested in ''After Man'', and Japanese adaptations were made of the book, including both a [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] documentary and an [[Animation|animated]] film.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To date, Dixon's 2010 speculative evolution book ''Greenworld'', exploring humanity's impact on an alien ecosystem, has only been published in Japan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''[[The Future Is Wild|The Future is Wild]]'', a 2002 miniseries, features future animals evolving over the course of several million years. Early in its development, Dixon was brought in as a consultant. Dixon designed many of the creatures featured in the programme, some of which are similar to creatures in ''After Man'' (such as the "gannetwhale", a bird similar to the whale-like penguins of ''After Man''), and co-authored the companion book with the producer of the series, John Adams. ''The Future is Wild'' also focused considerably on future environmental changes, something Dixon avoided in ''After Man'' so that readers would at the very least recognize the background inhabited by the various future animals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''The Future is Wild'' was unable to use Dixon's original creatures as [[DreamWorks SKG]] had bought and owned the rights to ''After Man''. DreamWorks eventually abandoned the project, and the rights were then bought by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], though no potential movie adaptation has yet materialized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Apparent death''', colloquially known as '''playing dead''', '''feigning death''', or '''playing possum''', is a behavior in which animals take on the appearance of being [[death|dead]].  This form of [[Deception in animals|animal deception]] is an [[adaptive behavior]] also known as '''tonic immobility''' or '''thanatosis'''.  Apparent death can be used as a [[Antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]] or as a form of [[aggressive mimicry]], and occurs in a wide range of animals.

When induced by humans, the state is sometimes colloquially known as '''animal hypnosis'''.  According to Gilman et al.,&lt;ref name="Gilman et al., 1950"&gt;Gilman, T.T., Marcuse, F.L. and Moore, A.U., (1960). Animal hypnosis: a study of the induction of tonic immobility in chickens. Journal of Comparative Physiology and Psychology, 43: 99-111&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation of "animal hypnosis" dates back to the year 1646 in a report by [[Athanasius Kircher]].

Tonic immobility (TI) is a behaviour in which some animals become apparently temporarily [[paralysed]] and unresponsive to external stimuli.  In most cases, this occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a (perceived) predator, although in [[sharks]] exhibiting the behaviour, some scientists relate it to mating, arguing that biting by the male immobilizes the female and thus facilitates mating.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"&gt;Henningsen, A.D., (1994).  Tonic immobility in 12 elasmobranchs - use as an aid in captive husbandry. Zoo Biology 13: 325-332. {{doi|10.1002/zoo.1430130406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite appearances, the animal remains conscious throughout tonic immobility.&lt;ref name="Jones 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, R.B|title=The tonic immobility reaction of the domestic fowl: a review|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=42|issue=1|year=1986|pages=82–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this includes the occasional responsive movement, scanning of the environment and animals in TI often taking advantage of escape opportunities.

===In sharks===
Some sharks can be induced into tonic immobility by inverting them and restraining them by hand, e.g. [[dogfish sharks]], [[lemon shark]]s, [[whitetip reef shark]]s.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watsky, M.A., and Gruber, S.H. (1990) Induction and duration of tonic immobility in the lemon shark, ''Negaprion brevirostris''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 8: 207-210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davie, P.S., Franklin, C.E., and Grigg, G.C. (1993) Blood pressure and heart rate during tonic immobility in the black tipped reef shark, ''Carcharhinus melanoptera''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 12: 95-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[tiger shark]]s (measuring 3–4 metres in length), tonic immobility can be induced by humans placing their hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding the eyes. During tonic immobility in sharks, the dorsal fins straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed. This state persists for an average of 15 minutes before recovery and the resumption of active behaviour.  Scientists have exploited this response to study shark behaviour; chemical [[shark repellent]] has been studied to test its effectiveness and to more accurately estimate dose sizes, concentrations and time to recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tonic immobility|website=Shark defense: Chemical repellents|url=http://www.sharkdefense.com/Repellents/Tonic_Immobility/tonic_immobility.html|accessdate=January 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tonic immobility can also be used as a form of mild anesthesia during experimental manipulations of sharks.&lt;ref&gt;Heithaus, M.R., Dill, L.M., Marshall, G.J., and Buhleier, B. (2002) Habitat use and foraging behavior of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in a seagrass ecosystem. Marine Biology 140: 237-248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, K.N., Wetherbee, B.M., owe, C.G., and Meyer, C.G. (1999) Movements of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in coastal Hawaiian waters. Marine Biology 134: 665-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists also believe that tonic immobility can be a stressful experience for sharks. By measuring blood chemistry samples when the shark is immobile, it has been suggested that tonic immobility can actually put stress on the shark, and reduce breathing efficiency. However, it has also been proposed that sharks have a series of compensatory mechanisms that work to increase respiration rates and lower stress.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, E. J., et al. "The Stress Physiology of Extended Duration Tonic Immobility in the Juvenile Lemon Shark, Negaprion Brevirostris (Poey 1868)." Journal of experimental marine biology and ecology 409.1-2 (2011): 351-60. SCOPUS. Web. 22 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that orcas can exploit sharks' tonic immobility to prey on large sharks. Some orcas ram sharks from the side to stun them, then flip the sharks to induce tonic immobility and keep them in such state for sustained time. For some sharks, this prevents water from flowing through their gills and the result can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lauren Smith|title=Orcas vs great white sharks: in a battle of the apex predators who wins?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/nov/16/orca-whales-vs-great-white-sharks-in-a-battle-of-the-apex-predators-who-wins|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In teleost fishes===
[[Goldfish]], [[trout]], [[rudd]], [[tench]], [[brown bullhead]], [[medaka]], [[paradise fish]], and [[topminnow]] have been reported to go limp when they are restrained on their backs.&lt;ref&gt;Table 2 in: Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt; [[oscar (fish)|Oscars]] seem to go into shock when they are stressed (when their aquarium is being cleaned, for example): they lie on their side, stop moving their fins, start to breathe more slowly and deeply, and lose colour.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, F.T. (1977) Induction and duration of tonic immobility. The Psychological Record 27: 89-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar behavior has been reported for [[convict tang]]s in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, J.C. (1991) Field observations of death feigning in the convict tang, ''Acanthurus triostegus'' (Linnaeus), with comments on the nocturnal color pattern in juvenile specimens. Journal of Aquariculture and Aquatic Sciences 6: 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In marine mammals===
In 1997, it was reported that around the [[Farallon Islands]] off the coast of [[California]], a female [[orca]] was seen apparently inducing tonic immobility in a [[great white shark]]. The orca held the shark upside down to induce TI and kept the shark still for 15 minutes, causing it to suffocate to death.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This was the first recorded case of predation on a great white shark in the wild by a species other than humans.

Another case of orcas apparently inducing TI has been observed with [[stingrays]] in [[New Zealand]]. In this context, the orcas turn themselves upside down before attacking, trap the stingrays in their mouths then quickly right themselves.  This inverts the stingray, thereby inducing TI, rendering the fish helpless and an easy meal.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Channel "The Whale That Ate Jaws" 11/29/2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===In reptiles===
Tonic immobility can be reliably induced in [[iguana]]s by a combination of inversion, restraint and moderate pressure. During TI, there are obvious changes in respiration including a decline in respiration rate, the rhythm becomes sporadic, and the magnitude irregular.  The prolonged period of TI does not seem to be consistent with the fear hypothesis, but could be the result of a period of cortical depression due to increased brain stem activity.&lt;ref name="Prestrude"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Prestrude, A.M.  |author2=Crawford, F.T.|title=Tonic immobility in the lizard, iguana iguana|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=18|issue=2|year=1970|pages=391–395|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(70)80052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonic immobility can also be induced in the [[Carolina anole]].  The characteristics of this TI vary as a function of the duration and condition of captivity.&lt;ref name="Hennig"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tonic immobility in Anolis carolinensis: Effects of time and conditions of captivity|year=1978|journal=Behavioral Biology|author1=Hennig, C.W  |author2=Dunlap, W.P.|volume=23|issue=1|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/s0091-6773(78)91180-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In rabbits===
In [[rabbit]]s, the physiological and behavioral responses to induced tonic immobility have been found to be indicative of a fear-motivated stress state. Tonic immobility is considered a last attempt for prey to escape being eaten by a predator. A 2006 study concluded that rabbits show symptoms that are in line with being stressed after being in a tonic immobility state, such as a faster heart rate and breathing.&lt;ref name="McBride et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBride |first1=Anne |year=2006 |title=Trancing rabbits: Relaxed hypnosis or a state of fear? |journal=Proceedings of the VDWE International Congress on Companion Animal Behaviour and Welfare |volume= |issue= |pages=135–137 |doi= |url= http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/54860 |accessdate=September 2, 2013|display-authors=etal}} (downloadable .doc file). • Click [http://www.hopperhome.com/Trancing%20Rabbits-Tonic%20Immobility%20.pdf here] for PDF copy from hopperhome.com.&lt;/ref&gt; This confirms that the promotion of tonic immobility to increase a bond between rabbits and their owners – holding the rabbit on its back and thinking the rabbits enjoy it – is misplaced; however, the researchers concluded that inducing tonic immobility in rabbits is appropriate for certain veterinary procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.&lt;ref name="McBride et al." /&gt;

===In humans===
Tonic immobility has been hypothesized to occur in humans undergoing intense trauma, including sexual assault. While "freezing" in response to life-threatening situations is well-known, the common "freeze" response exhibited by victims of rape is often misunderstood as passive consent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/proceedings/20/galliano.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/23/why-many-rape-victims-dont-fight-or-yell/ Why many rape victims don’t fight or yell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

There is also an increasing body of evidence that points to a positive contribution of tonic immobility in human functioning. Thus, defensive immobilization is hypothesized to have played a critical role in the evolution of human parent-child attachment&lt;ref name=Porges&gt;{{cite journal | author = Porges S W | year = 2003 | title =  Social engagement and attachment: a phylogenetic perspective | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1008 | issue = 1| pages = 31-47 | doi=10.1196/annals.1301.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sustained attention and suggestibility,&lt;ref name="Hoskovec, J., &amp; Svorad, D. 1969 pp. 180-182"&gt;{{cite journal | title= The relationship between human and animal hypnosis |year=1969 |last1=Hoskovec |first1=J |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=180-182 |last2=Svorad |first2=D |doi= 10.1080/00029157.1969.10402029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortez, C.

===As a scientific tool===
Tonic immobility is considered to be a fear-potentiated response induced by physical restraint and characterised by reduced responsiveness to external stimulation.  It has been used as a measure in the assessment of animal welfare, particularly hens, since 1970.&lt;ref name="Gallup et al., 1970"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., Nash, R.F., Potter, R.J. and Donegan, N.H., (1970). Effect of varying conditions of fear on immobility reactions in domestic chickens (Gallus gullus).  Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 73: 442-445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallup, 1979"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., (1979).  Tonic immobility as a measure of fear in the domestic fowl.  Animal Behaviour, 27: 316-317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"&gt;Jones, B. and Faure, J.M. (1981). Tonic immobility ("righting time") in laying hens housed in cages and pens. Applied Animal Ethology 7: 369-372&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the TI test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting the anti-predator response. The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death-feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; TI in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.&lt;ref name="Forkman et al., 2007"&gt;Forkman, B., Boissy, A. Meunier-Salaün, M.-C. Canali, E. and Jones, R.B., (2007). A critical review of fear tests used on cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry and horses.  Physiology &amp; Behavior, 92: 340-374&lt;/ref&gt;

To induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds.  This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’- or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck.&lt;ref name="Zamudio et al., 2009"&gt;Zamudio, S.R., Quevedo-Corona, L., Garcés, L. and De La Cruz, F. (2009).  The effects of acute stress and acute corticosterone administration on the immobility response in rats.  Brain Research Bulletin, 80: 331-336&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15-second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’.

Tonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens,&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"/&gt; hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels,&lt;ref name="Jones, 1987"&gt;Jones, R.B., (1987).

Fear levels in laying hens carried by hand and by mechanical conveyors.

In [[ethology|animal behaviour]], thanatosis (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|θανάτωσις}}, meaning "putting to death"; ''[[cf. ]]'': [[Thanatos]]) is the process by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a [[prey]] evading a [[predator]], a male trying to [[mating|mate]] with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The [[French people|French]] biologist [[Georges Pasteur]] classifies it as a form of ''self-mimesis'', a form of [[camouflage]] or [[mimicry]] in which the "mimic" imitates itself in a dead state.&lt;ref name=Pasteur /&gt;

===For defense===
For defensive purposes, thanatosis hinges on the pursuer's becoming unresponsive to its victim, as most predators only catch live prey.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;Pasteur, G. (1982). "[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 A classificatory review of mimicry systems]". ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''13''': 169–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced,&lt;ref name="beetle"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Miyatake|first1 = T|last2 = Katayama|first2 = K.|last3 = Takeda|first3 = Y.|last4 = Nakashima|first4 = A.|last5 = Mizumoto|first5 = M.|year = 2004|title = Is death-feigning adaptive? Heritable variation in fitness difference of death-feigning behaviour|journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume = 271|pages = 2293–2296|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2858|pmid=15539355|last6=Mizumoto|first6=M|issue=1554|pmc=1691851|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that thanatosis is indeed adaptive.

In the [[Hognose|hog-nosed snake]], a threatened individual rolls onto its back and appears to be dead when threatened by a predator, while a foul-smelling, volatile fluid oozes from its body. Predators, such as [[cat]]s, then lose interest in the snake, which both looks and smells dead. One reason for their loss of interest is that rotten-smelling animals are avoided as a precaution against infectious disease, so the snake is, in this case, exploiting that reaction. Newly hatched young also instinctively show this behaviour when [[rat]]s try to eat them.&lt;ref&gt;''Triumph of Life'' (2006). Alexandria, VA: PBS Home Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, the [[Virginia opossum]] is perhaps the best known example of defensive thanatosis. "[[wikt:play possum|Playing possum]]" is an idiomatic phrase which means "pretending to be dead".&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book|title =The Chambers Dictionary|publisher =Allied Publishers|year =1998|page=1279|isbn =978-81-86062-25-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Francq|first = E.|year = 1969|title = Behavioural aspects of feigned death in the opossum ''Didelphis marsupialis''|journal = American Midland Naturalist|volume = 81|pages = 556–568|doi = 10.2307/2423988|issue = 2|jstor = 2423988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |title=Playing Possum |publisher=Wonderful West Virginia |author=Ann Bailey Dunn |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001110406/http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[instinct]] does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging [[roadkill]] may use it in response to the threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves.&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/wildlife/index.php?subject=Mammals&amp;id=71|title=Virginia Opossum|publisher=Mass Audubon|accessdate=May 11, 2011|quote=Opossums are frequently encountered as corpses along highways.

Others believe that the opossums’ small brain (5 times smaller than that of a raccoon) suggests that they may just be too dumb to get out of the way of vehicles!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual advice for humans attempting to survive an attack by a [[brown bear]] is to lie face down, cover the face with ones hands/arms/elbows, and 'play dead'; hopefully the bear will get bored and wander away after a while.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/stories/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack&lt;/ref&gt;

"Playing possum" can also mean simply pretending to be injured, [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], [[asleep]], or otherwise vulnerable, often to lure an opponent into a vulnerable position him or herself.&lt;ref name="dict"/&gt;

Thanatosis has also been observed in some invertebrates such as the wasp ''[[Nasonia vitripennis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = King|first = B.|author2=H. Leaich |year = 2006|title = Variation in propensity to exhibit thanatosis in ''Nasonia vitripennis'' (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)|journal = Journal of Insect Behaviour|volume = 19|issue = 2|pages = 241–249|doi = 10.1007/s10905-006-9022-7|citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.3100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cricket, ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Nishino|first = H.|year = 2004|title = Motor output characterizing thanatosis in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus|journal = Journal of Experimental Behaviour|volume =207|issue = 22|pages = 3899–3915|doi=10.1242/jeb.01220|pmid = 15472021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For reproduction===
In the spider species ''[[Pisaura mirabilis]]'', male spiders often stage elaborate rituals of [[Nuptial gift (animal behavior)|gift-giving]] and thanatosis to avoid getting eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less.&lt;ref name="spider"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Line Spinner Hansen |author2=Sofia Fernandez Gonzales |author3=Søren Toft |author4=Trine Bilde |year=2008|title=Thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider ''Pisaura mirabilis''|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=19 |issue=3|pages=546–551|doi=10.1093/beheco/arm165|url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/546.full|accessdate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For predation===
''[[Nimbochromis]]'' (sleeper cichlids), [[endemic]] to [[Lake Malawi]] in [[East Africa]], are large predatory fish for whom thanatosis is a form of aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. ''N. livingstoni'' then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close.&lt;ref name="fish"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gene S.

'''Artificial life''' (often abbreviated '''ALife''' or '''A-Life''') is a field of study wherein researchers examine [[system]]s related to natural [[life]], its processes, and its evolution, through the use of [[simulation]]s with [[computer models]], [[robotics]], and [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/artificial%20life|title=Dictionary.com definition|accessdate=2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline was named by [[Christopher Langton]], an American theoretical biologist, in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;cd=1#v=onepage The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences], The MIT Press, p.37. {{ISBN|978-0-262-73144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main kinds of alife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/~mab/publications/papers/BedauTICS03.pdf|title=Artificial life: organization, adaptation and complexity from the bottom up|author=Mark A.

== Overview ==
Artificial life studies the fundamental processes of [[living system]]s in artificial environments in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex information processing that define such systems.  These topics are broad, but often include [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary dynamics]], [[Emergence|emergent properties of collective systems]], [[Biomimetics|biomimicry]], as well as related issues about the [[Philosophy of biology|philosophy of the nature of life]] and the use of lifelike properties in artistic works.

== Philosophy ==

The modeling philosophy of artificial life strongly differs from traditional modeling by studying not only "life-as-we-know-it" but also "life-as-it-might-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Langton, C. G. 1992. [http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf Artificial Life] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225322/http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf |date=March 11, 2007 }}. Addison-Wesley. ., section 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation. The simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new and different lifelike systems.

Vladimir Georgievich Red'ko proposed to generalize this distinction to the modeling of any process, leading to the more general distinction of "processes-as-we-know-them" and "processes-as-they-could-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Red'ko, V. G. 1999. [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MATHME.html Mathematical Modeling of Evolution]. in: F. Heylighen, C. Joslyn and V. Turchin (editors): Principia Cybernetica Web (Principia Cybernetica, Brussels). For the importance of ALife modeling from a cosmic perspective, see also Vidal, C. 2008.[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1087 The Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial Cosmogenesis]. In Death And Anti-Death, ed. Charles Tandy, 6: Thirty Years After Kurt Gödel (1906-1978) p. 285-318. Ria University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the commonly accepted [[Life#Definitions|definition of life]] does not consider any current alife simulations or [[software]] to be alive, and they do not constitute part of the evolutionary process of any [[ecosystem]]. However, different opinions about artificial life's potential have arisen:

* The ''strong alife'' (cf. [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|Strong AI]]) position states that "life is a process which can be abstracted away from any particular medium" ([[John von Neumann]]) {{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=There seems to be no original source for this quote, and in fact if you restrict a web search to pages that don't contain the phrase artificial life, there are only a handful left.}}. Notably, [[Thomas S. Ray|Tom Ray]] declared that his program [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] is not simulating life in a computer but synthesizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas S. Ray|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=C. C.|editor2-last=Farmer|editor2-first=J. D.|editor3-last=Rasmussen|editor3-first=S|title=An approach to the synthesis of life|journal=Artificial Life II, Santa Fe Institute Studies in the Sciences of Complexity|date=1991|volume=XI|pages=371–408|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Redwood City, CA|language=English|quote=The intent of this work is to synthesize rather than simulate life.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711051305/http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|archivedate=2015-07-11|accessdate=24 January 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''weak alife'' position denies the possibility of generating a "living process" outside of a chemical solution. Its researchers try instead to simulate life processes to understand the underlying mechanics of biological phenomena.

==Software-based ("soft")==

=== Techniques ===
*[[cellular automaton|Cellular automata]] were used in the early days of artificial life, and are still often used for ease of [[scalability]] and [[parallelization]].  Alife and cellular automata share a closely tied history.
*[[Artificial neural network]]s are sometimes used to model the brain of an agent.  Although traditionally more of an [[artificial intelligence]] technique, neural nets can be important for simulating [[population dynamics]] of organisms that can ''learn''.  The symbiosis between learning and evolution is central to theories about the development of instincts in organisms with higher neurological complexity, as in, for instance, the [[Baldwin effect]].

====Program-based====
{{Further|programming game}}
Program-based simulations contain organisms with a complex DNA language, usually [[Turing complete]].  This language is more often in the form of a computer program than actual biological DNA.  Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. An organism "lives" when its code is executed, and there are usually various methods allowing [[self-replication]]. Mutations are generally implemented as random changes to the code. Use of [[cellular automata]] is common but not required. Another example could be an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent system/program]].

====Module-based====
Individual modules are added to a creature.  These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion).  Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.

====Parameter-based====
Organisms are generally constructed with pre-defined and fixed behaviors that are controlled by various parameters that mutate.  That is, each organism contains a collection of numbers or other ''finite'' parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well-defined way.

====Neural net–based====
These simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural nets or a close derivative.  Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers  use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

==Hardware-based ("hard")==
{{Further|Robot}}
Hardware-based artificial life mainly consist of ''robots'', that is, [[automation|automatically]] guided [[machine]]s able to do tasks on their own.

==Biochemical-based ("wet")==
{{Further|Synthetic biology}}
Biochemical-based life is studied in the field of [[synthetic biology]]. It involves e.g. the creation of [[synthetic DNA]]. The term "wet" is an extension of the term "[[wetware (brain)|wetware]]".

==Early life and education==
De Grey was born and brought up in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/06/14/372618/index.htm |title=This Man Would Have You Live A Really, Really, Really, Really Long Time.

[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/healthandwellbeing.genetics Holding back the years], ''The Observer'', 16 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at [[Sussex House School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sussexhouseschool.co.uk/main_pages/aboutUs.html |title=About Us |publisher=[[Sussex House School]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009191353/http://www.sussexhouseschool.co.uk/main_pages/aboutUs.html |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harrow School]]. He attended the [[University of Cambridge]], and studied at its constituent college of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]]. He graduated with a BA in computer science in 1985.&lt;ref name=executive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sens.org/about/leadership/executive-team|title=Executive Team|work=sens.org|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduation in 1985, de Grey joined [[Sinclair Research Ltd]] as an [[artificial intelligence]] and software engineer. In 1986, he cofounded Man-Made Minions Ltd to pursue the development of an automated [[formal verification|formal program verifier]]. At a graduate party in Cambridge, De Grey met [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] geneticist [[Adelaide Carpenter]] whom he would later marry. Through her he was introduced to the intersection of biology and programming when her boss needed someone who knew about computers and biology to take over the running of a database on fruit flies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mprize.org/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&amp;ID=044 Aubrey de Grey], Methuselah Foundation, accessed 9 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He educated himself in biology by reading journals and textbooks, attending conferences, and being tutored by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/healthandwellbeing.genetics|title=Tom Templeton on biomedical theorist Aubrey de Grey|author=Tom Templeton|work=the Guardian|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-01/prophet-immortality|title=The Prophet of Immortality|work=Popular Science|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1992 to 2006, he was in charge of software development at the university's Genetics Department for the [[FlyBase]] [[genetics|genetic]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Cambridge awarded de Grey a PhD in biology on 9 December 2000.&lt;ref name=executive/&gt;&lt;ref name=camreporter&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2000-01/weekly/5831/27.html Congregation of the Regent House on 9 December 2000], [[Cambridge University Reporter]], 13 December 2000.  [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/gradstud/exams/higher/special.pdf Special regulations] available only to Cambridge degree holders (of whatever discipline) permit the submission of  "...a significant contribution to scholarship" instead. Though the awardee has not been registered as a PhD student, the degree is not honorary; applicants are evaluated by the usual methods, with examiners appointed and an oral defense of the submitted work.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree was based on his 1999 book ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging'', in which de Grey wrote that obviating damage to mitochondrial DNA might by itself extend lifespan significantly, though he said it was more likely that cumulative damage to [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] is a significant cause of senescence, but not the single dominant cause.

===Strategies===
De Grey argues that most of the fundamental knowledge needed to develop effective anti-aging medicine already exists, and that the science is ahead of the funding. He works to identify and promote specific technological approaches to the reversal of various aspects of aging, or, as de Grey puts it, "... the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us."&lt;ref name="050411_aubrey_interview.html"/&gt;

{{As of|2005}}, his work centered on a detailed plan called Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), which is aimed at preventing age-related physical and cognitive decline. In March 2009, he cofounded the [[SENS Research Foundation]] (named SENS Foundation until early 2013), a non-profit organisation based in California, United States, where he currently serves as Chief Science Officer. The Foundation "works to develop, promote and ensure widespread access to regenerative medicine solutions to the disabilities and diseases of aging,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sens.org/sens-foundation/brief-history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222223643/http://www.sens.org/sens-foundation/brief-history|date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence. Before March 2009, the SENS research program was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], cofounded by de Grey.

A major activity of the Methuselah Foundation is the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mprize.org|title=Methuselah Foundation|work=mprize.org|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prize designed to incentivize research into effective life extension interventions by awarding monetary prizes to researchers who stretch the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths. De Grey stated in March 2005 "if we are to bring about real regenerative therapies that will benefit not just future generations, but those of us who are alive today, we must encourage scientists to work on the problem of aging." The prize reached 4.2 [[United States dollar|USD]] million in February 2007.

In 2005, he was the subject of two highly critical editorials accompanying an article in ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''.&lt;ref name=NulandFebr2005&gt;Nuland, Sherwin. February 2005. "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/14147/ Do You Want to Live Forever?]" ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, de Grey wrote the book ''[[Ending Aging]]'' with the assistance of Michael Rae.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael. September 2007. ''[[Ending Aging]]: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime''. New York, NY: Saint Martin's Press, 416 p. {{ISBN|0-312-36706-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a detailed account of the science, politics and social challenges of the entire SENS agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= [[Ben Best]] |title= Book Review: Ending Aging |work= Life Extension Magazine |publisher= [[Life Extension Foundation]] |date=December 2007 |url= http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2007/dec2007_bookreview_01.htm |accessdate= 12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 broadcast on the [[Arte]] German &amp; French TV, de Grey claimed that the first human to live 1,000 years was probably already alive, and might even be between 50 and 60 years old already.&lt;ref&gt;''Aux frontières de l'immortalité'', 16 November 2008, 23:10, director  : Gerald Caillat&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, soon after he began speaking publicly about his gerontological theories, de Grey has been scientific advisor for the Campaign for Aging Research (C.A.R.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/07/longevity-meme-newsletter-july-20-2009.php|title=Longevity Meme Newsletter, July 20 2009|work=Fight Aging!|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2013}}, the SENS Research Foundation has an annual budget of $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sens.org/about/organizational-reports|title=Organizational Reports|work=sens.org|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-aging trance===
[[File:SENS FOUNDATION - AUBREY DE GREY (6838320854).jpg|alt=de Grey smiling|thumb|de Grey, 2012]]
The "pro-aging trance" is a term coined by Grey to describe "the impulsion to leap to embarrassingly unjustified conclusions in order to put the horror of aging out of one's mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= de Grey |first= Aubrey |title= Combating the Tithonus Error: What Works? |journal= [[Rejuvenation Research]] |volume= 11 |issue= 4 |pages= 713–715 |date= August 2008 |doi= 10.1089/rej.2008.0775 |pmid= 18729803}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to de Grey, the pro-aging trance or "pro-aging edifice"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= de Grey |first= Aubrey |title= Cracks in Social Gerontology's Pro-Aging Edifice |journal= [[Rejuvenation Research]] |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–2 |date= February 2009 |doi= 10.1089/rej.2009.0841 |pmid= 19236163}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a psychological strategy which people use to cope with aging, and which is rooted in the belief that aging is not only immutable and unavoidable, but ''desirable'' in some sense, as part of the natural or divine order that should not be perturbed. De Grey refers, in this regard, to the general public's ambivalence towards aging. For example, he states that [[SENS Research Foundation|SENS]] research is often misunderstood or misrepresented as likely to lead to ''prolonging'', rather than postponing, the period of decrepitude characteristic of old age—a belief that de Grey calls the "Tithonus error", in reference to the myth of [[Tithonus]]. He describes this "pro-aging" stance as an irrational response&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2CR7NeLumI}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the perceived inevitability of aging, and compares it with related ideas and experimental findings in [[terror management theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyszczynski|first1=T|last2=Greenberg|first2=J|title=Understanding the paradox of opposition to long-term extension of the human lifespan: fear of feath, cultural worldviews, and the illusion of objectivity|journal=Rejuvenation Research|date=September 2013|volume=16|issue=S1|pages=S36-7|ref=Pyszczynski2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, de Grey believes that defeating aging is feasible and that the pro-aging trance represents a huge barrier to combating aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging|title=Aubrey de Grey: A roadmap to end aging - Talk Video - TED.com|author=Aubrey de Grey|work=ted.com|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding of SENS Research Foundation===
In 2011, de Grey inherited roughly $16.5 million on the death of his mother.&lt;ref name="lef.org"&gt;Ben Best (2013) [http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2013/jul2013_Interview-with-Aubrey-de-Grey-PhD_01.htm "Interview with Aubrey de Grey, PhD"]. Life Extension Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this he assigned $13 million to fund SENS research, which by 2013 had the effect of roughly doubling the SENS Research Foundation's yearly budget to $4 million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Other donors who have given millions to the Foundation include investor [[Peter Thiel]].&lt;ref name="lef.org"/&gt; The foundation also has yearly funding drives that have been successful with some significant donors offering matching grants for members of the public who donate.&lt;ref name=SRFnews201502&gt;{{cite news|last1=SENS Research Foundation|title=February 2015 Newsletter|url=http://www.sens.org/sites/srf.org/files/newsletter-archive/February%202015%20NL.html|accessdate=24 February 2015|work=SENS Research Foundation Newsletter|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FA!20141215&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reason|title=SENS Fundraiser Success!|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2014/12/sens-fundraiser-success.php|publisher=Fight Aging!|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 de Grey was appointed Vice President of New Technology Discovery at [[BioTime#Subsidiaries|AgeX Therapeutics]], a startup in the Longevity space helmed by [[Michael D. West]], PhD.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name = NextBigFuture/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= AgeX Therapeutics lands $10 mln|url=https://www.pehub.com/2017/08/agex-therapeutics-lands-10-mln/ |work= PE HUB |date= August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The seven types of aging damage===
{{Main article|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence}}
De Grey proposed the following types of aging damage:
#Mutations – in chromosomes causing cancer due to nuclear mutations/epimutations:
#:These are changes to the nuclear [[DNA]] (nDNA), the molecule that contains genetic information in [[eukaryote]]s, or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain [[mutation]]s can lead to cancer, and, according to de Grey, non-cancerous mutations and [[Epigenetics|epimutations]] do not contribute to aging within a normal lifespan, so cancer is the only endpoint of these types of damage that must be addressed.
#Mutations – in mitochondria:
#:[[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are components in eukaryotic [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for energy production. They contain their own genetic material, and mutations to their DNA can affect a cell's ability to function properly. Indirectly, these mutations may accelerate many aspects of aging.
#Junk – inside of cells, aka intracellular aggregates:
#:Cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can't be digested simply accumulate as junk inside of cells. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]] and many kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as Alzheimer's) are associated with this problem.
#Junk – outside of cells, aka extracellular aggregates:
#:Harmful junk protein can also accumulate outside of cells. The amyloid [[senile plaque]] seen in the brains of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] patients is one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PTN interviews Dr. Aubrey de Grey, researcher of anti-aging regenerative medicine|
url=http://www.planettechnews.com/interviews/ptn-interviews-dr-aubrey-de-grey-researcher-and-a-thought-leader-in-anti-aging-regenerative-medicine|publisher=[[PlanetTech]] News|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Cells – too few, aka cellular loss:
#:Some of the cells in bodies cannot be replaced, or can be replaced only very slowly – more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number causes the heart to become weaker with age, causes [[Parkinson's disease]], and impairs the [[immune system]].
#Cells – too many, aka [[cellular senescence]]:
#:This is a phenomenon where some cells can no longer [[cell division|divide]], but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other things that they're not supposed to, like secreting proteins that may be harmful. Cell senescence has been proposed as cause or consequence of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]].&lt;ref name="Testa_Ceriello"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pathogenetic Loop Between Diabetes and Cell Senescence|journal=Diabetes Care|year=2007|first=Roberto|last=Testa|author2=Antonio Ceriello|volume=30|issue=11|pages=2974–2975|id= |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/11/2974.full|format=|accessdate=29 December 2012|doi=10.2337/dc07-1534|pmid=17965314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immune senescence is also caused by this.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
#Extracellular protein crosslinks:
#:Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many cross-links form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[presbyopia]].&lt;ref name="050411_aubrey_interview.html"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/6967-hang-25-year-wait-immortality.html Hang in There: The 25-Year Wait for Immortality] interview with LiveScience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deGrey GSP2009"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTMNfU7zftQ&amp;t=20m2s |title=Aubrey de Grey – In Pursuit of Longevity |publisher=[[Singularity University]] |date=22 February 2010 |people=Aubrey de Grey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
De Grey is also a cryonicist, having signed up with [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|Alcor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Aubrey de Grey, PHD, An Exclusive Interview with the Renowned Biogerontologist |url= http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2006/2/profile/Page-01 |accessdate= 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has supported and advocated human cryopreservation, for example by signing an open letter to support research into cryonics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Scientists Open Letter on Cryonics |url= http://www.evidencebasedcryonics.org/scientists-open-letter-on-cryonics/ |accessdate= 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by being an advisor to a UK cryonics and cryopreservation advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= List of Advisors |url= http://www.cryonics-research.org.uk/about-us.html |accessdate= 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
On April 8 2018 de Grey posted a paper to the [[arXiv]] explicitly constructing a unit-distance graph which cannot be colored with fewer than 5 colors. The previous lower bound is due to the [[Hadwiger–Nelson problem|problem's]] original proposal in 1950 by [[Hugo Hadwiger]] and [[Edward Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Criticism==

===''Technology Review'' debate===
In 2005, ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'', in cooperation with the Methuselah Foundation, announced a $20,000 prize for any molecular biologist who could demonstrate that SENS was "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate." The judges of the challenge were [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Anita Goel]], [[Vikram Sheel Kumar]], [[Nathan Myhrvold]], and [[Craig Venter]]. Five submissions were made, of which three met the terms of the challenge. De Grey wrote a rebuttal to each submission, and the challengers wrote responses to each rebuttal. The judges concluded that none of the challengers had disproved SENS, but the magazine opined that one of the rebuttals had been particularly eloquent and well written, and awarded the contestant $10,000. The judges also noted "the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for SENS," and wrote that many of its proposals could not be verified with the current level of scientific knowledge and technology, concluding that "SENS does not compel the assent of many knowledgeable scientists; but neither is it demonstrably wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/|title=Is Defeating Aging Only a Dream?|publisher=Technology Review|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics single out three proposed therapies for criticism: somatic telomerase deletion, somatic mitochondrial genome engineering, and the use of transgenic microbial hydrolase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.technologyreview.com/sens/docs/estepetal.pdf|title=Life Extension Pseudoscience and the SENS Plan|publisher=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EMBO Reports===
A 2005 article about SENS published in the viewpoint section of ''[[EMBO Reports]]'' by 28 scientists concluded that none of de Grey's therapies "has ever been shown to extend the lifespan of any organism, let alone humans".&lt;ref name=EMBOSENS&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=H. |last1=Warner |first2=J. |last2=Anderson |first3=S. |last3=Austad |first4=E. |last4=Bergamini |first5=D. |last5=Bredesen |first6=R. |last6=Butler |first7=B.

&lt;/ref&gt; The SENS Research Foundation, of which de Grey was a cofounder, seems to agree with the EMBO Report as it states, "If you want to reverse the damage of aging right now I'm afraid the simple answer is, you can't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sens.org/sens-research/faq|title=SENS Research Foundation FAQ|publisher=SENS Research Foundation|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, de Grey argues that this reveals a serious gap in understanding between basic scientists and technologists and between biologists studying aging and those studying regenerative medicine.&lt;ref name=EMBOSENSREPLY&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13219">'''Autogamy''', or '''self-fertilization''', refers to the [[Cell fusion|fusion]] of two [[gamete]]s that come from one individual.  Autogamy is predominantly observed in the form of self-pollination, a reproductive mechanism employed by many flowering plants.  However, species of [[protist]]s have also been observed using autogamy as a means of reproduction.  Flowering plants engage in autogamy regularly, while the protists that engage in autogamy only do so in stressful environments.

==Occurrence==

===Protists===
====Paramecium aurelia====
''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'' is the most commonly studied protozoan for autogamy. Similar to other unicellular organisms, ''Paramecium aurelia'' typically reproduce asexually via binary fission or sexually via cross-fertilization.  However, studies have shown that when put under nutritional stress, ''Paramecium aurelia'' will undergo meiosis and subsequent fusion of gametic-like nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, James D. "Autogamy in Paramecium cell cycle stage-specific commitment to meiosis." Experimental cell research 166.2 (1986): 475-485.
&lt;/ref&gt; This process, defined as hemixis, a chromosomal rearrangement process, takes place in a number of steps.  First, the two micronuclei of Paramecium aurelia enlarge and divide two times to form eight nuclei.  Some of these daughter nuclei will continue to divide to create potential future gametic nuclei. Of these potential gametic nuclei, one will divide two more times. Of the four daughter nuclei arising from this step, two of them become anlagen, or cells that will form part of the new organism.  The other two daughter nuclei become the gametic micronuclei that will undergo autogamous self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Diller, W. F. (1936), Nuclear reorganization processes in Paramecium aurelia, with descriptions of autogamy and ‘hemixis’. J. Morphol., 59: 11–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  These nuclear divisions are observed mainly when the Paramecium aurelia is put under nutritional stress.  Research shows that ''Paramecium aurelia'' undergo autogamy synchronously with other individuals of the same species.

====Clonal aging and rejuvenation====

In ''[[Paramecium]] tetraurelia'', vitality declines over the course of successive asexual cell divisions by binary fission. Clonal aging is associated with a dramatic increase in [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]].&lt;ref name="pmid424739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith-Sonneborn J |title=DNA repair and longevity assurance in Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Science |volume=203 |issue=4385 |pages=1115–7 |year=1979 |pmid=424739 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3091993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes GE, Holmes NR |title=Accumulation of DNA damages in aging Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Mol. Gen. Genet. |volume=204 |issue=1 |pages=108–14 |year=1986 |pmid=3091993 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8127914"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilley D, Blackburn EH |title=Lack of telomere shortening during senescence in Paramecium |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1955–8 |year=1994 |pmid=8127914 |pmc=43283 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When paramecia that have experienced clonal aging undergo [[meiosis]], either during conjugation or automixis, the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear [[DNA]] that had just experienced meiosis followed by syngamy.  These paramecia are rejuvenated in the sense of having a restored clonal lifespan.  Thus it appears that clonal aging is due in large part to the progressive accumulation of DNA damage, and that rejuvenation is due to [[DNA repair|repair of DNA damage]] during meiosis that occurs in the micronucleus during conjugation or automixis and reestablishment of the macronucleus by replication of the newly repaired micronuclear DNA.

====Tetrahymena rostrata====
Similar to Paramecium aurelia, the parasitic [[ciliate]] ''Tetrahymena rostrata'' has also been shown to engage in meiosis, autogamy and development of new macronuclei when placed under nutritional stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczanowski, Andrzej. "Cohesion of Clonal Life History, Senescence and Rejuvenation Induced by Autogamy of the Histophagous Ciliate Tetrahymena Rostrata." Protist 167.5 (2016): n. pag. PubMed. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the degeneration and remodeling of genetic information that occurs in autogamy, genetic variability arises and possibly increases an offspring’s chances of survival in stressful environments.

====Allogromia laticollaris====
''[[Allogromia laticollaris]]'' is perhaps the best-studied [[Foraminifera|foraminiferan amoeboid]] for autogamy. ''Allogromia laticollaris'' can alternate between sexual reproduction via cross-fertilization and asexual reproduction via binary fission. The details of the life cycle of Allogromia laticollaris are unknown, but similar to ''Paramecium aurelia'', ''Allogromia laticollaris'' is also shown to sometimes defer to autogamous behavior when placed in nutritional stress. As seen in Paramecium, there is some nuclear dimorphism observed in ''Allogromia laticollaris.''  There are often observations of [[Macronucleus|macronuclei]] and chromosomal fragments coexisting in ''Allogromia laticollaris.''  This is indicative of nuclear and chromosomal degeneration, a process similar to the subdivisions observed in ''Paramecium aurelia.'' Multiple generations of [[Ploidy|haploid]] ''Allogromia laticollaris'' individuals can exist before autogamy actually takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. J. and McEnery, M. E. (1970), Autogamy in Allogromia laticollaris (Foraminifera). The Journal of Protozoology, 17: 184–195.&lt;/ref&gt; The autogamous behavior in Allogromia laticollaris has the added consequence of giving rise to daughter cells that are substantially smaller than those rising from binary fission.&lt;ref&gt;K., Sen Gupta B. Modern Foraminifera. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that this is a survival mechanism employed when the cell is in stressful environments, and thus not able to allocate all resources to creating offspring.  If a cell was under nutritional stress and not able to function regularly, there would be a strong possibility of its offspring’s fitness being sub-par.

===Self-pollination in flowering plants===
Self-pollination is an example of autogamy that occurs in flowering plants.  Self-pollination occurs when the sperm in the pollen from the stamen of a plant goes to the carpels of that same plant and fertilizes the egg cell present. Self-pollination can either be done completely autogamously or geitonogamously.  In the former, the egg and sperm cells that united came from the same flower.  In the latter, the sperm and egg cells can come from a different flower on the same plant.  While the latter method does blur the lines between autogamous self-fertilization and normal sexual reproduction, it is still considered autogamous self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G. "Contributions of Autogamy and Geitonogamy to Self-Fertilization in a Mass-Flowering, Clonal Plant." Ecology 81.2 (2000): 532. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-pollination]] can lead to [[inbreeding depression]] due to expression of deleterious recessive [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19834483"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlesworth D, Willis JH |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=783–96 |year=2009 |pmid=19834483 |doi=10.1038/nrg2664 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meiosis followed by self-pollination results in little genetic variation, raising the question of how meiosis in self-pollinating plants is adaptively maintained over an extended period in preference to a less complicated and less costly asexual ameiotic process for producing progeny. For instance, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is a predominantly self-pollinating plant that has an outcrossing rate in the wild estimated at less than 0.3%,&lt;ref&gt;Abbott RJ, Gomes MF.  Population genetic structure and outcrossing rate of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Heredity 1989 62:411-418&lt;/ref&gt; and self-pollination appears to have evolved roughly a million years ago or more.&lt;ref name="pmid17656687"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang C, Toomajian C, Sherman-Broyles S, Plagnol V, Guo YL, Hu TT, Clark RM, Nasrallah JB, Weigel D, Nordborg M |title=The evolution of selfing in Arabidopsis thaliana |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5841 |pages=1070–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17656687 |doi=10.1126/science.1143153 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptive benefit of meiosis that may explain its long-term maintenance in self-pollinating plants is efficient [[genetic recombination|recombination]]al repair of DNA damage.&lt;ref name="pmid3324702"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE |title=The molecular basis of the evolution of sex |journal=Adv.

==Advantages of autogamy==
	There are several advantages for the self-fertilization observed in flowering plants and protists.  In flowering plants, it is important for some plants not to be dependent on pollinating agents that other plants rely on for fertilization. This is unusual, however, considering that many plant species have evolved to become incompatible with their own gametes.  While these species would not be well served by having autogamous self-fertilization as a reproductive mechanism, other species, which do not have self-incompatibility, would benefit from autogamy.  Protists have the advantage of diversifying their modes of reproduction. This is useful for a multitude of reasons. First, if there is an unfavorable change in the environment that puts the ability to deliver offspring at risk, then it is advantageous for an organism to have autogamy at its disposal. In other organisms, it is seen that genetic diversity arising from sexual reproduction is maintained by changes in the environment that favor certain genotypes over others.
Aside from extreme circumstances, it is possible that this form of reproduction gives rise to a genotype in the offspring that will increase fitness in the environment.  This is due to the nature of the genetic degeneration and remodeling intrinsic to autogamy in unicellular organisms.  Thus, autogamous behavior may become advantageous to have if an individual wanted to ensure offspring viability and survival. This advantage also applies to flowering plants.  However, it is important to note that this change has not shown to produce a progeny with more fitness in unicellular organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G., and Christopher R. Herlihy. "Using a Cost-benefit Approach to Understand the Evolution of Self-fertilization in Plants: The Perplexing Case of Aquilegia Canadensis (Ranunculaceae)." Plant Species Biology 19.3 (2004): 159-73. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the nutrition deprived state of the parent cells before autogamy created a barrier for producing offspring that could thrive in those same stressful environments.

==Disadvantages of autogamy==
	In flowering plants, autogamy has the disadvantage of producing low genetic diversity in the species that use it as the predominant mode of reproduction. This leaves those species particularly susceptible to pathogens and viruses that can harm it. In addition, the foraminiferans that use autogamy have shown to produce substantially smaller progeny as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Christopher G. "Contributions of Autogamy and Geitonogamy to Self-Fertilization in a Mass-Flowering, Clonal Plant." Ecology 81.2 (2000): 532. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates that since it is generally an emergency survival mechanism for unicellular species, the mechanism does not have the nutritional resources that would be provided by the organism if it were undergoing binary fission.

==Evolution of autogamy==
	The evolutionary shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is one of the most frequent evolutionary transitions in plants.  About 10-15% of [[flowering plant]]s are predominantly self-fertilizing.&lt;ref name="pmid23595268"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wright SI, Kalisz S, Slotte T |title=Evolutionary consequences of self-fertilization in plants |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=280 |issue=1760 |pages=20130133 |year=2013 |pmid=23595268 |pmc=3652455 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.0133 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since autogamy in flowering plants and autogamy in unicellular species is fundamentally different, and plants and protists are not related, it is likely that both instances evolved separately.  In flowering plants, it is believed that autogamy evolved one million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Chunlao, Tang. "The Evolution of Selfing in Arabidopsis Thaliana." Science317.5841 (2007): 1070--72. AAAS. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to the little overall genetic variation that arises in progeny, it is not fully understood how autogamy has been maintained in the tree of life.

In [[philosophy]], '''being''' means the existence of a thing. Anything that exists has being. [[Ontology]] is the branch of philosophy that studies being. Being is a concept encompassing [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] features of [[reality]] and [[existence]]. Anything that partakes in being is also called a "being", though often this usage is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression "[[human being]]"). The notion of "being" has, inevitably, been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in Western philosophy with attempts among the [[pre-Socratics]] to deploy it intelligibly. The first effort to recognize and define the concept came from [[Parmenides]], who famously said of it that "what is-is". Common words such as "is", "are", and "am" refer directly or indirectly to being.

As an example of efforts in recent times, [[Martin Heidegger]] (who himself drew on ancient Greek sources) adopted after German terms like ''[[Dasein]]'' to articulate the topic.&lt;ref name="dasein1"&gt;Heidegger, the day  ''[[Being and Time|Sein und Zeit]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;27: "this entity which each of us is himself&amp;nbsp;... we shall denote by the term 'Dasein'."&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern approaches build on such continental European exemplars as Heidegger, and apply metaphysical results to the understanding of human psychology and the human condition generally (notably in the [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] tradition). By contrast, in mainstream [[Analytical philosophy]] the topic is more confined to abstract investigation, in the work of such influential theorists as [[W. V. O. Quine]], to name one of many. One of the most fundamental questions that continues to exercise philosophers is posed by [[William James]]: "How comes the world to be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its place?&amp;nbsp;... from nothing to being there is no logical bridge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Some problems of philosophy: a beginning of an introduction to philosophy|first=William|last=James|authorlink=William James|pages=38, 40|year=1916|location=New York|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The substantial being==

===Being and the substance theorists===
The deficit of such a bridge was first encountered in history by the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic philosophers]] during the process of evolving a classification of all beings (noun). Aristotle, who wrote after the Pre-Socratics, applies the term [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] (perhaps not originally) to ten highest-level classes. They comprise one category of substance ([[ousia]]e) existing independently (man, tree) and nine categories of accidents, which can only exist in something else (time, place). In Aristotle, substances are to be clarified by stating their [[definition]]: a note expressing a larger class (the genus) followed by further notes expressing [[Differentia|specific difference]]s (differentiae) within the class. The substance so defined was a species. For example, the species, man, may be defined as an animal (genus) that is rational (difference). As the difference is potential within the genus; that is, an animal may or may not be rational, the difference is not identical to, and may be distinct from, the genus.

Applied to being, the system fails to arrive at a definition for the simple reason that no difference can be found. The species, the genus, and the difference are all equally being: a being is a being that is being. The genus cannot be nothing because nothing is not a class of everything. The trivial solution that being is being added to nothing is only a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]: being is being. There is no simpler intermediary between being and non-being that explains and classifies being.

[[File:Being Parmenides.png|thumb|right|The Being according to [[Parmenides]] is like the mass of a sphere.]]
Pre-Socratic reaction to this deficit was varied. As [[Substance theory|substance theorists]] they accepted [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the hypothesis that appearances are deceiving, that reality is to be reached through reasoning. [[Parmenides]] reasoned that if everything is identical to being and being is a category of the same thing then there can be neither differences between things nor any change. To be different, or to change, would amount to [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] or being non-being; that is, not existing. Therefore, being is a homogeneous and non-differentiated sphere and the appearance of beings is illusory. [[Heraclitus]], on the other hand, foreshadowed modern thought by denying existence. Reality does not exist, it flows, and beings are an illusion upon the flow.

[[Aristotle]] knew of this tradition when he began his ''Metaphysics'', and had already drawn his own conclusion, which he presented under the guise of asking what being is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle|authorlink=Aristotle|title=[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]|chapter=Book VII Section 1 (paragraph 1028b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"And indeed the question which was raised of old is raised now and always, and is always the subject of doubt, viz., what being is, is just the question, what is substance? For it is this that some assert to be one, others more than one, and that some assert to be limited in number, others unlimited. And so we also must consider chiefly and primarily and almost exclusively what that is which is in this sense."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and reiterates in no uncertain terms:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Chapter VII, Section 4 (paragraph 1030a).&lt;/ref&gt; "Nothing, then, which is not a species of a genus will have an essence – only species will have it ....". Being, however, for Aristotle, is not a genus.

===Aristotle's theory of act and potency===
One might expect a solution to follow from such certain language but none does. Instead Aristotle launches into a rephrasing of the problem, the [[Potentiality and actuality|Theory of Act and Potency]]. In the definition of man as a two-legged animal Aristotle presumes that "two-legged" and "animal" are parts of other beings, but as far as man is concerned, are only potentially man. At the point where they are united into a single being, man, the being, becomes actual, or real. Unity is the basis of actuality:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'', Book IX, Chapter 10 (paragraph 1051b).&lt;/ref&gt; "... 'being' is being combined and one, and 'not being' is being not combined but more than one." Actuality has taken the place of existence, but Aristotle is no longer seeking to know what the actual is; he accepts it without question as something generated from the potential. He has found a "half-being" or a "pre-being", the potency, which is fully being as part of some other substance. Substances, in Aristotle, unite what they actually are now with everything they might become.

==The transcendental being==
Some of Thomas Aquinas' propositions were reputedly condemned by Étienne Tempier, the local Bishop of Paris (not the Papal Magisterium itself) in 1270 and 1277,&lt;ref&gt;For text of condemnations 1277 (technically still 1276 at the date, since before 25 of March) see David Piché, La condemnation parisienne de 1277, [http://www.vrin.fr/html/main.htm?action=loadbook&amp;isbn=2711614166], parallel Latin text with his French translation, or online list Latin only with footnotes, by Hans-Georg Lundahl, [http://petitlien.com/tempier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William A. “Thomism and Its Opponents.” ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages''. Ed. Joseph R. Strayer. Vol. 12. New York: Scribner, 1982. 38–45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but his dedication to the use of philosophy to elucidate theology was so thorough that he was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1568. Those who adopt it are called [[Thomism|Thomists]].

===Thomistic analogical predication of being===
In a single sentence, parallel to Aristotle's statement asserting that being is substance, St. Thomas pushes away from the Aristotelian doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The metaphysical thought of Thomas Aquinas: from finite being to uncreated being|first=John F. |last=Wippel|page=75|series=Monographs of the Society for Mediaeval and Renaissance Philosophy, No. 1|year=2000|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Being is not a genus, since it is not predicated univocally but only analogically." His term for analogy is Latin ''analogia''. In the categorical classification of all beings, all substances are partly the same: man and chimpanzee are both animals and the animal part in man is "the same" as the animal part in chimpanzee. Most fundamentally all substances are matter, a theme taken up by science, which postulated one or more matters, such as earth, air, fire or water ([[Empedocles]]). In today's chemistry the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in a chimpanzee are identical to the same elements in a man.

The original text reads, ''"Although equivocal predications must be reduced to univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal cause of the whole species, as for instance the sun is the cause of the generation of all men; whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient cause of the whole species (otherwise it would be the cause of itself, since it is contained in the species), but is a particular cause of this individual which it places under the species by way of participation. Therefore the universal cause of the whole species is not an univocal agent; and the universal cause comes before the particular cause. But this universal agent, whilst it is not univocal, nevertheless is not altogether equivocal, otherwise it could not produce its own likeness, but rather it is to be called an analogical agent, as all univocal predications are reduced to one first non-univocal analogical predication, which is being."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1013.htm#article5|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The names of God (Prima Pars, Q. 13)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If substance is the highest category and there is no substance, being, then the unity perceived in all beings by virtue of their existing must be viewed in another way. St. Thomas chose the analogy: all beings are like, or analogous to, each other in existing. This comparison is the basis of his Analogy of Being. The analogy is said of being in many different ways, but the key to it is the real distinction between existence and essence. Existence is the principle that gives reality to an essence not the same in any way as the existence: "If things having essences are real, and it is not of their essence to be, then the reality of these things must be found in some principle other than (really distinct from) their essence."&lt;ref name=Kreyche70&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyche|1959|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substance can be real or not. What makes an individual substance – a man, a tree, a planet – real is a distinct act, a "to be", which actuates its unity. An analogy of proportion is therefore possible:&lt;ref name=Kreyche70/&gt; "essence is related to existence as potency is related to act."

Existences are not things; they do not themselves exist, they lend themselves to essences, which do not intrinsically have them. They have no nature; an existence receives its nature from the essence it actuates. Existence is not being; it gives being – here a customary phrase is used, existence is a principle (a source) of being, not a previous source, but one which is continually in effect. The stage is set for the concept of God as the cause of all existence, who, as the Almighty, holds everything actual without reason or explanation as an act purely of will.

===The transcendentals===
Aristotle's classificatory scheme had included the five [[predicables]], or characteristics that might be predicated of a substance. One of these was the [[Property (philosophy)|property]], an essential universal true of the species, but not in the definition (in modern terms, some examples would be grammatical language, a property of man, or a spectral pattern characteristic of an element, both of which are defined in other ways). Pointing out that predicables are predicated [[Univocity|univocally]] of substances; that is, they refer to "the same thing" found in each instance, St. Thomas argued that whatever can be said about being is not univocal, because all beings are unique, each actuated by a unique existence. It is the analogous possession of an existence that allows them to be identified as being; therefore, being is an analogous predication.

Whatever can be predicated of all things is universal-like but not universal, category-like but not a category. St. Thomas called them (perhaps not originally) the ''transcendentia'', "[[transcendentals]]", because they "climb above" the categories, just as being climbs above substance. Later academics also referred to them as "the properties of being."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A companion to metaphysics|editor-first=Jaegwon |editor-last=Kim|editor2-first=Ernest |editor2-last=Sosa|pages=21–22|series=Blackwell Companions to philosophy|year=1995|contribution=Aquinas, St. Thomas|first=Jan A.|last=Aersten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number is generally three or four.

==Being in Islamic philosophy==
The nature of "being" has also been debated and explored in [[Islamic philosophy]], notably by [[Ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]), [[Suhrawardi Maqtul|Suhrawardi]], and [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/personalities/msadra/mulla_sadra.php|title=Iranian Personalities: Sadr Al-Din Mohammad Shirazi|author=|date=|website=www.iranchamber.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; [[Indo-European copula|A modern linguistic approach]] which notices that [[Persian language]] has exceptionally developed two kinds of "[[Indo-European copula|is]]"es, i.e. ''ast'' ("is", as a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) and ''hast'' (as an existential "is") examines the linguistic properties of the two lexemes in the first place, then evaluates how the statements made by other languages with regard to ''being'' can stand the test of Persian frame of reference.

In this modern linguistic approach, it is noticed that the original language of the source, e.g. [[Greek language|Greek]] (like [[German language|German]] or [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]), has only one word for two concepts, ''ast'' and ''hast'', or, like [[Arabic language|Arabic]], has no word at all for either word. It therefore exploits the Persian ''hast'' (existential ''is'') versus ''ast'' (predicative ''is'' or [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) to address both Western and Islamic ontological arguments on ''being'' and ''existence''.&lt;ref&gt;Toofan, M. ''Zabān ast yā hast?''(Language: is or exists?. Ketāb-e Tehran, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

This linguistic method shows the scope of confusion created by languages which cannot differentiate between existential be and copula. It manifests, for instance, that the main theme of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'' is  ''astī'' (is-ness) rather than ''hastī'' (existence). When, in the beginning of his book, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] claims that people always talk about existence in their everyday language, without knowing what it means, the example he resorts to is: "the sky ''is'' blue" which in Persian can be ONLY translated with the use of the copula ''ast'', and says nothing about ''being'' or ''existence''.

In the same manner, the linguistic method addresses the ontological works written in Arabic. Since [[Arabic language|Arabic]], like [[Latin]] in Europe, had become the official language of philosophical and scientific works in the so-called Islamic World, the early Persian or Arab philosophers had difficulty discussing ''being'' or ''existence'', since the [[Arabic language]], like other Semitic languages, had no verb for either predicative "be" ([[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) or existential "be". So if you try to translate the aforementioned [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s example into Arabic it appears as السماء زرقاء (viz. "The Sky-- blue") with no linking "is" to be a sign of existential statement. To overcome the problem, when translating the [[ancient Greek philosophy]], certain words were coined like ایس ''aysa'' (from Arabic لیس ''laysa'' 'not') for '[[Indo-European copula|is]]'. Eventually the Arabic verb وجد ''wajada'' (to find) prevailed, since it was thought that whatever is existent, is to be "''found''" in the world. Hence ''existence'' or Being was called وجود ''wujud'' (Cf. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''finns'' [found]&gt; there exist; also the [[Medieval Latin]] coinage of ''exsistere'' 'standing out (there in the world)' &gt; appear&gt; exist).&lt;br /&gt;  Now, with regard to the fact that Persian, as the mother tongue of both [[Avicenna]] and [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], was in conflict with either Greek or Arabic in this regard, these philosophers should have been warned implicitly by their mother tongue not to confuse two kinds of linguistic beings (viz. [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] vs. existential). In fact when analyzed thoroughly, [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], or Persian ''ast'' ('is') indicates an ever-moving chain of relations with no fixed ''entity'' to hold onto (every ''entity'', say A, will be dissolved into "A is B" and so on, as soon as one tries to define it). Therefore, the whole reality or what we see as existence ("found" in our world) resembles an ever-changing world of ''astī'' (is-ness) flowing in time and space. On the other hand, while Persian ''ast''  can be considered as the 3rd person singular of the verb 'to be', there is no verb but an arbitrary one supporting ''hast'' ('is' as an existential be= exists) has neither future nor past tense and nor a negative form of its own: ''hast'' is just a single untouchable lexeme. It needs no other linguistic element to be complete (''Hast.'' is a complete sentence meaning "s/he it exists"). In fact, any manipulation of the arbitrary verb, e.g. its conjugation, turns ''hast'' back into a copula.

Eventually from such linguistic analyses, it appears that while ''astī'' (is-ness) would resemble the world of [[Heraclitus]], ''hastī'' (existence) would rather approaches a metaphysical concept resembling the [[Parmenides|Parmenidas]]'s interpretation of ''existence''.

In this regard, [[Avicenna]], who was a firm follower of [[Aristotle]], could not accept either Heraclitian ''is-ness'' (where only constant was ''change''), nor Parmenidean ''monist immoveable existence'' (the ''hastī'' itself being constant). To solve the contradiction, it so appeared to Philosophers of Islamic world that [[Aristotle]] considered the core of existence (i.e. its ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'') as a fixed constant, while its facade ([[Accident (philosophy)|accident]]) was prone to change. To translate such a philosophical image into Persian it is like having ''hastī'' (existence) as a unique constant core covered by ''astī'' (is-ness) as a cloud of ever-changing relationships. It is clear that the Persian language, deconstructs such a composite as a sheer mirage, since it is not clear how to link the interior core (existence) with the exterior shell (is-ness). Furthermore, ''hast'' cannot be linked to anything but itself (as it is self-referent).

The argument has a theological echos as well: assuming that God is the ''Existence'', beyond time and space, a question is raised by philosophers of the Islamic world as how he, as a transcendental existence, may ever create or contact a world of ''is-ness'' in space-time.

However, [[Avicenna]] who was more philosopher than theologian, followed the same line of argumentation as that of his ancient master, [[Aristotle]], and tried to reconcile between ''ast'' and ''hast'', by considering the latter as higher order of existence than the former. It is like a hierarchical order of existence. It was a philosophical [[Tower of Babel]] that the restriction of his own mother tongue (Persian) would not allow to be built, but he could maneuver in Arabic by giving the two concepts the same name ''wujud'', although with different attributes. So, implicitly, ''astī'' (is-ness) appears as ممکن الوجود "momken-al-wujud" (contingent being), and ''hastī'' (existence) as واجب الوجود "wājeb-al-wujud" (necessary being).

On the other hand, centuries later, [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], chose a more radical route, by inclining towards the reality of ''astī'' (is-ness),  as the true mode of existence, and tried to get rid of the concept of ''hastī'' (existence as fixed or immovable). Thus, in his philosophy, the universal movement penetrates deep into the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'',  in unison with changing [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]].  He called this deep existential change حرکت جوهری ''harekat-e jowhari'' (Substantial Movement). In such a changing existence, the whole world has to go through instantaneous annihilation and recreation incessantly, while as [[Avicenna]] had predicted in his remarks on Nature, such a universal change or substantial movement would eventually entail the shortening and lengthening of time as well which has never been observed. This logical objection, which was made on Aristotle's argumentation, could not be answered in the ancient times or medieval age, but now it does not sound contradictory to the real nature of Time (as addressed in relativity theory), so by a reverse argument, a philosopher may indeed deduce that everything is changing (moving) even in the deepest core of Being.

==Being in the Age of Reason==
Although innovated in the late [[medieval]] period, Thomism was dogmatized in the [[Renaissance]]. From roughly 1277 to 1567, it dominated the philosophic landscape. The [[rationalist]] philosophers, however, with a new emphasis on [[Reason]] as a tool of the intellect, brought the classical and medieval traditions under new scrutiny, exercising a new concept of [[doubt]], with varying outcomes. Foremost among the new doubters were the [[Empiricism|empiricists]], the advocates of [[scientific method]], with its emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and reliance on evidence gathered from sensory experience. In parallel with the [[revolution]]s against rising political [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] based on [[established religion]] and the replacement of [[faith]] by reasonable faith, new systems of metaphysics were promulgated in the lecture halls by charismatic professors, such as [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Hegel]]. The late 19th and 20th centuries featured an emotional return to the concept of existence under the name of [[existentialism]]. These philosophers were concerned mainly with ethics and religion. The metaphysical side became the domain of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenalists]]. In parallel with these philosophies Thomism continued under the protection of the Catholic Church; in particular, the [[Jesuit order]].

===Empiricist doubts===
[[Rationalism]] and [[empiricism]] have had many definitions, most concerned with specific schools of philosophy or groups of philosophers in particular countries, such as Germany. In general rationalism is the predominant school of thought in the multi-national, cross-cultural [[Age of reason]], which began in the century straddling 1600 as a conventional date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=age of reason|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/age+of+reason|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; empiricism is the reliance on sensory data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=empiricism|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism|accessdate=9 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090125191857/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism| archivedate= 25 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; gathered in experimentation by scientists of any country, who, in the Age of Reason were rationalists. An early professed empiricist, [[Thomas Hobbes]], known as an eccentric denizen of the court of [[Charles II of England]] (an "old bear"), published in 1651 ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', a political treatise written during the [[English civil war]], containing an early [[manifesto]] in English of rationalism.
Hobbes said:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=18, 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Latines called Accounts of mony Rationes ... and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in all other things....When a man reasoneth hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall ... For Reason ... is nothing but Reckoning ... of the consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Hobbes reasoning is the right process of drawing conclusions from definitions (the "names agreed upon"). He goes on to define error as self-contradiction of definition ("an absurdity, or senselesse Speech"&lt;ref name=hobbes23&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or conclusions that do not follow the definitions on which they are supposed to be based. Science, on the other hand, is the outcome of "right reasoning," which is based on "natural sense and imagination", a kind of sensitivity to nature, as "nature it selfe cannot erre."

Having chosen his ground carefully Hobbes launches an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] attack on [[metaphysics]]. The academic philosophers had arrived at the [[Hylomorphism (Aristotelian)|Theory of Matter and Form]] from consideration of certain natural [[paradox]]es subsumed under the general heading of the Unity Problem. For example, a body appears to be one thing and yet it is distributed into many parts. Which is it, one or many? Aristotle had arrived at the real distinction between [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]], metaphysical components whose interpenetration produces the paradox. The whole unity comes from the substantial form and the distribution into parts from the matter. Inhering in the parts giving them really distinct unities are the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental forms]]. The unity of the whole being is actuated by another really distinct principle, the existence.

If nature cannot err, then there are no paradoxes in it; to Hobbes, the paradox is a form of the absurd, which is inconsistency:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity" and "For error is but a deception ... But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd ...." Among Hobbes examples are "round quadrangle", "immaterial substance", "free subject."&lt;ref name=hobbes23/&gt; Of the scholastics he says:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=501}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Yet they will have us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at one and the same time in many places [the problem of the universals]; and many bodies at one and the same time in one place [the whole and the parts]; ... And these are but a small part of the Incongruencies they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, instead of admiring, and adoring of the Divine and Incomprehensible Nature ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The real distinction between essence and existence, and that between form and matter, which served for so long as the basis of metaphysics, Hobbes identifies as "the Error of Separated Essences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The words "Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like" add no meaning to an argument nor do derived words such as "Entity, Essence, Essentially, Essentiality", which "are the names of nothing"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=498–499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but are mere "Signes" connecting "one name or attribute to another: as when we say, ''"a man is a living body"'', we mean not that the ''man'' is one thing, the ''living body'' another, and the ''is'', or ''being'' a third: but that the ''man'', and the ''living body'', is the same thing; ..."  Metaphysiques, Hobbes says, is "far from the possibility of being understood" and is "repugnant to natural reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=496–497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being to Hobbes (and the other empiricists) is the physical universe:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The world, (I mean ... the Universe, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimension of magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body ... and consequently every part of the Universe is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: and because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing; and consequently no where."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobbes' view is representative of his tradition. As Aristotle offered the categories and the act of existence, and Aquinas the analogy of being, the rationalists also had their own system, the [[great chain of being]], an interlocking hierarchy of beings from God to dust.

===Idealist systems===
In addition to the [[materialism]] of the empiricists, under the same [[aegis]] of Reason, rationalism produced systems that were diametrically opposed now called [[idealism]], which denied the reality of [[matter]] in favor of the reality of [[mind]]. By a 20th-century classification, the idealists ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]] and others), are considered the beginning of [[continental philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritzman|first=J. M.|date=2011-10-12|title=Review of Kant, Kantianism, and Idealism: The Origins of Continental Philosophy|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/kant-kantianism-and-idealism-the-origins-of-continental-philosophy/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the empiricists are the beginning, or the immediate predecessors, of [[analytical philosophy]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/analytic-philosophy|title=Analytic philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Being in continental philosophy and existentialism==
Some philosophers deny that the concept of "being" has any meaning at all, since we only define an object's existence by its relation to other objects, and actions it undertakes. The term "I am" has no meaning by itself; it must have an action or relation appended to it. This in turn has led to the thought that "being" and [[nothing]]ness are closely related, developed in [[Existentialism|existential]] philosophy.

[[Existentialism|Existentialist]] philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], as well as [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] have also written extensively on the concept of being. Hegel distinguishes between the being of objects ([[being in itself]]) and the being of people (''[[Geist (philosophy)|Geist]])''.  Hegel, however, did not think there was much hope for delineating a "meaning" of being, because being stripped of all predicates is simply nothing.

Heidegger, in his quest to re-pose the original pre-Socratic question of Being, wondered at how to meaningfully ask the question of the meaning of being, since it is both the greatest, as it includes everything that is, and the least, since no particular thing can be said of it.  He distinguishes between different modes of beings: a privative mode is [[present-at-hand]], whereas beings in a fuller sense are described as [[ready-to-hand]].  The one who asks the question of Being is described as Da-sein ("there/here-being") or '''[[being-in-the-world]].''' Sartre, popularly understood as misreading Heidegger (an understanding supported by Heidegger's essay "Letter on Humanism" which responds to Sartre's famous address, "Existentialism is a Humanism"), employs modes of being in an attempt to ground his concept of freedom ontologically by distinguishing between being-in-itself and being-for-itself.

Being is also understood as one's "state of being," and hence its common meaning is in the context of human (personal) [[experience]], with aspects that involve expressions and manifestations coming from an innate "being", or personal character. [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] coined the term "''[[dasein]]''" for this property of being in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]'' ("this entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term 'dasein.'"&lt;ref name="dasein1"/&gt;), in which he argued that being or ''dasein'' links one's sense of one's body to one's perception of [[world]]. Heidegger, amongst others, referred to an innate language as the foundation of being, which gives [[Information|signal]] to all aspects of being.

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|i}} is a geometric property of some molecules and ions.  A chiral molecule/ion is non-superposable on its [[mirror image]]. The presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon center]] is one of several structural features that induce [[chirality]] in organic and inorganic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice. Pearson Educational Books. {{ISBN|9780131407480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers (2004)
{{ISBN|0763721972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Superposability|file=S06144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word for hand, χεῖρ (''kheir'').

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called [[enantiomer]]s or '''optical [[isomer]]s'''. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|right-handed or left-handed]]. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the [[stereochemistry]] in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]].  The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.

Chiral molecules and ions are described by various ways of designating their [[absolute configuration]], which codify either the entity's geometry or its [[polarimetry|ability to rotate plane-polarized light]], a common technique in studying chirality.

== Definition ==
Chirality is based on [[Molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry elements]]. Specifically, a chiral compound can contain no [[improper axis of rotation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity).  Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A., "Chemical Applications of Group Theory," John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereogenic centers==
{{main article|Stereogenic center}}
In general, chiral molecules have '''point chirality''' at a single ''stereogenic'' atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different '''absolute configurations''' at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The stereogenic atom (also known as the ''stereocenter'') is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules.  However a stereocenter can coincide with any atom, including metals (as in many chiral [[coordination compound]]s), phosphorus, or sulfur. The low barrier of [[nitrogen inversion]] make most ''N''-chiral amines (NRR′R″) impossible to resolve, but [[P-Chiral phosphine|''P''-chiral phosphines]] (PRR′R″) as well as S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′) are optically stable.
[[File:R-BINOL-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|144px|right|[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol]] is an example of a molecule lacking point chirality.]]
While the presence of a stereogenic atom describes the great majority of chiral molecules, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a stereogenic atom.  Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro[[adamantane]], methylethylphenyl[[tetrahedrane]], certain [[calixarenes]] and [[fullerenes]], which have [[inherent chirality]].  The [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric species]] [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-bi-2-naphthol]] (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro[[Propadiene|allene]] have [[axial chirality]]. (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]] and many [[ferrocene]]s have [[planar chirality]].

When the optical [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotation]] for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit [[cryptochirality]].

Even isotopic differences must be considered when examining chirality. Illustrative is the derivative of [[benzyl alcohol]] PhCHDOH, which is chiral. The ''S'' enantiomer has [''α'']&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = +0.715°.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Streitwieser}}{{cite journal |author1=Streitwieser, A., Jr. |author2=Wolfe, J. R., Jr. |author3=Schaeffer, W.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. In biological systems, most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|L}}) and sugars are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|D}}). Typical naturally occurring proteins are made of {{smallcaps all|L}}-amino acids and are known as ''left-handed proteins''; the comparably rarer {{smallcaps all|D}}-amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''.

The origin of this [[homochirality]] in [[biology]] is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08&gt;{{cite book | author= Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  | year= 2008 | title= Amino acids and the Asymmetry of Life | edition = | location = Berlin, GER | publisher = Springer | isbn= 3540768858 | chapter =  | pages = | url = | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientists believe that Earth life's "choice" of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality. However, there is some suggestion that early amino acids could have formed in comet dust. In this case, circularly polarised radiation (which makes up 17% of stellar radiation) could have caused the selective destruction of one chirality of amino acids, leading to a selection bias which ultimately resulted in all life on Earth being homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKee |first=Maggie |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7895-space-radiation-may-select-amino-acids-for-life.html |title=Space radiation may select amino acids for life |publisher=New Scientist |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meierhenrich Uwe J., Nahon Laurent, Alcaraz Christian, Hendrik Bredehöft Jan, Hoffmann Søren V., Barbier Bernard, Brack André | year = 2005 | title = Asymmetric Vacuum UV photolysis of the Amino Acid Leucine in the Solid State | url = | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 5630–5634 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200501311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

{{smallcaps all|L}}-forms of amino acids tend to be tasteless, whereas {{smallcaps all|D}}-forms tend to taste sweet.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08/&gt; [[Spearmint]] leaves contain the {{smallcaps all|L}}-enantiomer of the chemical [[carvone]] or ''R''-(−)-carvone and [[caraway]] seeds contain the {{smallcaps all|D}}-enantiomer or ''S''-(+)-carvone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf60176a035 | title=Chemical and sensory data supporting the difference between the odors of the enantiomeric carvones |author1=Theodore J.

Food Chem.]] | volume=19 | issue=4 | year=1971 | pages=785–787}}&lt;/ref&gt; These smell different to most people because our olfactory [[sensory receptor|receptor]]s are chiral.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Srinivasarao&gt;{{cite journal | author= Srinivasarao, M. | year = 1999 | title= Chirality and Polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–376 | doi = | url=  | quote =  }} {{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In inorganic chemistry ==

{{main article|Complex (chemistry)#Optical isomerism|l1=Complex (chemistry): Isomerism}}
Chirality is a symmetry property, not a characteristic of any part of the periodic table.  Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral.  [[Quartz]] is an example from the mineral kingdom.  Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in [[nonlinear optics]].

In the areas of [[coordination chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], chirality is pervasive and of practical importance.  A famous example is [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;von Zelewsky, A. (1995). ''Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds.'' Chichester: John Wiley.. {{ISBN|047195599X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be designated as Λ (capital [[lambda]], the Greek version of "L") for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital [[delta (letter)|delta]], Greek "D") for a right-handed twist (pictured).

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-[[amino acid]] complexes.  If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of [[asymmetric catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|189138953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and practices==

The term ''[[optical activity]]'' is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or [[levorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] the plane of a beam of [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized light]] [[counterclockwise]]. The (+)-form, or [[dextrorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]] and is expressed as the optical rotation.

==Miscellaneous nomenclature==
* Any non-[[racemic]] chiral substance is called '''scalemic'''.  Scalemic materials can be enantiopure or enantioenriched.&lt;ref name=EllielChir97&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eliel, E.L. | year = 1997 | title = Infelicitous Stereochemical Nomenclatures | journal = Chirality | volume = 9 | pages = 428–430 | url =  https://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/inter.4/eliel/eliel.html | access-date = 5 February 2016 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-636x(1997)9:5/6&lt;428::aid-chir5&gt;3.3.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A chiral substance is '''enantiopure''' when only one of two possible enantiomers is present so that all molecules within a sample  have the same chirality sense. Use of '''homochiral''' as a synonym is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=asymmetric synthesis| file = E02072}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A chiral substance is '''enantioenriched''' or '''heterochiral''' when its enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50 but less than 100:0.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomerically enriched (enantioenriched)| file = E02071}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enantiomeric excess]] or '''e.e.''' is the difference between how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, a sample with 40% e.e. of ''R'' contains 70% ''R'' and 30% ''S'' (70% − 30% = 40%).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomer excess (enantiomeric excess)| file = E02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Lakhtakia, A. (ed.) | title=Selected Papers on Natural Optical Activity (SPIE Milestone Volume 15) |publisher=SPIE | year=1990 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. [[Louis Pasteur]] deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pasteur, L. | title=Researches on the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products, English translation of French original, published by Alembic Club Reprints (Vol. 14, pp. 1–46) in 1905, facsimile reproduction by SPIE in a 1990 book | year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Eliel, Ernest Ludwig; Wilen, Samuel H. &amp; Mander, Lewis N. | year = 1994 | title = Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds | edition = 1st | chapter = Chirality in Molecules Devoid of Chiral Centers (Chapter 14) | pages = | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IyfwAAAAMAAJ | access-date = 2 February 2016 | isbn =  0471016705 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chirality'' itself was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Bentley, Ronald | year = 1995 | title = From Optical Activity in Quartz to Chiral Drugs: Molecular Handedness in Biology and Medicine. | journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|Perspect.

The '''Coda''' is a group of [[fictional]] female [[warrior]]s in [[Wildstorm]] [[comic book|comics]]. The Coda first appeared in ''[[WildC.A.T.S.]]'' volume 1 #1 (August, 1992) and were created by [[Brandon Choi]] and [[Jim Lee]]. 

==Fictional background==
The Coda are a particular race of all female aliens who live on the planet Khera. They are trained in their own unique form of martial arts. Their weapon of choice is the Clef Blade, a weapon resembling a harpoon or a lance, though they often wield swords or even modern firearms. Coda warriors usually wear red markings on their face.  A sign (usually a circle) on the forehead and stripes on the cheeks) depicting their ranking within the sisterhood. A second class group of Coda warriors of different species have formed on various planets, carrying the blood of original Coda warriors only.

===Khera===
The Coda was founded on the planet Khera, home to the [[Kherubim]]. The Kherubim were a race blessed with longevity, but the downside was that they had become nearly infertile. Childbirth was a great honor and therefore every Kheran had to participate in a ritual in which a Kheran female and a Kheran male had to couple once. Should the female become pregnant and give birth, she would go on to become a priestess. Otherwise she could do with her life as she pleased. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] had been selected to mate with [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] and their union did result in childbirth, the child [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]. Zannah, though, loved being a warrior; so her mother, Harmony, proposed a plan: She would tell her people that Zannah's child had died, and would raise Kenesha as her own daughter. Zannah accepted, and Harmony became a figure of legend, the only Kherubim to have given birth to more than one child in ages. This legend was the foundation of the Sisterhood known as the Coda, a completely female [[caste]] of warriors, devoted to the honor of combat. Their male counterpart is known as the Brotherhood of the Sword. Over the millennia, the Coda would grow in power, and at present they are the second largest political faction within Kherubim society. Only the Pantheon is slightly larger. The Coda's headquarters is Zealot's former home, the Tower of Red Lament. Among the Coda on Khera, there is a small cell of elite assassins called the Skein. They have no known counterpart among the Earthborn Coda. The first rule of The Coda is: ''The weapon is the extension of the flesh, the flesh of the mind, the mind of the soul''.

===Earth===
The Kherubim were at war with the [[Daemonite]]s, another spacefaring race. During a ship-to-ship combat, a Kheran and a Daemonite vessel crashlanded on Earth. Both Zannah and Kenesha were on board this vessel. The Kherubim were physically identical to humans and quickly integrated within human society, inspiring tales of superhuman heroes, gods and angels. The Daemonites had the ability to possess human hosts and inspired tales of possession, demons and monsters. Their war continued underground. 

To aid them in their war, Zannah, now called Zealot and two of her fellow Coda generals, Andromache and Artemis, started training human Coda Warriors, giving birth to the myth of the Amazons. They established a hidden Coda city on Mt. Themyscira in [[Greece]]. Kenesha took the name [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]], but had no desire to join the Coda. As the Earthborn sisterhood are not born immortals, the immortal members take part in a ''Blood Dance'' with the newer members worthy of being called Coda Warriors. In the ritual they cut each other in a ritualistic dance and rub each other's wounds, thus mingling the blood, transferring the immortal blood into the non-immortal. The blood of a Kherubim, mingled with a human's during a special ritual, gave the gift of longevity to normal humans and this became an important ritual for Earth's Coda. The Kheran Coda sisterhood have been shown to perform this ritual also, but as they are all immortal, their reasons have more to do with the symbolic than with the need for survival. The Coda's Cleft Blades, both on Khera and on Earth, are considered very sacred to the sisterhood. They are only to be used in a death duel or in their ritual Blood Dance. During a battle near Troy (presumably the [[Trojan War]]), Zealot's actions branded her as a traitor to the rest of the Coda, to be killed on sight. The Coda general Andromache took over the role of [[Majestrix]]. Under her rule the Coda began selling their skills to the highest bidders and became less noble warriors and more power hungry conquerors. They also began establishing smaller Coda bases around the world. Though Mt. Themyscira still proved to be the oldest and most sacred of homes to the Amazons, the Coda have also been shown to reside in a massive island off the coast of Africa which they refer to as the Coda Citadel, as discovered by members of [[Gen¹³]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gen¹³'' (vol. 2), #3-5&lt;/ref&gt;  As Zealot was seen as a traitor to the sisterhood, she became a constant target of The Coda for several centuries.

[[Image:CodaWarrior.JPG|thumb|[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]] displays standard Coda weapons, such as the Cleft Blade]]
In the mid 20th century, Zealot trained [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] in the fighting style of the Coda, making him the first male Coda. When the Coda discovered this they marked Grifter a target for extermination as they believed the Coda ways are only to be carried by women. By now many Coda were working for the Cabal, an organisation founded by the Daemonites. Zealot, Grifter and Savant all were part of the [[WildC.A.T.s]] and Zealot also eventually trained WildC.A.T.s member [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] in the Coda martial arts. The WildC.A.T.s and Coda fought often. The WildC.A.T.s returned once to Khera where Zealot was nearly assassinated by her own Coda Sisters, just to make her a martyr for their cause. Zealot was disgusted with the Sisters betrayal of their ideals and returned to Earth with the other WildC.A.T.s.

Several months later on Earth, Zealot apparently died on a mission causing the WildC.A.T.s to disband. She decided that the actions of the Coda on Earth and on Khera proved that the Coda had become corrupt and decided that the corruption had to be destroyed. She set out to single-handedly erase the Coda from the face of the Earth. She killed all Coda in America she could find, but spared Grifter, because of their shared romantic past. She warned him not to follow her.

Zealot continued her quest in Europe and destroyed most of the Coda there, but was captured by their top agent, The Grand Sarin. Grifter gathered several allies to save her, resulting in a war between his forces and the Coda. In the end, his small group turned out not to be enough, but Grifter called in the help of former WildC.A.T.s member and his current employer, [[Spartan (comics)|Jack Marlowe]], who used his powers to teleport part of the Mediterranean Sea on top of the Coda, drowning many of them. Majestrix Andromache survived and with her surviving troops she faced Grifter and his friends. At the same time FBI-agent Chandler, whose partner had been killed by the Coda, had found the Coda's armory. Chandler detonated the armory, blowing up the entire Coda base. Grifter and his friends were teleported away by Marlowe in time, but Andromache and her soldiers were caught in the blast.

Currently there are only few Earth-born Coda left. Majestrix Andromache was among the Coda fighting Grifter and his allies and died in the explosion. Recently, in the pages of ''Majestic'', [[Mister Majestic]] and Zealot have encountered Kherubim Coda Warriors on Earth. Also the Coda-traitor Charis (known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]) recently joined forces with the former WildC.A.T.s in the pages of ''Wildcats: Nemesis''. During the ''Wildstorm Armageddon'' story line The few remaining Coda were gathered up by the thought long dead Devin, formerly excommunicated acolyte of their order who survived into obscurity until the end of the world occurred. Gathering up the few remaining Coda survivors of the Post Apocalyptic world to create her own sisterhood, with her as Majestrix, which expanded its numbers through the weary travelers and soccer moms looking for safe respite that only her sect could provide, all while keeping any capable males captured as breeding labor in order to proliferate their ranks; Devin would eventually come into conflict with a past [[Caitlin Fairchild]] and her weathered survivor friends of [[Gen 13]].

==Notable members==
*Andromache, Kheran Majestrix of the Coda on Earth. Presumed dead.
*Artemis, a Kheran general who followed Zealot to Earth.
*Olympia Atreides, WildC.A.T.S. member and possibly the sole [[Daemonite]] Coda.
*Baroness Destine, killed by Zealot.
*Christine Blaze, Agent of [[International Operations]], infiltrated the Coda.
*Cassandra, Coda warrior stationed in the Himalayas. She killed Susanna Chaste and in return was killed by [[Divine Right (comic)|Max Faraday]] using her life-energy to resurrect Susanna. 
*Cordelia, Matriarch of the Coda and ruler of Melanesia. Former ally of [[Team 7]].
*Delphae, the Coda mystic/shaman with the power to open teleportation portals.
*Devin, disfigured assassin charged to capture Voodoo. Thought to have been expired in the second attempt but survives unto the future World's End event as Majestrix of remaining coda.
*The Grand Sarin, Coda assassin in special powered armour. Said to be the best assassin among the Earth-born Coda. Killed by Grifter in [[Ladytron (comics)|Ladytron]]'s body.
*[[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]], sole male Coda.
*Lady Harmony, mother of Lady Zannah and head of the Kheran Coda sect called the Skein. She was killed in battle.

*[[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]] (real name: Charis), a member of the Adrastea class from [[Kherubim|Khera]].
*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]], former Majestrix of the Coda of Earth

Note: both [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] and [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] have had Coda-training, but neither have devoted themselves enough to be considered true Coda warriors.

'''''Creatures''''' is an [[artificial life]] (alife) [[computer program]] series, created in the mid-1990s by English [[computer science|computer scientist]] [[Steve Grand (roboticist)|Steve Grand]] whilst working for the [[Cambridge]] [[video game]]s developer [[Millennium Interactive]]. Gameplay focuses on raising alien creatures known as Norns, teaching them to survive, helping them explore their world, defending them against other species, and breeding them. Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it. After a creature understands language, the player can instruct their creature by typing in instructions, which the creature may choose to obey.  A complete life cycle is modelled for the creatures - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and senescence, each with their own particular needs.  The gameplay is designed to foster an emotional bond between the player and their creatures.  Rather than taking a scripted approach, Creatures series games were driven by detailed biological and neurological simulation and their unexpected results. There were six major Creatures releases from Creature Labs. Between 1996 and 2001, there were three principal games released, the Docking Station add-on (generally referenced as a separate game) and two children's games, and there were three games created for console systems.  A sequel named ''Creatures Online'' was in development, with the artificial life technology from Creatures 3 and Docking Station updated to a 3D environment.

The [[genetics]] in ''Creatures'' are somewhat different from [[physical anthropology|human genetics]]; they are [[haploid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_genetics_preview_kit2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980126091513/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_genetics_preview_kit2.htm |archivedate=1998-01-26 |title=GENETICS PREVIEW KIT - REFERENCE GUIDE |publisher=Cyberlife |date=1998-01-26 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no concept of [[dominant gene]] and [[recessive gene]], much less [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between [[locus (genetics)|loci]]. Nevertheless, the complexity of the simulated biochemistry meant that Norn behaviour was highly unpredictable.

''Creatures'' was developed as a consumer product by [[Millennium Interactive|Millennium]], and was released by [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape]] in 1996. The program was instantly successful,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and an [[online community]] of players soon formed, swapping Norns, creating new objects for Albia,&lt;ref name="Jepsen C2"/&gt; sharing tips on how to play the game and anecdotes about unexpected evolutionary changes that they had seen, and even creating new [[Selective breeding|breeds]] of Norn. At one point, the Creatures online community was the largest of its type.

In 1996, ''Creatures'' won an EMMA Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emma-foundation.org/prevWin.asp?section=1996 |title=1996 Winners |publisher=The International EMMA Awards |date=2000-11-21 |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420074653/http://www.emma-foundation.org/prevWin.asp?section=1996 |archivedate=2001-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/cyberlife_awards2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970607011020/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/cyberlife_awards2.htm |archivedate=1997-06-07 |title=CREATURES WINS INTERNATIONAL EMMA AWARD |publisher=cyberlife.co.uk |date=1997-06-07 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on sales of 500,000 copies of ''Creatures'' from 1996 through to the second quarter of 1998, it was estimated that at that time, there was a possible global population of up to five million norns.&lt;ref name=TCGDE/&gt;

Development of ''[[Creatures 2]]'' began in Q3 1997.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"/&gt;  In 1998, the video games division of [[Millennium Interactive|Millennium]] was sold to Sony Entertainment while those working on alife and ''Creatures'' formed a new company called Cyberlife Technology. Along with continued work on the ''Creatures'' titles, the company did work for industry and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]], famously attempting to teach live organisms to fly virtual [[fighter jet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/ns/980509/features.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117012705/http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980509/features.html |archivedate=1999-01-17 |title=New Scientist Planet Science: Agents from Albia |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=1999-01-17 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/richard.pdf |title=Norn Attacks and Marine Doom |publisher= |author=BIRGIT RICHARD |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures 2'' was nominated in the Artificial Intelligence category of the [[Game Developers Conference]]'s Spotlight Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/Newstand/newsletters/ns_news_stuff_current.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010211202533/http://www.creatures.co.uk/Newstand/newsletters/ns_news_stuff_current.htm |title=Stuff&amp;NORNsense |publisher=Creatures.co.uk |archivedate=2001-02-11 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Grand left Cyberlife to form Cyberlife Research and focus on the production of new alife technologies, including work on a [[robotics|robotic]] life form he called Lucy as well as writing books about his research. The remainder of the company was renamed Creature Labs, and focused on [[video game development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=17_0_6_0_M8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517100548/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=17_0_6_0_M8 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Creature Labs |publisher=Gamewaredevelopment.com |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequels to ''Creatures'', including ''Creatures 2'', ''[[Creatures 3]]'' and the small-children's games ''Creatures Adventures'' and ''Creatures Playground'', were released by Creature Labs in subsequent years. ''Creatures Adventures'' won an EMMA Award in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emma-foundation.org/prevWin.asp?section=2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010421032520/http://www.emma-foundation.org/prevWin.asp?section=2000 |archivedate=2001-04-21 |title=2000 Winners |publisher=The International EMMA Awards |date=2001-04-21 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures Playground'' was exhibited at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creaturelabs.com/creaturelabs/news/news_playground.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20010417093344/http://www.creaturelabs.com/creaturelabs/news/news_playground.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 April 2001 |title=Creatures Playground gets first outing at E3 in Los Angeles |publisher=Creature Labs |date=5 May 2000 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nominated for a [[BAFTA award]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/bafta/5_ie/5_NOMINATIONS_2000.htm |title=Interactive Entertainment Awards 2000 |publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts |accessdate=2012-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001214014300/http://www.bafta.org/bafta/5_ie/5_NOMINATIONS_2000.htm |archivedate=2000-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creaturelabs.com/creaturelabs/news/news_BAFTA.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20010413232223/http://www.creaturelabs.com/creaturelabs/news/news_BAFTA.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 April 2001 |title=Creatures Playground nominated for BAFTA |publisher=Creature Labs |date=4 October 2000 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final major ''Creatures'' release, ''Docking Station'', was made available for download from the company's web site in 2001.&lt;ref name="highlights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010522113910/http://www.creatures.co.uk/ |archivedate=2001-05-22 |title=Highlights |publisher=The Creatures Community |date=2001-05-22 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development was suspended on future ''Creatures'' games on March 20, 2003, when Creature Labs ceased operations, but development and trademark rights have since been purchased by Gameware Development, Ltd. Gameware has revived the Creatures Developer Network, the shop, the forums, the Docking Station server, and has released many before-purchasable tools and add-ons for free.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/diary.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517015602/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/diary.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Gameware Development |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gameware staff that previously worked on ''Creatures'' developed a convergent media game for the [[BBC]] called ''[[BAMZOOKi]]''.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"/&gt;

In 2004, the ''Creatures'' games have been re-released in combination packs under the names ''Creatures: The Albian Years'' (C1, C2), ''Creatures Exodus'' (C3, DS) and ''Creatures Village'' (CA, CP). The Albian Years, and Exodus include the separate games, whereas Village has merged Adventures and Playground into a single game.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"/&gt;

[[Kutoka Interactive]], a Canadian children's software company, has created releases of ''Creatures Exodus'' (Kutoka) and ''Creatures Village'' (Kutoka Kids) that are compatible with both Apple's [[Mac OS X]] and [[Windows XP]].&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"/&gt; They were released on 30 September 2005, and can be purchased either directly from Kutoka or from other online stores.

In November 2009, [[GOG.com]] announced that they were offering ''Creatures: The Albian Years'', ''Creatures Exodus'' and ''Creatures Village'' for sale on their site as digital downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/en/news/new_release_creatures/2009/11 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124125929/http://www.gog.com/en/news/new_release_creatures/2009/11 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-24 |title=News - New release: Creatures |publisher=GOG.com |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, ''Creatures 3: Raised in Space'', a [[PlayStation One]] game, was re-released on the [[PlayStation Plus]] service.&lt;ref name="EUapril11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2011/04/06/the-biggest-playstation-plus-month-yet/ |title=The Biggest PlayStation Plus Month Yet |publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]] |date=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic gameplay consists of hatching some creatures, usually norns, and guiding them to reach maturity and to breed more creatures, with the goal of a more intelligent future population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2874/designers_notebook_more_sexes_.php |title=Features - Designer's Notebook: More Sex(es) in Computer Games |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it.

===Species===
;Norns

A Norn is an AIL (Artificial intelligent life) species, the development and survival of which constitute the main thematic elements of the program.

Norns are playful, all-trusting, naive creatures that love to explore. This is often the reason for their downfall, suffering, and death. They are more susceptible to disease in comparison to Ettins and Grendels, and in old age they may fall prey to a wasting disease that prevents them from absorbing certain nutrients.

Grand wished Norns to be endearing and for players to keep them as pets - that they should be independent and stubborn, like toddlers, and that the design of the norn should be appealing to as many people as possible, and that the player should care about the norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_norn.htm |title=The evolution of a species |publisher=Creatures.org.uk |date=March 1994 |accessdate=2012-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010212093320/http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_norn.htm |archivedate=2001-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewers have compared the Norns' visual design to the Mogwai of the ''[[Gremlins]]'' film series.&lt;ref name="Jepsen C2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jepsen|first=Dawn|title=They're Dead, Jim: Natural Selection Goes Awry in This Depressing Update|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=January 1999|issue=174|pages=364, 366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwinnable.com/2012/01/27/playing-god-on-death-motherhood-and-creatures/#more-26486 |title=Playing God: On Death, Motherhood and ‘Creatures’ |author=Frank, Jenn |publisher=Unwinnable |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shee originally created the Norns as a mixture of [[valet]] and pet.

It may also be a sign of how the Shee fared in their attempt to find a habitable planet.

In the games, the Norns have their own simulated biochemistry, haploid genetics, and [[neural network]] to serve as a brain. From Creatures 2 onwards, Norns also possess organs determined by their genetics;&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"/&gt; mutation and injury can render these defunct, with typically fatal consequences. Each of these has grown somewhat over the course of the series, allowing the creatures to become more complex and intelligent. Norns are omnivores and eat a variety of foods, including carrots, lemons, seeds, insects, fish, honey, and other things. The Norns that the player starts with require some degree of training and discipline from the player in order to make good decisions to maintain their health; however, later on they can evolve to be more independent and hardy, with better-developed instincts and a more robust biochemistry. The player can take advantage of this to breed certain colours or traits through artificial selection, and through many generations the changes can become quite pronounced.

Norns are very social animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jepsen|first=Dawn|title=It's Alive: ''Creatures'' Is Bound To Tickle Your Fancy|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=November 1997|issue=160|pages=314–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes to the extent that they will prefer to play with other norns than to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971016000951/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_june2.htm |url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_june2.htm |title=Creatures Newsletter June p.2 |publisher=Cyberlife |archivedate=1997-10-16 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312050032/http://worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/creature.htm |url=http://worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/creature.htm |title=Creatures |publisher=Gamer's Zone |author=Meinfelder, Edmond |archivedate=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Shee
[[File:Shee statue.png|thumb|right|The statue of a Shee in ''[[Creatures 2]]''. This is one of very few official in-game appearances of the Shee. (There are more hidden deeper in.)]]
The Shee are a race of absent-minded scientists. They are the original inhabitants of Albia, and the creators of the Norns, Ettins, and Grendels.

The Shee are all inventors, and make most of their inventions to save time on tasks that would have taken but a few minutes otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_shee.htm |title=Shee Mystery Unfolds |publisher=creatures.org.uk |accessdate=2012-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001214182000/http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_shee.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of their discoveries are made by accident, and as such, they sequenced their own [[DNA]] and eliminated all genetic defects, before discovering the wheel.

Millennia ago, the Shee had left the disk-shaped world of Albia, as they desired to live on a "more spherical world". They created the Shee Ark, took along some Norns, Ettins, and various animals and plants, and set out for their new home. The Shee Ark, like all Shee spacecraft, was itself a living creature grown from scratch, and used "Bioenergy" (the energy of living things, used to balance the game) to perform its various functions.

Early concepts of the Shee had them as merely a more advanced life form than the Norns, not their creators.&lt;ref name=definitivearticle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/definitivearticle.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927203105/http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/definitivearticle.htm |author=Grand, Steve |archivedate=2008-09-27 |title=Small Furry Creatures: The Definitive Article |publisher=Cyberlife Research |date=4 November 1994 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ettins
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ettin.jpg|thumb|left|123px|An Ettin from [[Creatures|Creatures 3]].]] --&gt;Ettins are a species in ''[[Creatures 2]]'' and ''[[Creatures 3]]''.

Ettins were created by the Shee to help them on their experiments, especially when using machinery. They made them like machines so much, they tend to steal bits for themselves, often taking them to wherever they consider their home.

''C2'' Ettins behave rather differently; they tend to lead a sad and lonely life underground with no one but Pitz and the occasional Grendel for company. The backstory in the guides and manual, as well as the opening sequence, reveals that they once lived in the desert at the top of Albia and, true to their nature, built the pyramid that sits there. The actual use (if any) of the pyramid is unknown.

Ettins were introduced into the ''Creatures'' series in ''C2'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/creatures2_news1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206040212/http://www.creatures.co.uk/creatures2_news1.htm |archivedate=1998-12-06 |title=Creatures 2 Newsletter 1. |publisher=creatures.org.uk |date=1998-12-06 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been revealed to the world after the volcanic eruption.

An early concept of the Ettins described them as insignificant "small, lizard-like creatures", who were often kept as pets by Norns.&lt;ref name=mythography/&gt;

The Ettins in ''Creatures 2'' were infertile; however, in ''Creatures 3'', there were two Ettins aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both female), and it was possible to get them to breed if two of them were placed in the Gene Splicer machine to create a male Ettin.

An in-depth exploration of the genetics and neurology of the Ettins in ''Creatures 2'' revealed that they were constantly in pain, apparently by design. This discovery was met by fan uproar.

;Grendels
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:C2 Grendelimage.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Creatures 2]] Grendel]] --&gt;
Grendels are the green-skinned, red-eyed antagonists of the Norns, over which the player has little control, stealing food and injuring individual Norns. They also carry diseases harmful to Norns.&lt;ref name=TCGDE/&gt;  The early concepts of their appearance described them as "resembling a huge, titanium spider".&lt;ref name=mythography/&gt;

In the unmodified ''Creatures 1'' and ''2'', Grendels do not reproduce, being born infertile. Generally, only one Grendel is alive in the world of Albia at a time. In ''Creatures 3'', two Grendels were alive aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both male), but it was possible to get them to breed and have offspring if both were placed in the Gene Splicer machine and used to create a female Grendel.

In all three games, Grendels are automatically produced by a "Mother" machine; in ''Creatures 3'', however, it is possible to ensure that there are no Grendels in the game by killing any existing grendels (e.g. in the [[airlock]]) and then waiting by the mother, then placing any eggs into water (the [[piranha]] pool) so that they cannot hatch.

The Grendels were another genetically engineered creation of the Shee, albeit an accidental one. They were certainly not what the Shee were trying to get as a result from their experiments, and were considered to be harmful, useless monsters. However, some of the evil Shee (known as the Banshee) believed the Grendels were genetically superior to the Norns, and kept some for improvement.

It is possible to cross a Norn with a Grendel, creating a 'Grenorn'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/news/topstories/0,1287,5037,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011129065439/http://www.wired.com/news/topstories/0%2C1287%2C5037%2C00.html |archivedate=2001-11-29 |title=Digital DNA Swap Meet |publisher=Wired.com |date=2001-11-29 |accessdate=2012-12-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971015235359/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_july.htm |url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_july.htm |title=Creatures July Newsletter Page 1 |publisher=Cyberlife |archivedate=1997-10-15 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creatures community has appeared to adopt the Grendel as an underdog figure, creating a "Grendel Liberation Front" - despite being intended to add stress to Norns' lives, players began to tame their Grendels.&lt;ref name=TCGDE/&gt;

===User Interface===
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
In each of the games, players interact with the world through the use of a graphical hand as the player's mouse in the main visual area of the game. In ''Creatures'' and ''Creatures 2'', players can use applets in a toolbar, often called Kits, along the top of the game window, to access many functions, such as getting their first norn eggs, naming and photographing their norns, monitoring the health and general biochemistry of the norns and administering medicines, monitoring pregnancies, injecting objects into the world, and recording deceased norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_toolbar.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971016002046/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_toolbar.htm |archivedate=1997-10-16 |title=THE CREATURES TOOLBAR. |publisher=Cyberlife |date=1997-10-16 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C1Manual.pdf |title=Creatures Deluxe Breeder's Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224453/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C1Manual.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures 2'' introduced an Ecology Kit and Neuroscience Kit.&lt;ref name=C2manual&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C2Manual.pdf |title=Creatures 2 Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232906/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C2Manual.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Creature 3 and Docking Station, players still use a hand as their mouse to interact with creatures and the world, but the main game area does not have toolbars like in Creatures and Creatures 2, but instead has areas along the sides of the screens with buttons that the user can press to move to different locations, view the current creatures in the world, manage an inventory of items, and change game settings.

Charlie Brooker regarded the level of detail shown in the monitoring kits as "terrifying",&lt;ref name="Brooker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooker|first=Charlie|title=Creatures|url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2854/creatures|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120064244/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2854/creatures|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 January 2013|publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|date=12 Aug 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been argued that the detailed monitoring kits highlight the artificiality of the norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meer|first1=Alec|title=Have You Played… Creatures?|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/20/have-you-played-creatures/|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Smith disliked the limitation of C1 that the player is "limited to seeing areas that you've tagged as favorite places or that are currently inhabited by Norns," and found it difficult to correctly reward and punish the creatures.&lt;ref name="cdmag2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/013/creatures_review.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031027104034/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/013/creatures_review.html|archivedate=2003-10-27 |title=Creatures Review |author=Smith, Peter |publisher=[[Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |date=1998-01-31 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creatures 2 introduced an angel and devil glyph which appears next to the hand to show you whether you are about to reward or punish your creature.&lt;ref name="C2manual" /&gt; Jim Brumbaugh, in reviewing ''Creatures'', disliked the amount of typing that was needed to communicate with the creatures, but found the menu system "highly user friendly." He noted also that there was only one way that the player could save, when the player exited the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avault.com/reviews/print_review.asp?game=creatur |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303193810/http://www.avault.com/reviews/print_review.asp?game=creatur |title=Creatures |publisher=Adrenaline Vault |date=July 16, 1997 |archivedate=2006-03-03 |accessdate=2012-12-08 |author=Brumbaugh, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Walou praised the simplified user interface of ''Creatures 4'', saying that earlier games felt like you had to have your [[Bachelor's degree|BAC]] to understand.&lt;ref name="Walou" /&gt; Kahn Lusth, writing for [[Canard PC]], enjoyed the new interface of ''Creatures Online'' for communicating with creatures, where with a click of the mouse the player can choose suggestions to guide their creatures, describing it as more convenient than typing keywords.&lt;ref name="CanardPC" /&gt; To improve the ergonomics on the [[iOS]] system, a 'rubber-band' system has been created for ''Creatures Online'', where the player draws a line between the norn and an object.

===Environment===
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
While the initial pitch was for a desktop pet that could interact with other Windows programs, for example, [[Windows Media Player]],&lt;ref name=initialpitch/&gt; as the game developed, the need for a self-contained world became more apparent.  The world was named "Albia", after [[Albion]], and one of the goals of gameplay became to explore Albia.&lt;ref name=rationale/&gt;&lt;ref name=definitivearticle/&gt;  Grand thought that having the creatures inhabit a rich, "messy", world, and to be able to interact with it in many ways would help creatures' personalities to emerge.&lt;ref name="grand352"/&gt;  The backdrop for ''Creatures'' was created by taking photographs of a physical model of the world,&lt;ref name=mainhistory/&gt; part of which is now housed at [[The Centre for Computing History]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/42694/Creatures-Model/ Creatures Model - Computing History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world is rendered in [[2.5D]], and the world can smoothly scroll to follow a creature.  The world contains many different items, which creatures can interact with in a variety of ways.  Objects are written using an [[object-oriented programming]] technique - each item has their own scripts which determine how they interact with creatures and with other objects.  Objects are detected by a creature by being in its line of sight, which excites a neuron dedicated to that class of objects.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrl.snu.ac.kr/courses/CourseSyntheticCharacter/grand96creatures.pdf |title=Creatures: Artificial Life Autonomous Software Agents for Home Entertainment |author1=Grand, Steve |author2=Cliff, Dave |author3=Mahotra, Anil. |year=1996 |publisher=Millennium Technical Report 9601; University of Sussex Technical Report CSRP434 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object-oriented approach means that the games are highly [[Mod (video gaming)|modifiable]].&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;  Some of the items in the world are dangerous to norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Bonnie|title=Creatures|url=http://www.elecplay.com/pc/creatures.html|publisher=[[The Electronic Playground]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970801040044/http://www.elecplay.com/pc/creatures.html|archivedate=1 August 1997|date=June 11, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Creatures 2'', the environment became more complex, with a "Complete working eco-system, including weather, seasons and a functioning food-chain. The plants seed and spread around the environment if conditions allow. The result of this is a very "real" feeling world that adapts around the player."&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"/&gt;

In ''Creatures 3'' and ''Docking Station'', the game was set on a spaceship.  The environment became more segmented into areas called "metarooms", small biomes, each with their own ecosystem.  Players could download and add new metarooms to their games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C3manual.pdf |title=Creatures 3 Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/DSManual.pdf |title=Creatures Docking Station Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games in the series==
&lt;!-- going to mix this section so it flows better (and find the missing dates), and have an overview of each of the three parts. feel free to jump in and help. --&gt;

There were six major ''Creatures'' releases from Creature Labs. In addition to the three principal games, the ''Docking Station'' add-on (generally referenced as a separate game) and two children's games were released.

===''On Albia'' (later re-released as ''Creatures: The Albian Years'')===

====''Creatures''====
The original ''Creatures'' game, released in the United Kingdom and Australia in November 1996 and in North America in July 1997, took place on the fictional disc-shaped world Albia. While the "faces" of the disc were uninhabitable, the "rim" of Albia was home to a complicated [[natural environment|environment]] much like Earth's. Here lay an abandoned system of [[laboratory|laboratories]] left over by the Shee, an advanced race that had suddenly left the planet many years earlier in order to find a more stable world. In these laboratories and environments, the player was able to hatch new Norns from leftover [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and re-inhabit the world of Albia. According to Millenium, every copy of ''Creatures'' contains a unique starting set of eggs, whose genomes are not replicated on any other copy of the game.&lt;ref name="NGen23"/&gt; An expansion pack, called "Life Kit #1" was released for purchase later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/034/lifekit_review.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705043628/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/034/lifekit_review.html |archivedate=2003-07-05 |title=Creatures Life Kit #1 Review |author=Smith, Peter |publisher=[[Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |date=1998-01-31 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Creatures'' sold 100,000 copies by November 1997. At the time, John Moore of Mindscape explained that the company "expect[s] to sell more than 200,000 ''Creatures'' by the end of the year."&lt;ref name=sales1&gt;{{cite web | author=Anderson, Jill | title=Mindscape Sells 100,000 ''Creatures'' | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000520041544/http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_11/03_creature/index.html | url=http://headline.gamespot.com:80/news/97_11/03_creature/index.html | archivedate=May 20, 2000 | work=[[GameSpot]] | date=November 3, 1997 | deadurl=yes | access-date=August 3, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Creatures 2''====

[[File:Creatures 2 game new Norn.PNG|right|thumb|Creatures 2 added 16-bit graphics and a larger world]]

''[[Creatures 2]]'', released on September 30, 1998, took place many years after the first game, after a devastating [[natural disaster]] (or, as explained in later games, a devastating Shee disaster) had changed the [[landscape]] of Albia dramatically and opened up new areas of the world. New [[technology]] and [[species]] were made available to the [[Player (game)|player]], and the creatures themselves had been provided with "considerably more sensory input, more actions they can take, and improved brain dynamics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|date=July 1998|title=Creatures 2|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the great change in environment, including a "complete working eco-system",&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3271/from_creatures_to_androids.php |title=Features - From Creatures to Androids |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the focus of the game remained the same. Creatures 2 Deluxe (with Life Kit) soon followed.  200,000 copies of ''Creatures 2'' were immediately shipped upon its release.&lt;ref name=TCGDE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cliff|first=Dave|author2=Grand, Stephen|title=The Creatures Global Digital Ecosystem|journal=Artificial Life|year=1999|volume=5|issue=1|pages=77–93|doi=10.1162/106454699568683|pmid=10421678}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two expansion packs, Life Kit 1 and Life Kit 2, were released for C2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=447_0_8_0_M15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517102057/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=447_0_8_0_M15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Creatures 2 Life Kit 1 |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=34_0_8_0_M15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517102035/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=34_0_8_0_M15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Creatures 2 Life Kit 2 |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures 2'' was considered "much more difficult" than ''C1'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarkson|first=Mark|title=Creatures 2: Power-ups and Help on How to Keep Your Norns Alive|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=February 1999|issue=175|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new, more challenging environment and norn biology was described as frustrating, but that after installing a new genome and going through successive generations, the Norns seemed smarter.&lt;ref name="Jepsen C2"/&gt;  Nick Walkland described the gameplay as a "labour of love", noting that the challenge was to sustain your Norns' lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walkland|first=Nick|title=Creatures 2|url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2856/creatures-2|publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|date=12 Aug 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119175808/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2856/creatures-2|archivedate=19 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sid Fisk of Gamezilla criticized the audio for Creatures 2 for not alerting him when his creature was near-death, but playing a "funeral dirge" as the body left the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisk|first1=Sid|title=Creatures 2 by Mindscape &amp; Cyberlife Technology Ltd.|url=http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/c/creatures2.asp|website=Gamezilla|accessdate=10 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010622224025/http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/c/creatures2.asp|archivedate=22 June 2001|date=24 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''After Leaving Albia'' (later re-released as ''Creatures Exodus'')===

====''Creatures 3''====
''[[Creatures 3]]'', released on November 4, 1999, took a detour from the first two games. It took place on the [[starship|spaceship]] that the Shee had used to flee Albia. The ship was divided into many carefully controlled [[natural environment|environment]]s (Norn Terrarium, Jungle Terrarium, Desert Terrarium, Marine Terrarium). ''Creatures 3'' was much more technologically focused, including many agents which could be connected in various ways to perform tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000821070502/http://www.gamecenter.com/Reviews/Item/Cont/0%2C7%2C0-3763_2%2C00.html |url=http://www.gamecenter.com/Reviews/Item/Cont/0,7,0-3763_2,00.html |title=Creatures 3 |publisher=Game Center.com |archivedate=2000-08-21 |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the goal was to [[experiment]] with the three principal species and create a living world out of an empty ship.  ''Creatures 3'' included a "new social element",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2857/creatures-3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121042538/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2857/creatures-3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-21 |title=Creatures 3 &amp;#124; ComputerAndVideoGames.com |publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] |date=2001-08-12 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which norns could remember relationships they've formed with other creatures better.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment3"/&gt;

====''Docking Station''====
The final major ''Creatures'' release was ''Docking Station'', an [[Internet]]-based add-on to ''Creatures 3'', released free of charge on the ''Creatures'' web site on March 27, 2001.&lt;ref name="highlights"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2001/03/27/creatures-gets-new-creatures |title=Creatures Gets New Creatures |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended as a way to sell ''Creatures 3'' (you could dock the worlds of the two games together, hence the name ''"Docking" Station'') and extra packs of Norn breeds. ''Docking Station'' has an intermittent reminder screen that encourages users to buy ''Creatures 3''.

''Docking Station'' added the possibility of interaction between individual player worlds; Norns could 'travel' to other online worlds via a central server, players could [[online chat|chat]] to other online players, and it was possible to track Norns (and their offspring) that had been present in their worlds via the ''Docking Station'' website.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment4"/&gt; While ''Docking Station'' was released late in the series' run, it changed gameplay (and the potential of the series) dramatically. One reviewer stated that it opened up a whole new world for her online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010607075048/http://gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18445.htm |url=http://gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18445.htm |title=Creatures Docking Station
 |publisher=GameZone |archivedate=2001-06-07 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer criticised the online portion of the game, as it requires the player to find online buddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cadotte|first=Joseph|title=Creatures: Exodus|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=664 |publisher=[[Inside Mac Games]] |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Docking Station also expanded considerably on the game mythos, including the introduction of an 'anti-Shee', the Banshee (a Grendel/Shee hybrid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creaturelabs.com/creatures/expansion/banshee.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20021208182711/http://www.creaturelabs.com/creatures/expansion/banshee.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-12-08 |title=The Banshee Grendels |publisher=Creature Labs |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Creatures Online''===
''Creatures Online'' was a planned sequel to the game, which was being developed by Fishing Cactus. The game was announced as ''Creatures 4'' in Fishing Cactus's blog in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2011/05/18/announcing-creatures-4-on-ios-mac-and-pc/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » Announcing Creatures 4 on iOS, Mac and PC |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2011-05-18 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creatures Online was to have 5 worlds, was to be completely in 3D graphics instead of [[2.5D]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; pre-rendered graphics, and in-game currency was planned to buy Norns toys, food, etc. Creatures Online was designed to be a [[free-to-play]] game.  A collector's edition box was also announced with a Norn figurine, the three original games for current PCs, and all the money you paid for the game as in-game money for your Norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2011/08/22/the-uncensored-truth-about-creatures-4/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » The uncensored truth about Creatures 4 |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Creatures 4 entered an in-house [[alpha test|alpha phase]] in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2013/02/21/creatures-4-qa-with-the-designers-alpha-test/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » Creatures 4: Q&amp;A with the devs &amp; Alpha-test |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2013-02-21 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The internal systems of the creatures from C3/DS were retained and updated for the 3D environment.&lt;ref name=Walou&gt;{{cite news|last=Walou|first=Eddie|title=Des norns, des neurones, et des euros|newspaper=[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]|pages=50–51|language=French| date=November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creatures-online.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=195&amp;p=1698#p1698 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518095035/http://creatures-online.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=195&amp;p=1698 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 May 2016 |title=Forum • View topic - the 3d... whats up with it |publisher=Creatures Online Official Site |author=Di Stefano, Andrea |date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Norns' fur patterns were to be partially [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]], with the goal of ensuring "that no two Norns look alike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2013/01/22/creatures-4-dev-update-the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » Creatures 4 Dev Update: The Light at the End of the Tunnel |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Heterochromia iridum]] has been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2013/03/22/creatures-4-procedural-fur-patterns/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » Creatures 4 : Procedural Fur Patterns |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2013-03-22 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The norns of Creatures Online will have a new [[drive theory|drive]], tentatively called "[[Altruism in animals|altruism]]", which encourages them to do things which will benefit the norn colony, like tending to plants and fixing broken toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creatures-online.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=303&amp;p=2423#p2423 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029183951/http://creatures-online.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=303&amp;p=2423 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 October 2013 |author=Di Stefano, Andrea |title=Forum • View topic - PGW 2012 Demo Video |publisher=Creatures Online Official Site |date=24 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Creatures 4" was renamed "Creatures Online" in May 2013.&lt;ref name="CreaturesOnline"/&gt;  Creatures Online, unlike earlier entries in the Creatures series,&lt;ref name="facebook2013"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Mika, Andrea di Stefano, Samuel Languy |year=2013 |title=Aug 24, 2013 5:55am  |medium=Interview  |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10201731082140120 |accessdate=7 September 2013 |time=1.52 |publisher=Creatures Online |location=Facebook |quote= Samuel Languy: "A lot of players liked to play it but didn't really know what - 'Is it a game, is it not?'

===''Younger Children's Games'' (later re-released as ''Creatures Village'')===

====''Creatures Adventures''====
Released in 2000, and targeted at younger children (ages 6–9), ''Creatures Adventures'' dropped the complex interface of the main series in favour of brighter graphics and a more childlike atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=James|title=Creatures Adventures|journal=[[PC Zone]]|date=1999|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Creatures Playground''====
The second game in the younger children's series, ''Creatures Playground'' (released the same year), could be connected to Adventures to create an even bigger world to explore.  It has a theme park for the creatures, including mini-games like whack-a-mole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schofield|first1=Jack|author-link=Jack Schofield (journalist)|title=Games reviews|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/nov/16/onlinesupplement4|date=16 November 2000 |accessdate=6 August 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Console games===
The ''Creatures'' concept was made into three different games for consoles: ''[[Creatures (Game Boy Advance game)|Creatures]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and ''[[Creatures (PlayStation game)|Creatures]]'' and ''[[Creatures: Raised in Space]]'' for [[PlayStation]].  In the PlayStation games, the hand is replaced by a [[fairy]] named Scrubby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roper|first=Chris|title=Creatures Review|url=http://ign.com/articles/2002/09/23/creatures-review|publisher=IGN |date=23 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the limited processing power of the early-day consoles, the [[AI]] had to be completely reprogrammed by the console development team around [[Volker Eloesser]]. A fourth, ''Project Loci'', was in development at the time of Creatures Labs' liquidation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicelytoasted.net/honey/archives/002107.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030826062030/http://www.nicelytoasted.net/honey/archives/002107.html |archivedate=2003-08-26 |title=Portfolio: Creatures Project Loci |author=de Araujo, Lisa |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-08-26 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was cancelled for lack of funds.  ''Loci'' would have been the first ''Creatures'' game for the PS2, Xbox and GameCube.

==Later bundled releases==
There have been various re-releases of the ''Creatures'' games. The later re-releases from Gameware improved Windows XP compatibility by allowing them to run easily under non-administrator accounts and without the use of the  compatibility mode, but break compatibility with some third-party content without the use of a third-party patch.

;''Creatures Trilogy'' / ''Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection''
This release of ''Creatures Trilogy'' included ''Creatures'', ''Creatures 2'', and ''Creatures 3'', as well as the ''Life Kit'' addons for the earlier games. It was released before ''Docking Station'', but the version of ''Creatures 3'' included in this was identical to the original release (except that it was using the newest patch) and was therefore compatible with ''Docking Station''.

Encore Software released a ''Creatures Trilogy'' containing ''Creatures'', ''Creatures 2'', and ''Creatures 3'',&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/print.php?id=468_0_10_0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105173924/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/print.php?id=468_0_10_0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-01-05 |title=GameWare Development |publisher=GameWare Development |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; under their [[Encare]] line. They also released a "gold" version titled ''Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection''.

;''Creatures Internet Edition'' / ''Creatures Gold''
The final major ''Creatures'' release was a re-release in 2001 by FastTrak Software Publishing as ''Creatures Internet Edition'', a bundle of ''Creatures 3'', ''Creatures 3 Update 2'', ''Docking Station'', and a number of environment extras and tools (many with multilingual variants).&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment2"/&gt; [[Linux Game Publishing]] released a Linux port of ''Creatures Internet Edition'' a few months later in December 2001.

The original ''Creatures Internet Edition'' was released again in 2002 by [[Focus Multimedia]], without the physical manual, as ''Creatures Gold'', but the disc contents were identical (and so the installer and PDF manual both referred to it as ''Creatures Internet Edition'').

;''Creatures: The Albian Years''
''Creatures 1'' and ''[[Creatures 2]]'' on one disk, updated to run on Windows XP.

;''Creatures Exodus''
''[[Creatures 3]]'' and ''Docking Station'' plus a selection of new Norn breeds on one disk, updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows &amp; Mac dual-format, and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110517015344/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/ds/ds_more.php?id=552_0_16_0_C free downloadable] versions are also available.

;''Creatures Village''
''Creatures Adventures'' and ''Creatures Playground'', merged and updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows &amp; Mac dual-format versions are also available.

;''Creatures Triple Collection''
''Creatures Triple Pack'', otherwise known as ''Creatures Collection: Triple'', contains ''The Albian Years'', ''Creatures Exodus'' and ''Creatures Village'' for Windows.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
As of September 2017, the Creatures Community, or CC, is still very active online and in the games;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creaturescaves.com/index.php|title=Creatures Caves {{!}} Home |last=Rascii|website=creaturescaves.com|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the Community holds a festival called the Creatures Community Spirit Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creatures.org.uk/ccsf/|title=Creatures Community Spirit Festival|website=www.creatures.org.uk|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or CCSF, to celebrate the games and the community that has formed since the creation of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Denton|first1=Abby|title=Artificial life finds a way: the legacy of Creatures|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/12/creatures-fans-mods-artificial-life/|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players have always ranged in age and the enthusiasm for the games is still very high.

Several reviews of the series emphasise that the player will need patience,&lt;ref name="CNETreview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rita Courtney |url=http://www.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r12597.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010701213611/http://www.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r12597.htm |archivedate=2001-07-01 |title=GameZone.com - PC Game Reviews - Creatures 3 |publisher=Web.archive.org |year=2000 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hubble1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubble|first=Calvin|title=Creatures Review|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/creatures|publisher=Game Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fielder |first=Lauren |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/creatures-2-review/1900-2538465/ |title=Creatures 2 Review |publisher=GameSpot |date=1998-11-13 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recommend it for players who are not parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leonard |first=Andrew |title=The Game of Life |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/streetcred_pr.html |work=Street Cred |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127023401/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/streetcred_pr.html |archivedate=November 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgameplay.co.uk/reviews/puzzle/creatures3.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20010508111713/http://www.pcgameplay.co.uk/reviews/puzzle/creatures3.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-05-08 |title=Creatures 3 |date=2001-05-08 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early games do not have specific goals,&lt;ref name="facebook2013"/&gt; leading some reviewers to consider it a 'small scale genetic experiment' rather than a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|date=May 1997|title=Creatures|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer compares the game to a virtual '[[fish tank]]', feeling that once the frustration of raising norns through their childhood was over and a breeding population had been established, the game became boring for him.&lt;ref name="cdmag2003"/&gt;

Several reviewers compared Creatures favourably to [[Tamagotchi]] when Creatures first came out.&lt;ref name="hubble1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alderman |first=John |title=Tamagotchi, Schmamagotchi: Here Come the Norns |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/05/3639 |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |date=6 May 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013456/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/05/3639 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Caroline Daniel]], it is intriguing what our interactions with the game will reveal about us.  Furthermore, Daniel regarded the game as an important step in popularising artificial life technology in the home.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Caroline. "Little life forms to call your own." ''[[New Statesman]]'' 15 Nov. 1996: 12. Literature Resource Center. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between July and November 1997, over 100,000 copies of ''Creatures'' were sold in the American market. ''[[Windows Sources]]'' magazine gave the series a "Stellar Award".&lt;ref&gt;"Creatures Sells 100,000 Copies in Less Than 100 Days, Virtual Life Sim from Mindscape Continues to Fly off the Shelves." ''[[Business Wire]]'' 3 Nov. 1997: 11030074. General OneFile. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Schindler wondered if this game was entertainment or a simulation of parenthood.  Schindler criticised the inability to scroll all the way around the world.  Schindler also noted that raising a group of norns was much more difficult than raising a single norn, as they could interact with each other with much greater ease than he could interact with a norn.&lt;ref name=Schindler&gt;Schindler, Jay. "CREATURES." ''[[Simulation &amp; Gaming]]'' 29.4 (1998): 482. General OneFile. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Don Labriola wrote of ''Creatures'' that "no other program so successfully mirrors the joys and challenges of raising a child or pet."&lt;ref&gt;Labriola, Don. "Mindscape's Creatures brings artificial life to your desktop." ''[[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]]'' Nov. 1997: 290. General OneFile. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the ''Creatures'' series was featured by an academic study into science-themed video games as depicting an accurate model of evolution and natural selection, displaying three key features of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leith|first1=Alex|title=Playing a science-based video game?

Death – particularly the death of [[human]]s – has commonly been considered a [[sadness|sad]] or unpleasant occasion, due to the [[affection]] for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial [[human bonding|bonds]] with the deceased. Other concerns include [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[necrophobia]], [[anxiety]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], [[grief]], [[emotional pain]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], [[solitude]], or [[saudade]]. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an [[afterlife]], and also hold the idea of [[Heaven|reward]] or [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgement]] and [[Hell|punishment for past sin]].

== Etymology ==
The word death comes from [[Old English]] ''dēaþ'', which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *''dauþuz'' (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *''dheu-'' meaning the "process, act, condition of dying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |title=Death |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013162848/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated terms ==
[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death.  When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''expired'', or are ''gone'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and when all flesh has rotted away, a [[skeleton]]. The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of "decease", as in ''the deceased''; another noun form is ''decedent''.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a [[portmanteau]] of "cremation" and "remains".

== Senescence ==
[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|alt=A dead magpie|A dead [[Eurasian magpie]]]]

[[Senescence]] refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick &amp; Moody, 2003).

Almost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as "senescence". Some organisms experience [[negligible senescence]], even exhibiting [[biological immortality]].  These include the jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |title=Turritopsis nutricula (Immortal jellyfish) |publisher=Jellyfishfacts.net |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163459/http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], and the [[planarian]]. Unnatural causes of death include [[suicide]] and [[homicide]]. From all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aubrey D.N.J |first=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations |journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology |volume=1 |issue=1, Article 5 |year=2007 |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163622/http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90%, i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt;

[[Physiological]] death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crippen |first=David |website=Scientific American Surgery, Critical Care, April 2005 |url=http://www.sciamsurgery.com/sciamsurgery/institutional/payPerAdd.action?chapterId=part08_ch10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624132446/http://www.acssurgery.com/abstracts/acs/acs0812.htm |archivedate=24 June 2006 |title=Brain Failure and Brain Death |accessdate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of [[vital signs]]. In general, [[clinical death]] is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of [[legal death]]. A patient with working [[human heart|heart]] and [[human lung|lungs]] determined to be [[brain death|brain dead]] can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring. As [[science|scientific knowledge]] and [[medicine]] advance, formulating a precise medical definition of death becomes more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Death Whatever |first=Alexander |last=Artishevsky |publisher=Createspace |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4495-9420-6 }}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signs===
Signs of death or strong indications that a [[endotherm|warm-blooded animal]] is no longer alive are:
* [[Respiratory arrest]] (no [[breathing]])
* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
* [[Brain death]] (no neuronal activity)
* {{lang|la|[[Pallor mortis]]}}, paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
* {{lang|la|[[Livor mortis]]}}, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* {{lang|la|[[Algor mortis]]}}, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* {{lang|la|[[Rigor mortis]]}}, the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
* [[Decomposition]], the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518024043/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality%3B%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf |date=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.

It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see WP:CITE) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} In this context "death" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of "life" simultaneously defines death.

Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.

The category of "brain death" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: "By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant "brain-dead" women)."&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616–620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&amp;nbsp;– irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&amp;nbsp;– has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

===Legal===
{{See also|Legal death}}

The death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.
A [[death certificate]] is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.

===Misdiagnosed===
{{See also|Premature burial}}
[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]
There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&amp;nbsp;71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in [[England]] and [[Wales]], although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[electric shock]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned [[nerve]]s to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an [[emergency department|emergency room]].&lt;ref name=Limmer&gt;{{cite book|title=Brady Emergency Care AHA |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-159390-9 |author=Limmer, Dan; O'Keefe, Michael F.; Bergeron, J.

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be re-evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of information-theoretic death&lt;ref name="InfoDeath"&gt;{{cite web

There have been some scientific attempts to bring dead organisms back to life, but with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/28/blood-swapping-reanimates-dead-dogs/ |title=Blood Swapping Reanimates Dead Dogs |newspaper=Fox News |date=28 June 2005 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014135940/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/28/blood-swapping-reanimates-dead-dogs.html |archivedate=14 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--to find this if it goes dead: original url http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,160903,00.html--&gt; In [[science fiction]] [[scenario]]s where such technology is readily available, real death is distinguished from reversible death.

== Cause ==
{{See also|List of causes of death by rate|List of preventable causes of death}}

The leading cause of human death in [[developing countries]] is [[infectious disease]]. The leading causes in [[developed countries]] are [[atherosclerosis]] ([[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]), [[cancer]], and other diseases related to [[obesity]] and [[aging]]. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging,&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; leading to various complications known as [[aging-associated diseases]]. These conditions cause loss of [[homeostasis]], leading to [[cardiac arrest]], causing loss of [[oxygen]] and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the [[Human brain|brain]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; With improved medical capability, dying has become [[respite care|a condition to be managed]].

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] ([[United Nations]] Special Reporter on the Right to Food, 2000 – Mar 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality rate in 2006.

Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[physical fitness|physical activity]], but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human [[longevity]]. The [[evolution of aging|evolutionary cause of aging]] is, at best, only just beginning to be understood. It has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olshansky |first=S.

[[Hans Selye|Selye]] proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that [[Stress (biology)|stress]] decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, ''adaptation energy''. The animal dies when this resource is exhausted.&lt;ref name="SelyeAE2"&gt;Selye, H. (1938). Experimental evidence supporting the conception of "adaptation energy", Am. J. Physiol. 123 (1938), 758–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Selye assumed that  the adaptability is a finite supply, presented at birth. Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone B |year=1952 |title=The general practitioner and the general adaptation syndrome |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent works,  adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the "dominant path" in the model of adaptation. It is demonstrated that oscillations of well-being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gorban A.N. |author2=Tyukina T.A. |author3=Smirnova E.V. |author4=Pokidysheva L.I. |year=2016 |title=Evolution of adaptation mechanisms: adaptation energy, stress, and oscillating death|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287251014 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.12.017 |pmid=26801872 |journal=J.

=== Autopsy ===
[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of an autopsy, by Rembrandt, entitled "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp"|An autopsy is portrayed in ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
An [[autopsy]], also known as a ''postmortem examination'' or an ''obduction'', is a [[medical procedure]] that consists of a thorough [[Medical examination|examination]] of a human [[dead body|corpse]] to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any [[disease]] or [[injury]] that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].

Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.

A "necropsy" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.

== Cryonics ==
[[File:Cryo surgery.jpg|thumb|Technicians prepare a body for cryopreservation in 1985.]]
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]] (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKie|first=Robin |title=Cold facts about cryonics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science |newspaper=[[The Oalobserver]] |date=13 July 2002 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |quote="Cryonics, which began in the Fifties, is the freezing – usually in liquid nitrogen – of human beings who have been legally declared dead. The aim of this process is to keep such individuals in a state of refrigerated limbo so that it may become possible in the future to resuscitate them, cure them of the condition that killed them, and then restore them to functioning life in an era when medical science has triumphed over the activities of the Banana Reaper."

[[Cryopreservation]] of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology.

== Life extension ==
{{Main|Life extension}}

Life extension refers to an increase in [[maximum life span|maximum]] or [[life expectancy|average lifespan]], especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]]. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as "biomedical [[gerontologist]]s". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called "life extensionists" or "longevists". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.

In society, the nature of death and humanity's [[Mortality salience|awareness of its own mortality]] has for millennia been a concern of the world's [[religious traditions]] and of [[philosophy|philosophical inquiry]]. This includes belief in [[resurrection]] or an [[afterlife]] (associated with [[Abrahamic religions]]), [[reincarnation]] or rebirth (associated with [[Dharmic religions]]), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as [[eternal oblivion]] (associated with [[atheism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fuKB8MPMdG4C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Handbook to the Afterlife |last1=Heath |first1=Pamela Rae |last2=Klimo |first2=Jon |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2010 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-55643-869-1 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various [[mourning]], [[funeral]] practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[initialism]] RIP.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].

Legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.

[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]
[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004030535/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=4 October 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of [[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.

[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] God [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].

In [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204–220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.

== Consciousness ==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}

Much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''.

== In biology ==
[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]]
After death the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.

[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}

Contemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

{{Main|Extinction}}
[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W. Norton]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-393-31755-8 |pages=43–44 |chapter=Up to the Starting Line|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of [[Taxon|taxa]], reducing [[biodiversity]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly "reappear" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}

Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.

Organisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are "immortal" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In [[multicellular]] organisms (and also in [[multinucleate]] [[ciliates]]),&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Online Chapter 2: [http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780199657148/ The diversity of sexual cycles], p. 12. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist development]], that is, with a division of labor between mortal [[somatic cells|somatic (body) cells]] and "immortal" [[germ cell|germ (reproductive) cells]], death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert |first=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental biology |edition=7th |place=Sunderland, Mass |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=34–35 |isbn=978-0-87893-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Volvox]]'' algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its [[Biological life cycle|life history]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 |pmid=21174128 |pmc=3098969 |title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae |last=Hallmann |first=A. |journal=Sexual Plant Reproduction |date=June 2011 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
Death is an important subject of religious doctrine.

=== Buddhism ===
{{See also|Anussati#The ten recollections}}

In Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|"deathless"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain  enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.&lt;ref name="Blum 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name="Blum 2004" /&gt;

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}
Death is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.  Persons who come into contact with corpses are [[Tumah and taharah|ritually impure]].  There are a [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|variety of beliefs about the afterlife]] within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death.  This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any [[Mitzvah|commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;Soloveitchik, Joseph B.  ''Halakhic Man.'' Qtd. in [https://elmad.pardes.org/2018/04/tazria-metzora-understanding-purity/ Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Death and adjustment hypotheses''' ('''DAH''') is a theory about death and dying that focuses on [[death anxiety (psychology)]] and adjustment to death.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf Theories on Death and Dying]'', McGraw-Hill, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented by [[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] as an answer to the overwhelming anxiety and grief about death.&lt;ref&gt;Md Zakaria Siddique, "A review of ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''", ''Death Studies'', vol. 33, no. 2 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, and Fred Peterson (eds.). ''The Truth about Death and Dying''. 2nd ed. New York: DWJ Books, 2009, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to find the resolution to death anxiety, predominantly the existential one, DAH postulates two key themes. Its first part postulates that death should not be considered the end of existence and the second part emphasizes that the belief in immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.

==Beginning==

The theory was first promoted in the book ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses'' in 2007. A second book with its elaboration, ''Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated'', was published in 2008. Both books were authored by Hossain. Later the journal ''[[Death Studies]]'' and [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] reviewed these publications for the readerships in Scientific Thanatology and Spiritual Psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, P. (2009). Human Adjustment and the Problem of Death. Death Studies, 33 (8), 771–774&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siddique, M. Z. (2009)Reviewing the Phenomenon of Death—A Scientific Effort from the Islamic World. Death Studies, 33 (2), 190–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenwick, P. (2009). Book Reviewing by Dr. Peter Fenwick. Newsletter, 27, Spirituality and Special Interest Group. The Royal College of Psychiatrists. London. at http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/college/specialinterestgroups/spirituality/publications/newsletter27.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  After the analyses of the reviewers were published, the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] at London published the theory itself as the short article ''Facing the Finality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''&lt;ref&gt;http://rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] publication ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'' did the same in its article "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain. "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses". ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'', vol. 15, no. 4 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hossain was intolerant to death himself. His childhood was terrified with the anticipatory thoughts of his parents' death. When his elder son Mohammad Seeyam Samir died, parallel to developing support for himself, Hossain decided to put forward his resolutions for death anxiety and grief through the scientific readerships. His research works during and after that period gave birth to the articles and books that he later published promoting the theory and for sufferers of intense death anxiety. Hossain's works on the theory further flourished as his parents' terminal illnesses appeared and compelled him to adjust himself comprehensively to the phenomenon of death for a peaceful personal life. He admitted in one of his autobiographical articles that without the turmoils in his own life he could never realize about the disasters and work to prevent them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, MS, 2011, Abstinence: A Memoir, Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16:5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key components==

Factors behind the DAH are described in ''European Psychiatry'', Volume 26, Supplement 1, Page 1727 in the following manner –

"Viewed from a naturalistic and scientific perspective, death appears to represent the permanent cessation of human existence, contributing to the widespread experience of death anxiety. The present argument attempts to deconstruct this argument on epistemological grounds by analyzing
1) the prevailing universal concept of death in naturalistic discourse, &lt;br/&gt;
2) the issue of our adjustment to this presumed reality, and &lt;br/&gt;
3) the relationship between existence and death in the context of their social evolution. &lt;br/&gt;
Integrating this conceptual analysis with empirical observations, the paper then explores the contrasting postulate, namely that death may not be the end of our existence, and the moral
implications of this alternative assumption. This position, termed the "death adjustment hypotheses," would seem to offer an alternative grounding for theory and research in Thanatology."

===Concept of death===

Finding a common platform regarding the concept of death was the first step towards this work. Dr Hossain's finding was that without a common idea about death people will not be able to share the same remedy for death anxiety.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. ''Illness, Crisis and Loss'', Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt; There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hossain's claim that whenever death is taken as permanent and absolute cessation of human existence, morbid fear of death begins; therefore DAH he presented with different ideas of death in relation to existence to reach a conclusion that will be acceptable to most.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"&gt;Hossain, M S. 2007. Quest for a new death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death anxiety as a whole===

Death anxiety is the central concern of DAH. It is the morbid, abnormal or persistent fear of one's own death or the process of his/her dying. One definition of death anxiety is a "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to ‘be’".&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: {{cite journal|url=http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |title=How death anxiety impacts nurses' caring for patients at the end of life: a review of literature |vauthors=Peters L, Cant R, Payne S, O'Connor M, McDermott F, Hood K, Morphet J, Shimoinaba K |journal=Open Nurs J. |year=2013 |volume=7 |pages=14–21 |doi=10.2174/1874434601307010014 |pmid=23400515 |pmc=3565229 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172346/http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), and is distinguished from  [[necrophobia]], which is a specific fear of  dead or dying persons and/or things (i.e. others who are dead or dying, not one's own death or dying).&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt; DAH proposes that no one is free from this anxiety unless there is something significantly positive in the phenomenon of death for humans. Hossain claimed, the idea of 'cessation of existence' through death is the prime factor responsible for initiating death anxiety in one.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S.2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existential death anxiety===

It is apparent that Hossain's description of death anxiety in DAH actually overlaps the idea of existential death anxiety, which is the basic knowledge and awareness that life must end. However, DAH indicates 'existence' as the primary humane need and 'pleasure' as the secondary one. Therefore, DAH postulates, though existential death anxiety strongly correlates behavioral changes,&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; pleasure in existence must be ensured to maintain the balance between life and death peacefully. Hossain, in the iteration of DAH, highlighted how this sort of death anxiety evolved in the society through time based on his analysis of the history of the West starting from 5th century up to 20th century. DAH adds that assurance of pleasure or pain-free status in any existence after death is another key factor in adjusting with the phenomenon of death even if one is not overwhelmed by existential death anxiety due to his/her belief in any sort of existence after death.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S. 2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing. Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialism, immorality and judgment issues===
Hossain explained, as existence after death creates the scope for being judged and punished for the immoral deeds in life, most self-claimed believers pass through the denial of afterlife for their immorality in search of limitless materialistic pleasure. Therefore, one of the key propositions of DAH was the fact that mostly humans abandon their moral ethics due to heightened materialism that gives birth to existential death anxiety even among the self-claimed believers in the existence after death.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MeyersGoldenPeterson&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, Fred Peterson. Infobase Publishing, 2009, 106 page. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Mohammad+Samir+Hossain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declarations of the Death and adjustment hypotheses==

As outlined very briefly in journal articles, DAH hypothesizes the following for optimum attitude towards death as well as to harmonize the adjustment problems in relation to the phenomenon:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – One: In the absence of empirical evidence from science, to regard death to be not our absolute end seems natural and is an epistemologically sound point of view. Therefore, it is also more useful practically and for our adjustment to the phenomenon.
*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – Two: Changing our materialistic view to a moral one on life can help eradicate the social denial of death through the establishment of a sound concept of the phenomenon at personal and societal level, which should also potentate our adjustment to the phenomenon.

==Types==
[[Robert Langs]] distinguishes three types of death anxiety:&lt;ref name=escp&gt;http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predatory death anxiety ===
Predatory death anxiety arises from the fear of being harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Langs, R. Three Forms of Death Anxiety. Retrieved from http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most basic and oldest&lt;ref&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p615&lt;/ref&gt; form of death anxiety, with its origins in the first [[unicellular organism]]s’ set of adaptive resources. Unicellular organisms have receptors that have evolved to react to external dangers, along with self-protective, responsive mechanisms made to increase the likelihood of survival in the face of chemical and physical forms of attack or danger.&lt;ref&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p616&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, predatory death anxiety is evoked by a variety of danger situations that put one at risk or threaten one's survival.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p617&lt;/ref&gt; These traumas may be physical, psychological, or both.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"/&gt; Predatory death anxiety mobilizes an individual's adaptive resources and leads to a [[fight-or-flight response]]: active efforts to combat the danger or attempts to escape the threatening situation.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"/&gt;

=== Predation or predator death anxiety ===
Predation or predator death anxiety is a form that arises when an individual harms another, physically and/or mentally. This form of death anxiety is often accompanied by unconscious guilt.&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; This guilt, in turn, motivates and encourages a variety of self-made decisions and actions by the perpetrator of harm to others.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald.Hilgendorf. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3950021 Death imagery and death anxiety.] Journal of Clinical Psychology. 1996. p88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential death anxiety ===
Existential death anxiety stems from the basic knowledge that human life must end. Existential death anxiety is known to be the most powerful form.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p10&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that language has created the basis for existential death anxiety through communicative and behavioral changes.&lt;ref name="langs"/&gt; Other factors include an awareness of the distinction between self and others, a full sense of personal identity, and the ability to anticipate the future.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p11&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Awareness of human mortality arose some 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p13&lt;/ref&gt; In that extremely short span of evolutionary time, humans have fashioned a single basic mechanism through which they deal with the existential death anxieties this awareness has evoked—denial.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"/&gt; Denial is effected through a wide range of mental mechanisms and physical actions, many of which go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; While denial can be adaptive in limited use, excessive use is more common and is emotionally costly.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; Denial is the root of such diverse actions as breaking rules, violating frames and boundaries, manic celebrations, directing violence against others, attempting to gain extraordinary wealth and power—and more.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p14&lt;/ref&gt; These pursuits are often activated by a death-related trauma, and while they may lead to constructive actions, more often than not, they lead to actions that are damaging to self and others.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"/&gt;

== Theories==

===Thanatophobia===

[[Sigmund Freud]] hypothesized that people express a fear of death, called thanatophobia. He said he saw this as a disguise for a deeper source of concern. It was not actually death that people feared, because in Freud's view nobody believes in their own death. The unconscious does not deal with the passage of time or with negations, which does not calculate amount of time left in one's life. Furthermore, that which one does fear cannot be death itself, because one has never died. People who express death-related fears, actually are trying to deal with unresolved childhood conflicts that they cannot come to terms with or express emotion towards.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald&gt;http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106|title=The Truth about Death and Dying|first1=Karen|last1=Meyers|first2=Robert N.|last2=Golden|first3=Fred|last3=Peterson|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781438125817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Thanatophobia is made from the Greek figure of death known as [[Thanatos]].

===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair===

Developmental psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] formulated the psychosocial theory that explained that people progress through a series of crises as they grow older. The theory also envelops the concept that once an individual reaches the latest stages of life, they reach the level he titled as "[[ego integrity]]". Ego Integrity is when one comes to terms with their life and accepts it. It was also suggested that when a person reaches the stage of late adulthood they become involved in a thorough overview of their life to date. When one can find meaning or purpose in their life, they have reached the integrity stage. In opposition, when an individual views their life as a series of failed and missed opportunities, then they do not reach the ego integrity stage. Elders that have attained this stage of ego integrity are believed to exhibit less of an influence from death anxiety.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Terror management theory===
{{main|Terror management theory}}
[[Ernest Becker]] based this theory on existential views which turned death anxiety theories towards a new dimension. It said that death anxiety is not only real, but also it is people's most profound source of concern. He explained the anxiety as so intense that it can generate fears and phobias of everyday life—Fears of being alone or in a confined space. Based on the theory, many of people's daily behavior consist of attempts to deny death and to keep their anxiety under strict regulation.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal97tm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As an individual develops [[mortality salience]], i.e. becomes more aware of the inevitability of death, they will instinctively try to suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions.&lt;ref&gt;Castano, Emanuele. (2011). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00822.x/abstract Ideology, Fear of Death, and Death Anxiety] 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and adjustment hypotheses===
{{main|Death and adjustment hypotheses}}
[[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] postulated the [[Death and adjustment hypotheses]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} With the declaration of the hypotheses, two things were postulated. The first part of the hypotheses theorizes that death should not be considered the end of existence. The next segment states the belief that the immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Being, time and Dasein===

[[Martin Heidegger]], the German philosopher, on the one hand showed death as something conclusively determined, in the sense that it is inevitable for every human being, while on the other hand, it unmasks its indeterminate nature via the truth that one never knows when or how death is going to come. Heidegger does not engage in speculation about whether being after death is possible. He argues that all human existence is embedded in time: past, present, future, and when considering the future, we encounter the notion of death. This then creates angst. Angst can create a clear understanding in one that death is a possible mode of existence, which Heidegger described as “clearing”. Thus, angst can lead to a freedom about existence, but only if we can stop denying our mortality (as expressed in Heidegger's terminology as “stop denying being-for-death”).&lt;ref name=concepts&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. Illness, Crisis and Loss, Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning management theory===

[[Paul T. P. Wong]]'s work on the meaning management theory&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2008). Meaning-management theory and death acceptance. In A. Tomer, G. T. Eliason, &amp; P. T. P. Wong (Eds.), ''Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes'' (pp. 65-87). New York, NY: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that human reactions to death are complex, multifaceted and dynamic.&lt;ref name=concepts/&gt; His “Death Attitude Profile” identifies three types of death acceptances as Neutral, Approach, and Escape acceptances.&lt;ref&gt;Gesser, G., Wong, P. T. P., &amp; Reker, G. T. (1987-88). Death attitudes across the life span. The development and validation of the Death Attitude Profile (DAP). ''Omega, 2'', 113-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P., Reker, G. T., &amp; Gesser, G. (1994). Death Attitude Profile – Revised: A multidimensional measure of attitudes toward death (DAP-R). In R. A. Neimeyer (Ed.), ''Death anxiety handbook: Research, instrumentation, and application'' (pp. 121-148). Washington, DC: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from acceptances, his work also represents different aspects of the meaning of death fear that are rooted in the bases of death anxiety. The ten meanings he proposes are finality, uncertainty, annihilation, ultimate loss, life flow disruption, leaving the loved ones, pain and loneliness, prematurity and violence of death, failure of life work completion, judgment and retribution centered.

===Other theories===

Other theories on death anxiety were introduced in the late part of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p570"&gt;Langs." Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety" The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p570&lt;/ref&gt; The existential approach, with theorists such as [[Rollo May]] and [[Viktor Frankl]], views an individual's personality as being governed by the continuous choices and decisions in relation to the realities of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L. "Psychology" 2011. Chapter 12, page 488.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is the ''regret theory'' which was introduced by Adrian Tomer and Grafton Eliason.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"&gt;Langs. [http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/prev.90.4.565.23914?journalCode=prev Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety.] The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p575&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the theory is to target the way people evaluate the quality and/or worth of their lives.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt; The possibility of death usually makes people more anxious if they feel that they have not and cannot accomplish any positive task in the life that they are living.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;  Research has tried to unveil the factors that might influence the amount of anxiety people experience in life.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;

===Personal meanings of death===
{{See also|Meaning-making}}
Humans develop meanings and associate them with objects and events in their environment, provoking certain emotions within an individual. People tend to develop personal meanings of death which could accordingly be negative or positive for the individual. If they are positive, then the consequences of those meanings can be comforting (for example, ideas of a rippling effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yalom |first=Irvin D. |authorlink=Irvin D. Yalom |date=2008 |chapter=Rippling |title=Staring at the sun: overcoming the terror of death |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |isbn=9780787996680 |oclc=155715164 |pages=83–92 |quote=Each of us creates—often without our conscious intent or knowledge—concentric circles of influence that may affect others for years, even generations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; left on those still alive). If negative they can cause emotional turmoil. Depending on the certain meaning one has associated with death, the consequences will vary accordingly whether they are negative or positive meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cicirelli |first=Victor G. |date=November 1998 |title=Personal meanings of death in relation to fear of death |journal=[[Death Studies]] |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=713–733 |doi=10.1080/074811898201236 |pmid=10346699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religiosity's effect===

The thought of death causes a different degree of anxiety for different individuals, depending on many factors.

A 2012 study involving Christian and Muslim college students from the US, Turkey, and Malaysia found that their religiosity was positively correlated with an increased fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = L. | last2 = Wahab | first2 = E. A. | last3 = Ratnasingan | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1080/13674676.2011.652606 | title = Religiosity and fear of death: A three‐nation comparison | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 179 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found a strong sense of religion in a person's life can be related to a lower sense of anxiety towards death.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Wen, Y. (2010). Religiosity and death anxiety. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning, 6(2), 31-37. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/867401301&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been no association discovered between religiosity and death anxiety,&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; it has also been shown that death anxiety tends to be lower in individuals who regularly attend religious meetings or gatherings.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; On a recent study, one hundred and sixty-five church participants have been asked to fill out the "Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale, the Revised Death Anxiety Scale" and the results were analyzed using factor analyses, Pearson correlation, and linear and quadratic regression. All found an inverse relationship between intrinsic religious motivation and death anxiety. In short, the more religious you are, the less anxious you are about death because you may associate death with another beginning that is promised through many religions.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; The study also found that gender did not have an effect on religiosity and total death anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, Ya-Hui. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning6. 2 (Dec 2010): 31-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

The earliest documentation of the fear of death has been found in children as young as age 5.&lt;ref name="maya"&gt;Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. The Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 12 (4), 525-535. Retrieved from http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/13591045/v12i0004/525_duafodiyc&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological measures and reaction times were used to measure fear of death in young children. Recent studies that assess fear of death in children use questionnaire rating scales.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt; There are many tests to study this including The Death Anxiety Scale for Children (DASC) developed by Schell and Seefeldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slaughter|first=Virginia|author2=Griffiths|title=Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=October 2007|volume=12 | issue = 4|pages=525–535|doi=10.1177/1359104507080980|pmid=18095535}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the most common version of this test is the revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children (FSSC-R).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The FSSC-R describes specific fearful stimuli and children are asked to rate the degree to which the scenario/item makes them anxious or fearful.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The most recent version of the FSSC-R presents the scenarios in a pictorial form to children as young as 4. It is called the Koala Fear Questionnaire (KFQ).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The fear studies show that children's fears can be grouped into five categories. One of these categories is death and danger.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  This response was found amongst children age 4 to 6 on the KFQ, and from age 7 to 10.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  Death is the most commonly feared item and remains the most commonly feared item throughout adolescence.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;

A study of 90 children, aged 4–8, done by Virginia Slaughter and Maya Griffiths showed that a more mature understanding of the biological concept of death was correlated to a decreased fear of death. This may suggest that it is helpful to teach children about death (in a biological sense), in order to alleviate the fear.&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter, V., Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry. 12 (4) pg 525-535&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship between adult attachment and death anxiety ==
There has been much literature that supports the existence of a correlation between one's state of coping skills, mental health, emotions and cognitive reactions to stressful events, and one's ability to regulate affect concerning one's death anxiety. A series of tests determined that significantly high levels of death anxiety tend to occur in close relationships with an intimate partner (more so amongst females than males).&lt;ref&gt;Beggs, J. R.The relationship between adult attachment style and death anxiety as related to a romantic partner. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 5231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexes ==
The connection between death anxiety and one's sex appears to be strong.  Studies show that females tend to have more death anxiety than males.  Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60.  The Death Anxiety Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men.  Moreover, researchers believe that age and culture could be major influences in why women score higher on death anxiety scales than men.&lt;ref name="Harrawood, L. K. 2008"&gt;Harrawood, L. K., White, L. J., &amp; Benshoff, J. J. (2008). Death Anxiety in a National Sample of United States Funeral Directors and Its Relationship with Death Exposure, Age, and Sex. Omega: Journal of Death &amp; Dying, 58(2), 129-146. {{DOI|10.2190/OM.58.2.c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the evolutionary period, a basic method was created to deal with death anxiety and also as a means of dealing with loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew.Dawson."Death anexiety:State or Trait" Journal od Clinical Psychology.1979.pg158&lt;/ref&gt; Denial is used when memories or feelings are too painful to accept and are often rejected.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"&gt;Donald.Charles. "Death Anxiety and Mental Ability" Essence: Issues in the Study of Ageing, Dying and Death. 1979.p85&lt;/ref&gt; By maintaining that the event never happened, rather than accepting it, allows an individual more time to work through the inevitable pain.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; When a loved one dies in a family, denial is often implemented as a means to come to grips with the reality that the person is gone.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Closer families often deal with death better than when coping individually.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; As society and families drift apart so does the time spent bereaving those who have died, which in turn leads to negative emotion and negativity towards death.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Women, who are the child bearers and are often the ones who look after children hold greater concerns about death due to their caring role within the family.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"&gt;Langs. "Death Anxiety and the Emotion-processing Mind" Psychoanalytic Psychology .2004.p43&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this common role of women that leads to greater death anxiety as it emphasize the ‘importance to live’ for her offspring.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt; Although it is common knowledge that all living creatures die, many people do not accept their own mortality, preferring not to accept that death is inevitable, and that they will one day die.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt;

==Age ==
It is during the years of young adulthood (20 to 40 years of age) that death anxiety most often begins to become prevalent.  However, during the next phase of life, the middle age adult years (40–64 years of age), death anxiety peaks at its highest levels when in comparison to all other age ranges throughout the lifespan.  Surprisingly, levels of death anxiety then slump off in the old age years of adulthood (65 years of age and older).  This is in contrast with most people's expectations, especially regarding all of the negative connotations younger adults have about the elderly and the aging process (Kurlychek &amp; Trenner, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trenner|title=Accuracy of perception and attitude: An intergenerational investigation|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skill|year=1982|volume=54|issue=1|pages=271–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring death anxiety ==

There are many ways to measure death anxiety and fear.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"&gt;Tomer.Eliason."Toward a comprehensive model of death anxiety" Death Stuides.1996.p353&lt;/ref&gt; Katenbaum and Aeinsberg (1972) devised three propositions for this measurement.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; From this start, the ideologies about death anxiety have been able to be recorded and their attributes listed.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; Methods such as imagery tasks to simple questionnaires and apperception tests such as the [[Stroop effect#Stroop test|Stroop test]] enable psychologists to adequately determine if a person is under stress due to death anxiety or suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;
The Lester attitude death scale was developed in 1966 but not published until 1991 until its validity was proven.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; By measuring the general attitude towards death and also the inconsistencies with death attitudes, participants are scaled to their favorable value towards death.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;

[[File:White-Rabbit-making-elixir-of-immortality.jpg|thumb|The mythological [[Moon rabbit|White Hare]] making the elixir of life on the Moon, from Chinese mythology.]]
The '''elixir of life''', also known as  '''elixir of immortality''' and sometimes equated with the [[philosopher's stone]], is a [[potion]] that supposedly grants the drinker [[Immortality|eternal life]] and/or [[eternal youth]]. This [[elixir]] was also said to cure all diseases. [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir.

== History ==

=== China ===
[[File:Xu Fu expedition's for the elixir of life.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Xu Fu]]'s first expedition to the [[Mount Penglai|Mount of the immortals]]. By [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]
In ancient China, various [[emperor]]s sought the fabled elixir with varying results. In the [[Qin Dynasty]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] sent [[Taoist]] alchemist [[Xu Fu]] with 500 young men and 500 young women to the eastern seas to find the elixir, but he never came back (legend has it that he found [[Japan]] instead). When Shi Huang Di visited, he brought 3000 young girls and boys, but none of them ever returned.

The ancient Chinese believed that ingesting long-lasting precious substances such as [[jade]], [[cinnabar]] or [[hematite]] would confer some of that longevity on the person who consumed them.  [[Gold]] was considered particularly potent, as it was a non-tarnishing precious metal; the idea of potable or drinkable gold is found in China by the end of the third century BC.  The most famous Chinese alchemical book, the Danjing yaojue (Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics) attributed to [[Sun Simiao]] (c. 581 – c. 682 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Science, Technology And Medicine: An Encyclopedia, A Glick, T.F., A Livesey, S.J., Wallis, F., Routledge, p. 20 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/582108/Tan-chin-yao-chueh|title=Tan chin yao chueh – occultism|work=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a famous medical specialist respectfully called "King of Medicine" by later generations, discusses in detail the creation of elixirs for immortality (mercury, sulfur, and the salts of mercury and arsenic are prominent, and most are poisonous) as well as those for curing certain diseases and the fabrication of precious stones.

Many of these substances, far from contributing to longevity, were actively toxic and resulted in [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning]]. The [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming Dynasty]] died from ingesting a lethal dosage of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the supposed "Elixir of Life" conjured by alchemists. British historian [[Joseph Needham]] compiled a list of Chinese emperors whose deaths were likely due to elixir poisoning{{cn|date=November 2015}}.

=== India ===
[[Amrita]], the elixir of life has been described in the Hindu scriptures (not to be confused with Amrit related to Sikh religion (see [[Amrit Sanskar]])). Anybody who consumes even a tiniest portion of Amrit has been described to gain immortality. Legend has it that at early times when the inception of the world had just taken place, evil demons (Ashur) had gained strength. This was seen as a threat to the gods (Devas) who feared them. So these gods (including [[Indra]], the god of sky, Vayu, the god of wind, and [[Agni]], the god of fire) went to seek advice and help from the three primary gods according to the Hindus: [[Vishnu]] (the preserver), [[Brahma]] (the creator), and [[Shiva]] (the destroyer). They suggested that Amrit could only be gained from the [[samudra manthan]] (or churning of the ocean) for the ocean in its depths hid mysterious and secret objects. Vishnu agreed to take the form of a turtle on whose shell a huge mountain was placed. This mountain was used as a churning pole.

With the help of a [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (mighty and long serpent, king of Nagloka) the churning process began at the surface. From one side the gods pulled the serpent, which had coiled itself around the mountain, and the demons pulled it from the other side. As the churning process required immense strength, hence the demons were persuaded to do the job—they agreed in return for a portion of Amrit. Finally with their combined efforts (of the gods and demons), Amrit emerged from the ocean depths. All the gods were offered the drink but the gods managed to trick the demons who did not get the holy drink.

The oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life. Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century BC [[Arthashastra]], about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West. Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.

It is also possible that the alchemy of medicine and immortality came to China from India, or vice versa; in any case, for both cultures, gold-making appears to have been a minor concern, and medicine the major concern. But the elixir of immortality was of little importance in India (which had other avenues to immortality). The Indian elixirs were mineral remedies for specific diseases or, at the most, to promote long life.

=== Europe ===
{{Main|Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Dell' elixir vitae 1624 Donato d'Eremita Plate 1 AQ14 (1).jpg|thumb|''Dell' elixir vitae'', 1624]]
In European [[alchemical]] tradition, the Elixir of Life is closely related to the creation of the philosopher's stone. According to legend, certain alchemists have gained a reputation as creators of the elixir. These include [[Nicolas Flamel]] and [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].

== Names ==
The Elixir has had hundreds of names (one scholar of Chinese history reportedly found over 1,000 names for it), among them Amrit Ras or [[Amrita]], Aab-i-Hayat, Maha Ras, Aab-Haiwan, Dancing Water, Chasma-i-Kausar, Mansarover or the Pool of Nectar, [[Philosopher's stone]], and Soma Ras.  The word ''[[wikt:elixir|elixir]]'' was not used until the 7th century A.D. and derives from the Arabic name for miracle substances, "al iksir".  Some view it as a metaphor for the spirit of God (''e.g.'', Jesus's reference to "the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]" or "the [[Fountain of Life]]").  "But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.  Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."  (John 4:14)  The [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]] adopted the name for their "liquid gold": the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for [[whiskey]] is [[uisce beatha]], or water of life.

''Aab-i-Hayat'' is Persian and means "water of life".&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Poonawala. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-ii-water-in-muslim-iranian-culture "ĀB ii. Water in Muslim Iranian culture"].  ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''. Retrieved 12 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Chashma-i-Kausar" (not "hasma") is the "Fountain of Bounty", which Muslims believe to be located in Paradise.  As for the Indian names, "Amrit Ras" means "immortality juice", "Maha Ras" means "great juice", and "Soma Ras" means "juice of Soma".  Soma was a psychoactive drug, by which the poets of the [[Vedas]] received their visions, but the plant is no longer known.  Later, Soma came to mean the moon.  "Ras" later came to mean "sacred mood experienced listening to poetry or music"; there are altogether nine of them.  [[Mansarovar]], the "mind lake" is  the  holy  lake at the foot  of [[Mt. Kailash]] in Tibet, close to the source of the Ganges.

== In popular culture ==
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}

The elixir of life has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of artistic works including [[animation]], [[comics]], [[film|films]], musical compositions, [[novel|novels]], and [[video games]]. Examples include [[L. Frank Baum|L. Frank Baum's]] fantasy novel ''[[John Dough and the Cherub]]'', the science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[House of Anubis]]'', the popular manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', the light novel ''[[Baccano!]]'', and the movie [[Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva]] of the popular [[Professor Layton]] franchise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9918">'''Induction of final maturation''' of [[oocyte]]s is a procedure that is usually performed as part of [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation]] to render the oocytes fully developed and thereby resulting in optimal [[pregnancy chance]]s. It is basically a replacement for the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surge whose effects include final maturation in natural [[menstrual cycle]]s.

The main medications used for induction of final maturation are [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) and [[GnRH agonist]]. In fresh (rather than [[oocyte cryopreservation|frozen]]) [[autotransplantation|autologous]] cycles of [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]], final oocyte maturation triggering with GnRH agonist instead of hCG decreases the risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] but decreases [[live birth rate]]. In cycles followed by [[oocyte donation]], use of GnRH agonists instead of hCG decreases the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with no evidence of a difference in live birth rate.&lt;ref name="YoussefVan der Veen2014"/&gt;

==Usage with ovulation==
Induction of final maturation also initiates the mechanisms that eventually result in [[ovulation]], and thereby makes the oocytes destined to undergo ovulation unless artificial [[oocyte retrieval]] is performed first. Therefore, induction of final maturation is also called '''triggering oocyte release''' from the ovary, and the administration of [[pharmaceutical drug]]s to induce final maturation is colloquially called giving a "trigger shot", even if the plan is to perform artificial oocyte retrieval before ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infertility.about.com/od/infertilitytreatments/ss/ivf_treatment_5.htm About.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Administration of a drug to trigger oocyte release without oocyte retrieval results in a predictable time of ovulation, with the interval from drug administration to ovulation depending on the type of drug. This avails for [[sexual intercourse]] or [[intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) to conviently be scheduled at ovulation, the most likely time to achieve pregnancy.&lt;ref name=ivf.com&gt;[http://www.ivf.com/ovind.html IVF.com &gt; Ovulation Induction] Retrieved on Mars 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In cycles stimulated with [[clomifene]] for intended conception by sexual intercourse, however, triggering oocyte release has been shown to decrease pregnancy chances compared to frequent monitoring with [[LH surge]] tests.&lt;ref name=Committee2013&gt;{{cite journal |title=Use of clomiphene citrate in infertile women: a committee opinion |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=341–8 |date=August 2013  |pmid=23809505 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.05.033 |url=|author1=Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in such cases, triggering oocyte release is best reserved for women who require IUI and in whom LH monitoring proves difficult or unreliable.&lt;ref name=Committee2013/&gt; It may also be used when LH monitoring hasn't shown an LH surge by cycle day 18 (where cycle day 1 is the first day of the preseding menstruation) and there is an [[ovarian follicle]] of over 20&amp;nbsp;mm in size.&lt;ref name=McWilliams&gt;[http://www.houstonfertilityspecialist.com/clomid.html Clomiphene Citrate, Clomid] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140510150039/http://www.houstonfertilityspecialist.com/clomid.html |date=2014-05-10 }}. By Robert B. McWilliams. The Center for Reproduction and Women's Health Care, Houston, Texas. Retrieved May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage with artificial oocyte retrieval==
In [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] (IVF), induction of final maturation avails for [[egg retrieval]] when the eggs are fully mature.

In IVF, final maturation induction is preceded by [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation]]. It is suggested that there should be a size of [[ovarian follicle]]s of at least 15&amp;nbsp;mm, and serum estradiol level of 0.49 nmol/L before commencing final maturation induction. There are better prospects at a follicle size of 18&amp;nbsp;mm and serum estradiol level of 0.91 nmol/L.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiopaedia.org/articles/follicular-monitoring Follicular monitoring] from [[Radiopaedia]]. By Dr Praveen Jha et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medications==
Medications used for final maturation and/or release of oocytes include:
*[[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] (HCG or hCG) in a low dose, which may be injected after completed ovarian stimulation. Ovulation will occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/473515 HCG Injection After Ovulation Induction With Clomiphene Citrate] at Medscape. By Peter Kovacs. Posted: 04/23/2004&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]], where it makes the follicles perform their final maturation. A [[transvaginal oocyte retrieval]] is then performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. HCG injection confers a risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]]. 
*[[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] [[luteinizing hormone]] (rLH), recombinant HCG (rHCG) and [[urine]]-derived hCG (uHCG) are equally effective in achieving final follicular maturation in IVF with regards to pregnancy rates and risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.&lt;ref name="Farquhar2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Rishworth|first2=Josephine R|last3=Brown|first3=Julie|last4=Nelen|first4=Willianne LDM|last5=Marjoribanks|first5=Jane|last6=|first6=|year=2015|title=Assisted reproductive technology: an overview of Cochrane Reviews|url=|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=7|pages=CD010537|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010537.pub4|pmid=26174592|via=|last1=Farquhar|first1=Cindy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30117155|date = November 2018}} Therefore, urine-derived hCG (uHCG) is regarded as the best choice for final oocyte maturation triggering in IVF due to availability and cost.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2013/&gt;
*[[GnRH agonist]], which necessitates using a [[GnRH antagonist]] protocol for [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation#Suppression of spontaneous ovulation|suppression of ovulation during ovarian hyperstimulation]], because using GnRH agonist for that purpose as well inactivates the axis for which it is intended to work for final maturation induction.

===HCG versus GnRH agonist===
Final maturation induction using GnRH agonist results in a substantial decrease in the risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] (OHSS). A [[Cochrane review]] estimated that using GnRH agonist instead of hCG in IVF decreases the risk of mild, moderate or severe OHSS with an [[odds ratio]] of approximately 0.15. The review estimated that, for a woman with a 5% risk of mild, moderate or severe OHSS with the use of HCG, the risk of OHSS with the use of a GnRH agonist would be between 0 and 2%.&lt;ref name="YoussefVan der Veen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Youssef|first1=Mohamed AFM|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last2=Van der Veen|first2=Fulco|last3=Al-Inany|first3=Hesham G|last4=Mochtar|first4=Monique H|last5=Griesinger|first5=Georg|last6=Nagi Mohesen|first6=Mohamed|last7=Aboulfoutouh|first7=Ismail|last8=van Wely|first8=Madelon|last9=Youssef|first9=Mohamed AFM|year=2014|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008046.pub4|title=Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist versus HCG for oocyte triggering in antagonist-assisted reproductive technology|pmid=25358904|issue=10|page=CD008046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, using GnRH agonist has a lower [[live birth rate]] than when using hCG in [[autotransplantation|autologous]] oocyte transfers (rather than ones using [[oocyte donation]]). A Cochrane review of autologous oocyte transfers estimated that GnRH agonist, compared to hCG, gives an [[odds ratio]] of pregnancy of approximately 0.47. It estimated that, for a woman with a 31% chance of achieving live birth with the use of hCG, the chance of a live birth with the use of an GnRH agonist would be between 12% and 24%.&lt;ref name="YoussefVan der Veen2014"/&gt; Likewise, using GnRH agonist instead of hCG was associated with a lower ongoing pregnancy rate (pregnancy beyond 12 weeks) than was seen with HCG (odds ratio 0.70) and a higher rate of early (less than 12 weeks) [[miscarriage]] (odds ratio 1.74). However, a higher pregnancy rate when using hCG is only found in those receiving [[luteal support]] without [[luteinizing hormone]] activity (such as [[progesterone]] or [[progestin]]).&lt;ref name="YoussefVan der Veen2014"/&gt;

Final maturation induction using a GnRH agonist is recommended in women with cancer undergoing [[fertility preservation]], because ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombotic events such as [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]] and peripheral [[arterial embolism]], and this risk can add to an already increased risk caused by the cancer.&lt;ref name="SomiglianaPeccatori2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Somigliana|first1=E.|last2=Peccatori|first2=F.

Using hCG versus GnRH agonist has no effect on the risk of [[multiple pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="YoussefVan der Veen2014"/&gt; Also, no difference has been found between the regimens regarding [[live birth rate]] or ongoing [[pregnancy rate]] when the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation was followed by [[oocyte donation]].&lt;ref name="YoussefVan der Veen2014"/&gt;

== Life ==
Aach was born in [[Oldenburg]]. He gained his doctorate in March 1952 in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the [[University of Göttingen]]. In July 1961 he presented his professorial thesis at the [[University of Cologne]]. He spent several months as visiting faculty at [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]]. On 31 December 1962 he was appointed Extraordinary Professor of Botany at the [[RWTH Aachen University]]. From 12 January 1965 he was appointed to the Chair of Botany in the same place and made director of the Botanical Institute. He retired on 1 March 1984.

The emphasis of his scientific work was on [[protein]]s in [[virus]]es. He collaborated on the ''Handbuch der Biologie''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] (ed.): ''Handbuch der Biologie.'' Akademische Verlags-Gesellschaft Athenaion, Wiesbaden 1942-1977&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cichorium intybus-alvesgaspar1.jpg|thumb|right|The homogamous chicory flower head is made up of bilaterally symmetrical ray florets, each with one long petal.]]
'''Homogamy''' is used in biology in four separate senses: 
*[[Inbreeding]] can be referred to as homogamy.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P.M.B. (ed.) 1988. ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of Science and Technology''. W. R. Chambers Ltd. and Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Homogamy refers to the maturation of male and female reproductive organs at the same time, which is also known as simultaneous or synchronous [[hermaphrodite|hermaphrodism]] and is the antonym of [[dichogamy]]. Many flowers appear to be homogamous but some of these may not be strictly functionally homogamous, because for various reasons male and female reproduction do not completely overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bell, S.A. |author2=Cresswell, J.E. |year=1998|title=The phenology of gender in homogamous flowers: temporal change in the residual sex function of flowers of Oil-seed Rape (Brassica napus)|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=298–306|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00190.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Asteraceae|daisy family]], the flower heads are made up of many small flowers called florets, and are either homogamous or heterogamous. '''Heterogamous heads''' are made up of two types of florets, ray florets near the edge and disk florets in the center. '''Homogamous heads''' are made up of just one type of floret, either all ray florets or all disk florets.
*Homogamy can be used as a form of choosing a mate based on characteristics that are wanted in a sexual partner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sterbová, Z., &amp; Valentová, J. (2012). Influence of homogamy, complementarity, and sexual imprinting on mate choice. ''Anthropologie, 50''(1), 47-59. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://predator.oldwestbury.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1501654564?accountid=29096&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inbreeding ==
As opposed to [[outcrossing]] or outbreeding, [[inbreeding]] is the process by which organisms with common descent come together to mate and eventually procreate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/inbreeding|title=Inbreeding {{!}} genetics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archetype of inbreeding is [[self-pollination]]. When a plant has both anthers and a stigma, the process of inbreeding can occur. Another word for this self-fertilization is [[autogamy]], which is when an anther releases pollen to attach to the stigma on the same plant. Self-pollination is promoted by homogamy. Homogamy is when the anthers and the stigma of a flower are being matured at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/crop_improvement/crop_imprv_pollmode.html|title=TNAU Agritech Portal Crop Imporvement:: Mode of Pollination|last=|first=|date=|website=Agritech.tnau.ac.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of self-pollination guides the plant to [[homozygosity]], causing a specific gene to be received from each of the parents leading to the possession of two exact formats of that gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12730|title=Definition of Homozygosity|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assortative mating ==
[[Assortative mating]] is the choosing of a mate to breed with based on their physical characteristics, [[phenotypical]] traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/assortative-mating|title=Assortative mating {{!}} genetics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are social factors that enhance one's choosing, such as religion, physical traits, and culture. For instance, research has been conducted by sociologists who found that men and women look for individuals who fall under the educational homogamy he or she is in. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raniagihleb.com/resources/RESOURCES/marriage3k.pdf |title=Educational Homogamy and Assortative Mating Have Not Increased |last1=Gihleb |first1=Rania |last2=Lang |first2=Kevin |date= |website=raniagihleb.com |series=NBER Working Paper W22927 |access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homogamy theory holds that when organisms look for a potential partner, they search for organisms that have similar traits to themselves. The idea of sexual imprinting plays a role in this theory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Based on whether or not an individual is a male or a female, the individual tends to be attracted to other people that have most similar characteristics to their parent of the opposite gender. This is a form of [[Assortative mating|positive assortative mating]], where people choose a mate with attributes that correlate with their own. According to Kalmijn and Flap, there are five places individuals could become acquainted with each other in. These five places are: work, school, neighborhood, common family networks, and voluntary associations. They also studied the five criteria that are usually looked for to decide on the status of wanting to mate. As such, the five traits are: age, education, class destinations, class origins, and religious background.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Evolutionary aspect ==
&lt;p&gt;There is a evolutionary theory that explain that there are two specific qualities that are looked out. These two traits are male dominance and the attractiveness of the female. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Todd_Lucas/publication/239799863_Marital_satisfaction_in_four_cultures_as_a_function_of_homogamy_male_dominance_and_female_attractiveness/links/5547a7830cf2b0cf7ace7216.pdf|format=PDF|title=Marital satisfaction in four cultures as a function of homogamy, male dominance and female attractiveness|website=Researchgate.net|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the evolutionary perspective, the purpose of mating is to procreate for the purpose of survival. It is the ones with the best features and traits that survive, a known phrase called [[survival of the fittest]]. If there was a couple who lacked the ability to become fertile or have a child with a disease or a handicap, there is a great rise in the risk of the couple receiving  a divorce. &lt;ref&gt;Littlefield, C.H. and Silverman, I. (1991) ‘Marital dissatisfaction following the death of a child: the influence of genetic factors at cause in the death’, Journal of Marriage and the Family 53: 799–804.&lt;/ref&gt; When there are traits that are found in a spouse that are not favorable, then the homogamy in the relationship decreases, and there begins to have a need for it for a better production of children.

'''iFood''' ('''''isotopic'' food''') contains nutritients in which some atoms are replaced with their heavier non-radioactive [[isotope]]s (such as  [[deuterium|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H]] or [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]]).

==Mechanism of protective effect==
One of the most pernicious and irreparable types of [[oxidative damage]] inflicted by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) upon biomolecules involves the carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage (hydrogen abstraction). Intriguingly, the biomolecules most damageable by this type of damage belong to the group of [[essential nutrient]]s (10 out of 20 amino acids; nucleosides at certain conditions (conditionally essential); all [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s). In theory, replacing hydrogen with deuterium "reinforces" the bond due to the [[kinetic isotope effect]], and such reinforced biomolecules taken up by the body will be more resistant to ROS.&lt;ref name=pmid17378752&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/rej.2006.0506 |pmid=17378752 |title=Reactive Oxygen Species, Isotope Effect, Essential Nutrients, and Enhanced Longevity |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=47–59 |year=2007 |last1=Shchepinov |first1=Mikhail S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deuterated omega-6 fatty acids for humans with degenerative diseases==
The company Retrotope pioneered the [[drug development|development]] a source of deuterated [[omega-6]] fatty acid 11,11-D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ethyl linoleate (RT001) as a food additive for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Friedreich’s ataxia]] and [[infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy]]. [[FDA]] has granted it an orphan drug designation and it passed the Phase I/II [[clinical trial]]s (as of 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt0617-493 |pmid=28591114 |title=First deuterated drug approved |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=493–494 |year=2017 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Charles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different from treatment with heavy water==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11302">'''In vitro spermatogenesis''' is the process of creating male [[gamete]]s ([[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]) outside of the body in a culture system. The process could be useful for fertility preservation, infertility treatment and may further develop the understanding of [[spermatogenesis]] at the cellular and molecular level.  

Spermatogenesis is a highly complex process and artificially rebuilding it ''[[in vitro]]'' is challenging.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} These include creating a similar microenvironment to that of the testis as well as supporting endocrine and paracrine signalling, and ensuring survival of the somatic and germ cells from [[spermatogonial stem cell]]s (SSCs) to mature spermatozoa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Karin|last2=Schlatt|first2=Stefan|last3=Ehmcke|first3=Jens|last4=Wistuba|first4=Joachim|date=2012-10-01|title=Fact or fiction:  In vitro spermatogenesis|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=4|pages=245–252|doi=10.4161/spmg.21983|issn=2156-5554|pmc=3521746|pmid=23248765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different methods of culturing can be used in the process such as isolated [[cell culture]]s, fragment cultures and [[3D cell culture|3D cultures]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Culture techniques ==
=== Isolated cell cultures ===
Cell cultures can include either monocultures, where one cell population is cultured, or co-culturing systems, where several cells lines (must be at least two) can be cultured together.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galdon|first=Guillermo|last2=Atala|first2=Anthony|last3=Sadri-Ardekani|first3=Hooman|date=2016-04-23|title=In Vitro Spermatogenesis: How Far from Clinical Application?|journal=Current Urology Reports|language=en|volume=17|issue=7|pages=49|doi=10.1007/s11934-016-0605-3|pmid=27107595|issn=1527-2737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells are initially isolated for culture by enzymatically digesting the testis tissue to separate out the different cells types for culture.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The process of isolating cells can lead to cell damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Damien|last2=Anand-Ivell|first2=Ravinder|last3=Danner|first3=Sandra|last4=Ivell|first4=Richard|date=2012-01-01|title=Models of in vitro spermatogenesis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341244/|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=1|pages=32–43|doi=10.4161/spmg.19383|issn=2156-5554|pmc=3341244|pmid=22553488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of monoculture is that the effect of different influences on one specific cell population of cells can be investigated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Co-culture allows for the interactions between cell populations to be observed and experimented on, which is seen as an advantage over the monoculture model.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Isolated cell culture, specifically co-culture of testis tissue, has been a useful technique for examining the influences of specific factors such as hormones or different feeder cells on the progression of spermatogenesis ''in vitro''.{{Cit|date=October 2018}} For example, factors such as temperature, feeder cell influence and the role of [[testosterone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) have all been investigated using isolated cell culture techniques.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Studies have concluded that different factors can influence the culture of germ cells e.g. media, growth factors, hormones and temperature. For example, when culturing immortalized mouse germ cells at temperatures of 35, 37 and 29℃, these cells proliferate most rapidly at the highest temperature and least rapidly at the lowest but there were varying levels of differentiation. At the highest temperature no differentiation were detected, some was seen at 37℃ and some early [[spermatid]]s appearing at 32℃.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Investigations of appropriate feeder cells concluded that a variety of cells could encourage development of germ cells such as [[Sertoli cell]]s, [[Leydig cell]]s and [[peritubular myoid cell]]s but the most essential is Sertoli cells, but Leydig and peritubular myoid cells both contribute to the microenvironment that encourage stem cells to remain [[pluripotent]] and self renew in the testis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibtisham|first=Fahar|last2=Wu|first2=Jiang|last3=Xiao|first3=Mei|last4=An|first4=Lilong|last5=Banker|first5=Zachary|last6=Nawab|first6=Aamir|last7=Zhao|first7=Yi|last8=Li|first8=Guanghui|date=2017-09-12|title=Progress and future prospect of in vitro spermatogenesis|journal=Oncotarget|volume=8|issue=39|pages=66709–66727|doi=10.18632/oncotarget.19640|issn=1949-2553|pmc=5630449|pmid=29029549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testes fragment cultures ===
[[File:Testis Organ Culture Vs Cell Culture.jpg|thumb|375x375px|This image shows the difference in process between organ culture and cell culture.]]
In fragment cultures, the testis is removed and fragments of tissue are cultured in supplemental media containing different growth factors to induce spermatogenesis and form functional gametes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The development of this culture technique has taken place mainly with the use of animal models e.g. mice or rat testis tissue.

The advantage of using this method is that it maintains the natural spatial arrangement of the [[seminiferous tubule]]s. However, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] is a recurring problem in these cultures where the low oxygen supply hinders the development and maturation of spermatids (significantly more in adult than immature testis tissues).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other challenges with this type of culture include maintaining the structure of the seminiferous tubules which makes it more difficult for longer-term cell cultures as the tissue structures can flatten out making it hard to work with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To resolve some of these issues, 3D cultures can be used.

In 2012, mature spermatozoa capable of fertilization was isolated from ''in vitro'' culture of immature mouse testis tissue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Hye-Won|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Miles F.|date=2012-10-01|title=In vitro spermatogenesis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3521745/|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=4|pages=238–244|doi=10.4161/spmg.22069|issn=2156-5554|pmc=3521745|pmid=23248764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3D cultures ===
3D cultures use sponge, models or scaffolds that resemble the elements of the [[extracellular matrix]] to achieve a more natural spatial structure of the seminiferous tubules and to better represent the tissues and the interaction between different cell types in an ''[[ex vivo]]'' experiment. Different components of the extracellular matrix such as collagen, agar and calcium alginate are commonly used to form the gel or scaffold which can provide oxygen and nutrients.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To propagate 3D cultures, testicular cell cultures are imbedded into the porous sponge/scaffold and allowed to colonise the structure which can then survive for several weeks to allow [[Spermatogonium|spermatogonia]] to differentiate and mature into spermatozoa.

In addition, shaking 3D cultures during the seeding process allows for an increased oxygen supply which helps overcome the issue of hypoxia and so improves the lifespan of cells.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In contrast to monocultures, fragment/3D cultures are able to establish ''in vitro'' conditions that can somewhat resemble the testicular microenvironment to allow a more accurate study of the testicular physiology and its associations with the ''in vitro'' development of sperm cells.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Future implications ==

=== Scientific ===
The ability to recapitulate spermatogenesis ''In vitro'' provides a unique opportunity to study this biological process through oftentimes cheaper and faster method of research than ''in vivo'' work. Observation is often easier ''in vitro'', as the targeted cells are mostly isolated and immobile. Another significant advantage of ''in vitro'' research is the ease with which environmental factors can be changed and monitored. There are also techniques which are not practical or feasible ''in vivo'' which can now be explored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''In vitro'' work is not without its own challenges. For example, one loses the natural structure provided by the ''in vivo'' tissue, and thus cell connections which could be important to the function of the tissue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Clinical ===
While rodent spermatogenesis is not identical to its human counterpart, especially due to the high evolution rate of the male reproductive tract, these techniques are a solid starting point for future human applications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Various categories of infertile men may benefit from advances in these techniques, especially those with a lack of viable gamete production. These men cannot benefit, for example, from sperm extraction techniques, and currently have little to no options for producing genetic descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fattahi|first=Amir|last2=Latifi|first2=Zeinab|last3=Ghasemnejad|first3=Tohid|last4=Nejabati|first4=Hamid Reza|last5=Nouri|first5=Mohammad|date=July 2017|title=Insights into in vitro spermatogenesis in mammals: Past, present, future|journal=Molecular Reproduction and Development|volume=84|issue=7|pages=560–575|doi=10.1002/mrd.22819|issn=1098-2795|pmid=28436137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, males who have undergone chemo/radiotherapy prepubertally may benefit from ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis. These people did not have the option to [[Cryopreservation|cryopreserve]] viable sperm before their procedure, and thus the ability to generate genetically descended sperm later in life is invaluable. Possible methods that could be applied (to this and other groups) are induction of spermatogenesis in testis samples taken prepubertally, or, if these samples are not available/viable, new methods that manipulate stem cell differentiation could produce SSCs ‘from scratch’, using [[adult stem cell]] samples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An alternative method is to graft preserved tissue back onto adult cancer survivors, however this comes with operational risks, as well as a risk of reintroducing malignant cells. Even if using this method however, ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis advances would allow for sample expansion and observation to better ensure quality and quantity of graft tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In those with healthy or preserved SSCs but without a cellular environment to support them, ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis could be used following transplant of the SSCs into healthy donor tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another group that could be helped by ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis are those with any form of genetic impediment to sperm production. Those with no viable SSC development are an obvious target, but also those with varying levels of spermatogenic arrest; previously their underdeveloped germ cells have been injected into oocytes, however this has a success rate of only 3% in humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finally, ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis using animal or human cells can be used to assess the effects and toxicity of drugs before ''in vivo'' testing.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

[[File:Cuerpo Incorrupto de La Siervita de Dios.jpg|thumb|400px|The body of [[Mary of Jesus de León y Delgado]], Monastery of St. Catherine of Siena found to be incorrupt by the Catholic Church ([[Tenerife]], [[Spain]]).]]
'''Incorruptibility''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] belief that divine intervention allows some human bodies (specifically [[saint]]s and [[Beatification|beati]]) to avoid the normal process of [[decomposition]] after death as a sign of their holiness. Bodies that undergo little or no decomposition, or delayed decomposition, are sometimes referred to as ''incorrupt'' or ''incorruptible''.

Incorruptibility is thought to occur even in the presence of factors which normally hasten decomposition, as in the cases of saints [[Catherine of Genoa]], [[Julie Billiart]] and [[Francis Xavier]].&lt;ref name="Quigley"&gt;{{cite book | last = Quigley| first = Christine| title =The Corpse: A History| publisher = McFarland| year = 2005| page = 254| isbn =978-0786424498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholicism==
In [[Roman Catholicism]], if a body is judged as incorruptible after death, this is generally seen as a sign that the individual is a [[saint]]. [[Canon law]] allows inspection of the body so that relics can be taken and sent to Rome. The relics must be sealed with wax and the body must be replaced after inspection. These ritual inspections are performed very rarely and can only be performed by a bishop respecting canon law. A pontifical commission can authorize inspection of the relics and demand a written report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/print49948.htm The Re-Vesting of the Relics of St. John of Shanghai &amp; San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; After solemn inspection of the relics, it can be decided that the body is presented in an open reliquary and displayed for veneration. Catholic law allows saints to be buried under the altar, so Mass can be celebrated above the corpse.

The relics of Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous|Bernadette]] were inspected multiple times, and reports by the church tribunal confirmed that the body was preserved. The opening of the reliquary was attended by multiple canons, the mayor and the bishop in 1919, and repeated in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicpilgrims.com/lourdes/bb_bernadette_body.htm|title=The Body of Saint Bernadette|author=|date=|website=www.catholicpilgrims.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every saint, however, is expected to have an incorruptible corpse. Although incorruptibility is recognized as supernatural, it is no longer counted as a miracle in the recognition of a saint.&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;Archived at [https://archive.is/20010610014402/http://www.discover.com/june_01/featsaints.html The Incorruptibles], ''The bodies of many medieval Catholic saints and martyrs have resisted decay for centuries— just the sort of mystery that begs for scientific inquiry'', By [[Heather Pringle]], ''Discover'' Vol. 22 No. 6 (June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Embalmed]] bodies were not recognized as incorruptibles. For example, although the body of [[Pope John XXIII]] remained in a remarkably intact state after its exhumation, Church officials remarked that the body had been embalmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandri |first=Luigi |title=Blessed John XXIII's Remains Are Now On View At St Peter's |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/juneweb-only/6-11-13.0.html?paging=off |website=Christianity Today |accessdate=11 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NIPsDkFx?url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/juneweb-only/6-11-13.0.html?paging=off |archivedate=11 February 2014 |date=1 June 2001 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally there was a lack of oxygen in his sealed triple coffin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Incorruptibility is seen as distinct from the good preservation of a body, or from [[Mummy|mummification]]. Incorruptible bodies are often said to have the [[odour of sanctity]], exuding a sweet or [[Flower|floral]], pleasant aroma.

== Eastern Orthodox Church ==
[[File:Anthony, John, and Eustathios in Orthodox Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius-2.jpg|upright|thumb|Relics of [[Anthony, John, and Eustathios]] at the [[Orthodox Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius]], Lithuania.]]
To the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], a distinction is made between natural mummification and what is believed to be supernatural incorruptibility. While incorruptibility is not generally deemed to be a prerequisite for sainthood, there are a great number of eastern Orthodox saints whose bodies have been found to be incorrupt and are in much veneration among the faithful. These include:
* [[Anthony, John, and Eustathios]]
* [[Saint Alexander of Svir]] – the incorrupt relics of the saint were removed from the Svir Monastery by the Bolsheviks on December 20, 1918, after several unsuccessful attempts to confiscate them. Finally, the holy relics were sent to Petrograd's Military Medical Academy. There they remained for nearly eighty years. A second uncovering of St Alexander's relics took place in December 1997, before their return to the Svir Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theorthodoxword.com/back%20articles/OW%20PDFs/236/A%20Brief%20Life%20of%20St%20Alexander%20of%20Svir.pdf The Marvelous Wonderworker of All Russia, Holy Venerable Alexander of Svir.

* [[Saint John the Russian]]
* [[Ioasaph of Belgorod|Saint Ioasaph of Belgorod]] – In 1918 the Bolsheviks removed Saint Ioasaph's relics from his shrine in the cathedral of the Holy Trinity at Belgorod, and for some seventy years, their whereabouts remained unknown. In 1927, the cathedral itself was demolished. In the late 1980s, the relics were discovered in [[Leningrad]]'s Museum of Religion and Atheism, and on 16 September 1991, they were solemnly returned to the new Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Our Lord in Belgorod, in the presence of [[Alexy II of Moscow|Patriarch Alexy II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nm/duga/sec041.htm ST.

During marble excavations on the [[Appian Way]] in Spring 1485, workers found three marble coffins. In one, twelve feet underground, was the corpse of a young woman, said to have looked as if it had been buried that day, despite being about 1500 years old. The corpse attracted 20,000 plus crowds of spectators in the first few days, many of whom believed it to be of [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia, daughter of Cicero]], whose epitaph was on one of the tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xqroj_IS9rwC&amp;pg=PT199&amp;lpg=PT199&amp;ots=SbdGUVuziC&amp;focus=viewport Translated letters about tombs on Appian Way, from ''Pagan and Christian Rome'' by Rodolfo Lanciani, 1896]&lt;/ref&gt;

Best known for her research on time, money and happiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Nancy|title=The Corporate Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1722637/corporate-pursuit-happiness|work=March, 2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker also focuses on the transmission of ideas through social networks, the power of story in decision making, and how to build global brands across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Brainiacs: Most Influential Women In Technology|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/women-in-tech/2011/brainiacs/jennifer-aaker|work=2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Profile:  Jennifer Aaker|url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/|publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the recipient of the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the [[Society for Consumer Psychology]] and the Stanford Distinguished Teaching Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Psychology Today |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |work=2014 |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306113958/http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Aaker was born in [[Palo Alto, California]], to Kay Aaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wake|first=Jennifer|title=The Gift of Time: Skilled Volunteers Found in Local Retirees|url=http://www.volunteereastbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The_Gift_of_Time.pdf|work=April 15, 2009|publisher=La Morinda Weekly|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Aaker]], a professor and brand consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David A. Aaker, Author Profile|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/David-A-Aaker/1451364|publisher=Simon and Schuster|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she studied under social psychologist [[Philip E. Tetlock]] and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Daniel Kahneman]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Psychology]] in 1989. In 1990, Aaker began postgraduate work at Stanford Graduate School of Business, earning a Ph.D. in marketing with a minor in psychology in 1995. Her dissertation on brand personality led to the publication of three academic papers  in ''Journal of Marketing Research'' and ''Journal of Consumer Research'' and won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors and Recognition |url=http://faculty.gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=2013 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aaker began her academic career in 1995 as an assistant professor at the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]].  In 1999, she returned to the Stanford Graduate School of Business as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 2001, and earned a full professorship in 2004. In 2005, Aaker was named General Atlantic Professor of Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaker CV at Stanford Graduate School of Business |url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=January, 2013 |publisher=Stanford University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722150424/http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been published in scholarly journals in psychology and marketing and has been highlighted in ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[Forbes]],'' [[NPR]], ''[[CBS MoneyWatch]]'', ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]].'' She serves as an advisory board member for several private companies.

As a social psychologist and marketer, Aaker began her research career by proposing a "Dimensions of Brand Personality" framework to describe and measure the "personality" of a brand, defined as the set of human characteristics associated with it. The five core dimensions are Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness.  In a global analysis of brands, Aaker and her colleagues revealed two novel brand personality dimensions. In Japan, individuals viewed brands as Peaceful, and in Spain, individuals viewed brands as Passionate.  Aaker’s model showed that brand personality dimensions influence consumer preference and choice and provided a framework that illuminated how to build strong global brands that meet multi-cultural needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaker|first=Jennifer|title=Dimensions of Brand Personality|date=August 1997|url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/Papers/Dimensions%20of%20BP%20JMR%201997.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Aaker shifted her research focus to understanding time, money and happiness. In this work, she suggested that time is a resource that, like money, is not only important but more subjective than we think. In 2010, she published two papers with [[Sepandar Kamvar|Sep Kamvar]] and Cassie Mogilner on the dynamic meaning of happiness.  Prior research had suggested that the meaning of happiness is either similar across individuals, or highly subjective and idiosyncratic.  Aaker and her colleagues show that the answer lies between the two and that there is in fact a predictable shift in the meaning of happiness and how it is experienced over one's life and even within the day or week. The research also showed that the meaning of happiness that one holds impacts the choices people make.

Aaker has also examined questions such as why people give to others, how small acts create significant change, and how those effects can be fueled by social media.

In 2010, Aaker and her husband, startup advisor Andy Smith, authored the book ''The Dragonfly Effect:  Quick, Effective and Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Drive Social Change.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.dragonflyeffect.com/|work=2013|publisher=Official Website|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    With a title inspired by the dragonfly’s unique ability to propel itself in any direction when its four wings worked in concert, the book examined the manner in which synchronized ideas can be used to create rapid transformations through social media. A literary award winner,[5] ''The Dragonfly Effect'' has been translated into over 10 languages. In 2013, Aaker, Smith and McCarthy published ''The Power of Stories'', a companion to ''The Dragonfly Effect'', which further explored social media through psychological insight and provided a hands-on tool to help companies put the model to work.

In a real world demonstration of the Dragonfly Effect, Aaker and her students founded 100K Cheeks,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Avril|title=Names You Need to Know|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avrildavid/2011/05/17/names-you-need-to-know-the-dragonfly-effect/|work=May 17, 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Stores|ISBN=1484184386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization dedicated to registering 100,000 South Asian donors in the National Bone Marrow Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Challenges (Get Involved) |url=http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |publisher=Haas Center for Public Service |accessdate=13 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221230214/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to utilizing social networks, Aaker ran the first ever cheek swab in India; as a result of these efforts, 100K Cheeks exceeded their goal by registering more than 115,000 potential donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.inktalks.com/discover/53/pursuit-of-happiness|work=November 27, 2011|publisher=Ink Talks|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beth Kanter Katie Delahaye Paine|first=Katie Delahaye Paine|title=Measuring the Networked Nonprofit: Using Data to Change the World|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-118-13760-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vL_lhYF0Uf4C&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=jennifer+aaker+100k+cheeks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/the_dragonfly_effect|work=October 2011|publisher=Stanford Social Innovation Review|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Social media is not inherently meaningful," Aaker said in an interview on the subject.

'''Life extension''' is the idea of extending the human [[life expectancy|lifespan]], either modestly &amp;ndash; through improvements in medicine &amp;ndash; or dramatically by increasing the [[maximum lifespan]] beyond its generally settled limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner BS |title=Can We Live Forever? A Sociological and Moral Inquiry |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2009 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to achieve such dramatic changes, however, does not currently exist.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;

Some researchers in this area, and "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], [[stem cell]]s, [[regenerative medicine]], [[molecular]] repair, [[gene therapy]], pharmaceuticals, and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] replacement (such as with artificial organs or [[xenotransplantation]]s) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|agerasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by [[bioethicist]]s.

The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50&amp;nbsp;billion of revenue a year in 2009.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt; The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holliday&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6 |pmid=18726707 |title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine |journal=Biogerontology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=223–8 |year=2008 |last1=Holliday |first1=Robin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name= EMBOSENS/&gt;

==Average and maximum lifespan==
{{Main|Senescence}}
During the process of [[aging]], an organism accumulates damage to its [[macromolecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by "genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2013 | title = The hallmarks of aging | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 1194–1217 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039 | pmid = 23746838 | pmc = 3836174 | author1 = López-Otín | first1 = C | last2 = Blasco | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Partridge | first3 = L | last4 = Serrano | first4 = M | last5 = Kroemer | first5 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxidation]] damage to cellular contents caused by [[free radicals]] is believed to contribute to aging as well.&lt;ref name="Halliwell B 2007"&gt;Halliwell B, Gutteridge JMC (2007). Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, USA, {{ISBN|019856869X}}, {{ISBN|978-0198568698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1383772 | volume=275 | issue=3–6 | title=Oxidative and other DNA damages as the basis of aging: a review | date=September 1992 | pages=305–15 | doi=10.1016/0921-8734(92)90034-M | journal=Mutation Research/DNAging| author1=Holmes | first1=G.

The longest a human has ever been proven to live is 122 years, the case of [[Jeanne Calment]] who was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a [[wildtype]] [[mouse]], commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years.&lt;ref name="Mouse Genome Informatics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/other/mouse_facts1.shtml|title=Mouse Facts|publisher=informatics.jax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant]] defenses, [[energy metabolism]], [[proteostasis]] maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senescence.info/causes_of_aging.html|title=What Causes Aging? Damage-Based Theories of Aging|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average lifespan in a population is lowered by [[infant mortality|infant]] and [[child mortality]], which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age-related [[chronic disease]] such as [[cancer]] or [[cardiovascular disease]] play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, [[vaccinations]], good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].

[[Maximum lifespan]] is determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as [[nematode]]s, fruit flies, and mice include [[caloric restriction]], [[gene manipulation]], and administration of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Aging biology: a new frontier for drug discovery | journal = Expert Opin Drug Discov | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 217–229 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2012.660144 | pmid = 22468953 | author1 = Verdaguer | first1 = E | last2 = Junyent | first2 = F | last3 = Folch | first3 = J | last4 = Beas-Zarate | first4 = C | last5 = Auladell | first5 = C | last6 = Pallàs | first6 = M | last7 = Camins | first7 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = The evolution of late life | journal = Ageing Res Rev. | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 14–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.arr.2005.06.003 | pmid = 16085467 | author1 = Rauser | first1 = C.

===Diets and supplements===
Much life extension research focuses on nutrition—[[diet (nutrition)|diets]] or [[dietary supplement|supplements]]— although there is little evidence that they have an effect. The many diets promoted by anti-aging advocates are often contradictory. {{original research inline|date=January 2015}}

In some studies [[calorie restriction]] has been shown to extend the life of mice, yeast, and rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=redmanCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Metabolic and behavioral compensations in response to caloric restriction: implications for the maintenance of weight loss | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2| page = e4377 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004377 | pmid=19198647 | pmc=2634841 | author=[[Leanne Redman|Redman LM]], Heilbronn LK, Martin CK, de Jonge L, Williamson DA, Delany JP, Ravussin E| bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4377R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=source6&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holloszy JO|author2= Fontana L | year = 2007 | title = Caloric restriction in humans | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 709–12 | doi=10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.009 | pmid=17482403 | pmc=2020845}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=mattisonCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Impact of caloric restriction on health and survival in rhesus monkeys from the NIA study | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7415| pages = 318–321 | doi=10.1038/nature11432 | pmid=22932268 | pmc=3832985 | author=Mattison JA, Roth GS, Beasley TM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2012Natur.489..318M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown.&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spindler |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Future of Aging |pages=367–438 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3999-6_12 |chapter=Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging |isbn=978-90-481-3998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free-radical theory]] of [[aging]] suggests that [[antioxidant]] supplements might extend human life. However, evidence suggest that [[beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] supplements and high doses of vitamin&amp;nbsp;E increase mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bjelakovic, Goran|author2= Nikolova, Dimitrinka|author3= Lotte Gluud, Lise|author4= Simonetti Rosa G.|author5= Gluud Christian | year = 2007 | title = Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention, a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8| pages = 842–857 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 | pmid=17327526}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resveratrol]] is a [[Sir2|sirtuin]] stimulant that has been shown to extend life in animal models, but the effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans is unclear as of 2011.&lt;ref name=Fer2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernández AF|author2= Fraga MF | title = The effects of the dietary polyphenol resveratrol on human healthy aging and lifespan | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–4 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21613817 | doi = 10.4161/epi.6.7.16499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hormone treatment===
The anti-aging industry offers several [[hormone therapies]]. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the [[American Medical Association]] has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite news |first=Bruce |last=Japsen |date=15 June 2009 |title=AMA report questions science behind using hormones as anti-aging treatment |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-15/news/0906140132_1_anti-aging-hormones-ama-council |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[growth hormone]] (GH) decreases with age, the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or [[IGF-1]] modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative.&lt;ref name=AgingMaleRev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sattler FR | title = Growth hormone in the aging male | journal = Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–55 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24054930 | doi = 10.1016/j.beem.2013.05.003 | quote = In animal models, alterations in GH/IGF-1 signaling with reductions in these somatotrophs appear to increase life span. &amp;nbsp;...

Studies relating GH and IGF-1 status to longevity provide inconsistent evidence as to whether decreased (somatopause) or high levels (e.g. acromegaly) of these hormones are beneficial or detrimental to longevity.&amp;nbsp;... It is difficult to reconcile the largely protective effects of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on longevity in animals with the inconsistent or deleterious effects of low levels or declining GH/IGF-1 during human aging.| pmc = 3940699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the Egyptian [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Smith medical papyrus]], all the way through the [[Taoists]], [[Ayurveda]] practitioners, [[alchemists]], [[hygienist]]s such as [[Luigi Cornaro]], Johann Cohausen and [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], and philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and Nicolas [[Condorcet]]. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called "[[fin-de-siècle]]" (end of the century) period, denoted as an "end of an epoch" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist [[Elie Metchnikoff]] (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Ilia|title=A History of Life-Extensionism in the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Longevity History|isbn=1500818577|url=http://www.longevityhistory.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He cites [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'', wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), founding member of the [[Royal Society]], also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as "to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young". Biologist [[Alexis Carrel]] (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with [[Cell (biology)|cells]], says Hughes.&lt;ref name="HughesTranshumanism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=James|author-link=James Hughes (sociologist)|title=Leadership in Science and Technology: A Reference Handbook|date=October 20, 2011|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=1452266522|page=587|chapter=Transhumanism|editor1-last=Bainbridge|editor1-first=William|editor1-link=William Sims Bainbridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the [[American Aging Association]] was formed under the impetus of [[Denham Harman]], originator of the [[free radical theory]] of [[aging]]. Harman wanted an organization of [[biogerontologist]]s that was devoted to research and to the sharing of information among scientists interested in extending human lifespan.

In 1976, futurists Joel Kurtzman and Philip Gordon wrote ''No More Dying. The Conquest Of Aging And The Extension Of Human Life'', ({{ISBN|0-440-36247-4}}) the first popular book on research to extend human lifespan. Subsequently, Kurtzman was invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Aging, chaired by [[Claude Pepper]] of Florida, to discuss the impact of life extension on the Social Security system.

[[Saul Kent]] published ''The Life Extension Revolution'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03580-9}}) in 1980 and created a [[nutraceutical]] firm called the [[Life Extension Foundation]], a non-profit organization that promotes dietary supplements. The Life Extension Foundation publishes a periodical called ''Life Extension Magazine''. The 1982 bestselling book ''[[Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach]]'' ({{ISBN|0-446-51229-X}}) by [[Durk Pearson]] and [[Sandy Shaw (writer)|Sandy Shaw]] further popularized the phrase "life extension".

Regulatory and legal struggles between the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, [[Saul Kent]] and Bill Faloon, the principals of the Foundation, were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a "Holocaust" and "seeking gestapo-like power" through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ty |last=Clevenger |date=Summer 2000 |title=Internet pharmacies: cyberspace versus the regulatory state |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |journal=Journal of Law and Health |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918191534/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] published "The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging," by [[Michael D. West]]. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=West, Michael D. |title=The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZnuAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-385-50928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern life extensionists include writer [[Gennady Stolyarov II|Gennady Stolyarov]], who insists that death is "the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology";&lt;ref name="stolyarov"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stolyarov|first1 = Gennady|title = Death is Wrong|date = November 25, 2013|publisher = Rational Argumentator Press|isbn = 978-0615932040|url = http://rationalargumentator.com/Death_is_Wrong_Second_Edition_Full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[Zoltan Istvan]], who proposes that the "transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else";&lt;ref name="istvan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Istvan|first1=Zoltan|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/the-three-laws-of-transhu_b_5853596.html |title=The Morality of Artificial Intelligence and the Three Laws of Transhumanism |publisher=Huffington Post |date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; futurist [[George Dvorsky]], who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved;&lt;ref name=aja&gt;{{cite web|title=Futurist: 'I will reap benefits of life extension'|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/fault-lines/articles/2015/5/7/futurist-itll-start-to-become-ridiculous-not-to-talk-about-curing-aging.html|website=Al Jazeera America|date=May 7, 2015|quote=To Dvorsky, aging is a problem that’s desperately in need of solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording artist [[Steve Aoki]], who has been called "one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension".&lt;ref name=tez&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tez|first1=Riva Melissa|title=Steve Aoki, Dan Bilzerian, a giraffe and the search for eternal life|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/steve-aoki-dan-bilzerian-a-giraffe-and-the-search-for-eternal-life|website=i-D|publisher=VICE|date=May 11, 2015|quote=Unknown to most, Steve is both an undeniable champion of life expansion as well as one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension.

[...] Set up by the Steve Aoki Charitable Fund, the profits from the Dan Bilzerian party went to life extension research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===

In 1991, the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) was formed. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alex |last= Kuczynski |date=12 April 1998 |title=Anti-Aging Potion Or Poison? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/style/anti-aging-potion-or-poison.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Aubrey de Grey]] and [[David Gobel]] formed the [[Methuselah Foundation]], which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the [[SENS Research Foundation]], a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sens.org/files/pdf/2011_Research_Report.pdf research report 2011]. Sens Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Google]] announced [[Calico (company)|Calico]], a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/tech/innovation/google-calico-aging-death/|title=How Google's Calico aims to fight aging and 'solve death'|author=Arion McNicoll, Arion |date=3 October 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Arthur D.

Barron]], [[David Botstein]], and [[Cynthia Kenyon]]. In 2014, biologist [[Craig Venter]] founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/human-longevity-inc-hli-launched-to-promote-healthy-aging-using-advances-in-genomics-and-stem-cell-therapies-248379091.html|title=Human Longevity Inc.

Aside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/health/young-blood-mice-aging/|title=Young blood makes old mice more youthful|author=Landau, Elizabeth |date=5 May 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/gdf11-protein-aging-mice-harvard/31929/ "Harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process"].

==Ethics and politics ==
Politics relevant to the substances of life extension pertain mostly to communications and availability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;!--Need some clarification here. The title implies the discussion is on the politics/ethics of all life extension practices, not just marketing of pharma/surgery--&gt;

In the [[United States]], product claims on food and drug labels are strictly regulated. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] ([[freedom of speech]]) protects third-party publishers' rights to distribute fact, opinion and speculation on life extension practices. Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, they are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. What constitutes the difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--This is just the opening paragraph, describing the political arena and stage of conflict. More to follow.--&gt;

===Scientific controversy===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, [[Leonard Hayflick]], who determined that [[fibroblast]]s are limited to around 50&amp;nbsp;cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of [[entropy]]. Hayflick and fellow [[biogerontologist]]s [[S. Jay Olshansky|Jay Olshansky]] and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging [[dietary supplement|supplements]].&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Position statement on human aging |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=B292–7 |date=1 August 2002 |pmid=12145354 |doi=10.1093/gerona/57.8.B292|author1=Olshansky |first1=S. J. |last2=Hayflick |first2=L |last3=Carnes |first3=B. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This may be a good place to link into the broader social debate on life extension ethics. Hayflick is not the only one to object to the portrayal/treatment of aging as a disease. Many doctors, social scientists, feminists, etc. do too--&gt;

===Consumer motivations ===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Feedback Information and Consumer Motivation.

===Political parties===
Though many scientists state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging |publisher=Imminst.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science |publisher=Fightaging.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon Valley===
Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes [[Larry Ellison]] (founder of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[Peter Thiel]] (former [[Paypal]] CEO),&lt;ref&gt;Veritas Forum Q&amp;A with Peter Thiel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQHrJvwnOzo&amp;list=PLCNNepS_4NcyOSlUdWOcTUCeUbK8nuywQ&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Page]] (co-founder of [[Google]]), and [[Peter Diamandis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Leon Kass]] (chairman of the US [[President's Council on Bioethics]] from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problems would make life extension unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Smith |date=3 December 2002 |title=Killing Immortality |url=http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040607195722/http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archivedate=7 June 2004 |publisher=Betterhumans |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states his opposition to life extension with the words:
{{Quote|"simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... [The] desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one's life and keep it; it is also an expression of a childish and [[narcissistic]] wish incompatible with devotion to posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Leon |last=Kass |authorlink= Leon Kass |year=1985 |title=Toward a more natural science: biology and human affairs |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-02-918340-3 |oclc=11677465 |page= 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2007) ''Enhancing Evolution: The ethical case for making better people''. Princeton University Press, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanist]] [[philosopher]] [[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |date=9 May 2006 |title=The ideas interview: Nick Bostrom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/09/academicexperts.genetics |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an extended metaphor entitled "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant", Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed.

Controversy about life extension is due to fear of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and possible effects on society.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2005/02/superlongevity-without-overpopulation-1.php|title=Superlongevity Without Overpopulation|work=Fight Aging!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogerontologist [[Aubrey De Grey]] counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate [[menopause]], allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus ''decreasing'' the yearly population growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-ethics-of-anti-aging-by-peter-singer|title=Peter Singer on Should We Live to 1,000? – Project Syndicate|work=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the philosopher and futurist [[Max More]] argues that, given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"/&gt;

===Opinion polls===

A Spring 2013 [[Pew Research]] poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an "ideal lifespan" to be more than 120 years. The median "ideal lifespan" was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Magalhães JP | year = 2014 | title = The scientific quest for lasting youth: prospects for curing aging | journal = Rejuvenation Res | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 458–67 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2014.1580 | pmid = 25132068 | pmc = 4203147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated,&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/|title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans’ Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension|date=6 August 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some variation exists between religious denominations.

==Aging as a disease==
Mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]] says: "I&amp;nbsp;don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayden EC | year = 2007 | title = A new angle on 'old' | journal = Nature | volume = 450 | issue = 7170| pages = 603–603 | doi = 10.1038/450603a | pmid=18046373| bibcode = 2007Natur.450..603H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not.&lt;ref&gt;Hamerman D. (2007) ''Geriatric Bioscience: The link between aging &amp; disease''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for [[AARP]], notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moody HR|title=Who's afraid of life extension?|journal= Generations|volume=25|issue= 4 |year=2002|pages= 33–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease.&lt;ref name=Gems1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Aging: To Treat, or Not to Treat? The possibility of treating aging is not just an idle fantasy | journal = American Scientist | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 278–80 | doi = 10.1511/2011.91.278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that [[Basenji]] are not dogs because they do not bark.&lt;ref name=Gems2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Tragedy and delight: the ethics of decelerated ageing | journal = Philos Trans R Soc B | volume = 366 | issue = 1561| pages = 108–112 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0288| pmc = 3001315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the universality of aging he calls it a "special sort of disease". Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms "aging syndrome" and "disease complex" in 1954 to describe aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perlman RM | year = 1954 | title = The aging syndrome | journal = J Am Geriatr Soc | volume = 2 | pages = 123–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.&lt;ref name=Gems2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15197284| year = 2004| author1 = Mehlman| first1 = M.

==Research==
Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme [[telomerase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rando TA|author2= Chang HY|authorlink2=Howard Y.

Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through [[genetic engineering]] and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and [[caloric restriction]].&lt;ref name=Shmookle&gt;{{cite journal | date = 2009 | title = Extreme-longevity mutations orchestrate silencing of multiple signaling pathways| journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1790 | issue = 10| pages = 1075–83 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.05.011 | pmid = 19465083 | pmc=2885961| author1 = Shmookler Reis| first1 = R. J.| last2 = Bharill| first2 = P| last3 = Tazearslan| first3 = C| last4 = Ayyadevara| first4 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review of longevity research noted: "Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a "life-extension factor" that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology."&lt;ref name=Shmookle/&gt;

===Anti-aging drugs===

There are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Childs et al. (2015). [http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n12/full/nm.4000.html Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy] Nature Medicine {{doi|10.1038/nm.4000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of research is related to the observed effects of a [[calorie restriction]] (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last2 = Shanmuganayagam| first1 = M. | first2 = D.| last1 = Anderson| title = Caloric restriction and aging: studies in mice and monkeys| last3 = Weindruch | first3 = R.| journal = Toxicologic pathology| volume = 37| issue = 1| pages = 47–51| year = 2009| pmid = 19075044| doi = 10.1177/0192623308329476| pmc = 3734859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet, which are known as [[Caloric restriction mimetic]] drugs.  Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR-mimic effect; they include [[rapamycin]],&lt;ref name=source25&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Rapamycin fed late in life extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice | journal = Nature | volume = 460 |pages = 392–5 | doi=10.1038/nature08221 | pmid=19587680 | pmc=2786175 | author=Harrison DE, Strong R, Sharp ZD, ''et al.''| bibcode=2009Natur.460..392H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[metformin]] and other [[geroprotector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2005 | title = Identification of Potential Caloric Restriction Mimetics by Microarray Profiling | journal = Physiological Genomics | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 343–50 | pmid = 16189280 | doi=10.1152/physiolgenomics.00069.2005 | author=Dhahbi JM, Mote PL, Fahy GM, Spindler SR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MitoQ]], [[resveratrol]] and [[pterostilbene]] are [[dietary supplements]] that have also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Kaeberlein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaeberlein|first=Matt|title=Resveratrol, pterostilbene and rapamycin:are they anti-aging drugs?|journal=BioEssays|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=96–99|doi=10.1002/bies.200900171|pmid=20091754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Low Dose of Dietary Resveratrol Partially Mimics Caloric Restriction and Retards Aging Parameters in Mice | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3| issue = 6| pages = e2264| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002264 | pmid=18523577 | pmc=2386967 | year=2008 | author=Barger JL, Kayo T, Vann JM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2264B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23691264 | doi=10.1155/2013/575482 | volume=2013 | title=A review of pterostilbene antioxidant activity and disease modification | pmc=3649683 | year=2013 | journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev | page=575482 | author=McCormack D, McFadden D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme [[telomerase]] in order to counter the process of [[telomere shortening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Telomeres and Telomerase Basic Science Implications for Aging | journal = American Geriatrics Society | volume = 49 | issue = 8| pages = 1105–1109 | doi = 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49217.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are potential dangers in this, since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0147| pmid = 16179494| title = Telomerase and Cancer: Kirk A.

===Nanotechnology===
Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated [[Cell (biology)|cell]] repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular [[computers]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical [[nanomachines]] (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Cloning and body part replacement===
Some life extensionists suggest that [[therapeutic cloning]] and [[stem cell]] research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as [[reproductive cloning]]) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Donald |last=Melanson |date=April 22, 2008 |title=DoD establishes institute tasked with regrowing body parts |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/22/dod-establishes-institute-tasked-with-regrowing-body-parts/ |publisher=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to [[transplant rejection|rejection]] and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Roxanne |last=Khamsi |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Bio-engineered bladders successful in patients |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8939-bioengineered-bladders-successful-in-patients.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.

The use of human [[stem cells]], particularly [[embryonic stem cells]], is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Christine |last=White |date=19 August 2005 |title=Umbilical stem cell breakthrough |url=http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720054316/http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |archivedate=20 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to [[reproductive cloning]]. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.

===Cyborgs===

Replacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the [[2045 Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;David Segal for the New York Times. 1 June 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 This Man Is Not a Cyborg. Yet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
{{Main|Cryonics}}
For cryonicists (advocates of [[cryopreservation]]), storing the body at low temperatures after death may provide an "ambulance" into a future in which advanced medical technologies may allow resuscitation and repair. They speculate [[cryogenic]] temperatures will minimize changes in biological tissue for many years, giving the medical community ample time to cure all disease, rejuvenate the aged and repair any damage that is caused by the [[cryopreservation]] process.

Many cryonicists do not believe that [[legal death]] is "[[Medical definition of death|real death]]" because stoppage of [[heart rate|heartbeat]] and [[breath]]ing—the usual medical criteria for legal death—occur before biological death of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Even at room [[temperature]], cells may take hours to die and days to [[decompose]]. Although [[neurological]] damage occurs within 4–6 minutes of cardiac arrest, the irreversible [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] processes do not manifest for hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Neuronal necrosis after middle cerebral artery occlusion in Wistar rats progresses at different time intervals in the caudoputamen and the cortex |journal=Stroke |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=636–42; discussion 643 |date=1995 |pmid=7709411 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.26.4.636 |author=Garcia JH, Liu KF, Ho KL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryonicists {{who|date=July 2017}}state that rapid cooling and [[heart|cardio]]-[[lung|pulmonary]] support applied immediately after certification of death can preserve [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] for long-term preservation at [[cryogenic]] [[temperature]]s.

No [[mammal]] has been successfully cryopreserved and brought back to life, with the exception of [[embryo cryopreservation|frozen human embryos]]. Resuscitation of a postembryonic human from [[cryonics]] is not possible with current science. Some scientists still support the idea based on their expectations of the [[technological singularity|capabilities of future science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imminst.org/cryonics_letter/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html |title=Advances in Cryonics |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategies for engineered negligible senescence===
{{Main|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|Genetics of aging}}
Another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of [[stem cell]]s and [[tissue engineering]], [[telomere]]-lengthening machinery, [[allotopic expression]] of [[mitochondrial]] proteins, targeted ablation of cells, [[immunotherapy|immunotherapeutic]] clearance, and novel [[lysosome|lysosomal]] [[hydrolases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |author2=Michael Rae |title=[[Ending Aging|Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2007 |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= 978-0-312-36706-0 |oclc=132583222}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genome editing]], in which [[nucleic acid]] polymers are delivered as a [[Biologic medical product|drug]] and are either [[gene expression|expressed]] as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Neuroendocrinology of Aging: The Potential of Gene Therapy as an Interventive Strategy |journal=Gerontology |date=2001-01-08 |first=Rodolfo G. |last=Goya |author2=Federico Bolognani |author3=Claudia B.

A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice.

The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind uploading===
{{Main|Mind uploading}}
One hypothetical future strategy that, as some suggest,{{who|date=July 2017}} "eliminates" the complications related to a physical body, involves the copying or transferring (e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail, and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Anders|last=Sandberg| author1-link=Anders Sandberg|first2=Nick|last2=Boström| author2-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap|quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.''|url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2013|series= Technical Report #2008‐3|year=2008| publisher = Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not an exact copy of one's mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate.

Some scientists believe that the dead may one day be "resurrected" through simulation technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bostrom |first=Nick|title=Are You Living in a Computer Simulation? |date=19 January 2010 |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young blood injection===

Some clinics currently offer injection of blood products from young donors. The alleged benefits of the treatment, none of which have been demonstrated in a proper study, include a longer life, darker hair, better memory, better sleep, curing heart diseases, diabetes and Alzheimer.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603242/questionable-young-blood-transfusions-offered-in-us-as-anti-aging-remedy/|title=Questionable "Young Blood" Transfusions Offered in U.S. as Anti-Aging Remedy|last=Maxmen|first=Amy|date=January 13, 2017|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=natpost&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/why-a-silicon-valley-company-is-pumping-old-people-full-of-young-blood-for-us8000|title=This anti-aging startup says US$8,000 worth of young blood can help you live longer|last=Kirkey|first=Sharon|date=November 2, 2017|work=National Post|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/teenagers-blood-transfusion-ambrosia-san-francisco-jesse-karmazin-a7902916.html|title=Teenagers' blood being sold for £6,200 a shot|last=Osborne|first=Samuel|date=August 20, 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2017/aug/21/ambrosia-the-startup-harvesting-the-blood-of-the-young|title=Ambrosia: the startup harvesting the blood of the young|last=Haynes|first=Gavin|date=August 21, 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/blood-transfusions-from-teenagers-start-up-charging-8000-apiece.html|title=This start-up is offering $8,000 blood transfusions from teens to people who want to fight aging|last=Farr|first=Christina|date=May 31, 2017|work=CNBC|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach is based on [[parabiosis]] studies such as Irina Conboy do on mice, but Conboy says young blood does not reverse aging (even in mice) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research.&lt;ref name=natpost/&gt;&lt;ref name=indep/&gt; Neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray, who also studied blood exchanges on mice as recently as 2014, said people offering those treatments are "basically abusing people's trust"&lt;ref name=vanfair/&gt;&lt;ref name=indep/&gt; and that young blood treatments are "the scientific equivalent of fake news".&lt;ref name=quartz&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/996190/ambrosia-says-a-transfusion-of-young-blood-plasma-lowered-disease-markers-in-a-human-trial/|title=A startup that charges $8,000 for young blood transfusions swears they’re worth every penny|last=Foley|first=Katherine Ellen|date=June 1, 2017|work=Quartz|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment appeared in HBO's Silicon Valley fiction series.&lt;ref name=vanfair&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/this-anti-aging-start-up-is-paying-thousands-of-dollars-for-teen-blood|title=This anti-aging start-up is charging thousands of dollars for teen blood|last=Kosoff|first=Maya|date=June 1, 2017|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1747">'''Megagametogenesis''' is the development of a [[megaspore]] into an embryo sac, which is the [[gametophyte]] - though a highly reduced one - stage in the life cycle of vascular plants. 

==Eudicots==

In [[eudicot]] plants, the entire process happens inside the [[ovule]] of a plant. The details of the process vary by species, but the process described here is common. This process starts with a single [[diploid]] megasporocyte in the nucleus. This megasporocyte undergoes [[meiotic]] cell division to form four cells that are [[haploid]]. Three cells die and one that is most distant from the micropyle develops into the megaspore. This megaspore becomes larger and the nucleus of it undergoes [[mitosis]] three times until there are eight nuclei. These eight nuclei are then arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus to the center of the cell which then becomes the polar nuclei. The three cells left at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. A cell wall forms around the other set of nuclei and forms the antipodals. The cells in the center develop into the central cell. This entire structure with its eight nuclei is called the embryo sac.

'''Peter Aaby''' ([[Danes|Danish]], born 1944 in [[Lund]], [[Sweden]]) is trained as an [[anthropologist]] but also holds a [[doctoral degree]] in [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="Winkel, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkel|first1=Klaus|title=Danskere i tropisk Afrika : fra slavehandler til bistandsarbejder|date=2011|publisher=Klim|location=Århus|isbn=8779559271|edition=1. udgave.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Peter Aaby established the [[Bandim Health Project]], a Health and Demographic Surveillance System site in [[Guinea-Bissau]] in [[West Africa]], which he has run ever since.&lt;ref name="Bandim, 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://bandim.org/about-bhp/background.aspx|website=Bandim Health Project|publisher=SSI|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Peter Aaby was awarded the [[Novo Nordisk]] Prize, the most important Danish award within [[Outline of health sciences|health research]].

Aaby is credited for the discovery of [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects of vaccines]] – i.e. effects of [[vaccine]]s, which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases.&lt;ref name="Prentice, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=AM|last2=Savy|first2=M|last3=Darboe|first3=MK|last4=Moore|first4=SE|title=Commentary: Challenging public health orthodoxies--prophesy or heresy?|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=April 2009|volume=38|issue=2|pages=591–3|pmid=19174540|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/2/591.short|doi=10.1093/ije/dyn363|pmc=2663722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of non-specific effects of vaccines was established in 1991 and later documented in several trials on [[measles vaccine]], [[BCG vaccine|BCG]], [[oral polio vaccine]], [[DTP vaccine]] and [[smallpox vaccine]].&lt;ref name="Benn, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benn|first1=CS|last2=Netea|first2=MG|last3=Selin|first3=LK|last4=Aaby|first4=P|title=A small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=September 2013|volume=34|issue=9|pages=431–9|pmid=23680130|doi=10.1016/j.it.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of Aaby’s work on non-specific effects of vaccines it has been recommended the WHO [[vaccination program]] in [[low income countries]] should be changed.&lt;ref name="Shann, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|title=Nonspecific effects of vaccines and the reduction of mortality in children.|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|date=February 2013|volume=35|issue=2|pages=109–14|pmid=23375475|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[WHO]] recently reviewed the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG vaccine, measles vaccine and DTP vaccine, and concluded that it would "keep a watch on the evidence of nonspecific effects of vaccination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Meeting of Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, 18-19 June 2008|pmid=18689006 | volume=83 |issue=32 | date=Aug 2008|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|pages=287–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Individualism sidebar}}
'''Rational egoism''' (also called '''rational selfishness''') is the principle that an action is rational if and only if it maximizes one's self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Baier (1990), p. 201; Gert (1998), p. 69; Shaver (2002), §3; Moseley (2006), §2.&lt;/ref&gt; The view is a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] form of [[wikt:egoism|egoism]]. It is distinct from [[psychological egoism]] (according to which people are ''motivated'' only to act in their own self-interest) and [[ethical egoism]] (that moral agents ''ought'' only to do what is in their own self-interest).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]] in the 1863 book ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Walicki|author2=Hilda Andrews-Rusiecka|title=A History of Russian Thought: From the Enlightenment to Marxism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev4ad5wKI9oC&amp;pg=PA196|year=1979|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1132-6|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chernyshevsky's standpoint was ultimately socialistic, and was criticised by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in the 1864 book ''[[Notes from Underground]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case against Rational Egoism in Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground |author=James P. Scanlan |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=60 |issue=3 |date=July 1999 |pages=549–67 |doi=10.1353/jhi.1999.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/context.html |title=SparkNotes: Notes from Underground: Context |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[SparkNotes]] |publisher= |access-date=2015-05-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] discussed rational egoism in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', first published in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; A method of ethics is "any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought' – or what it is 'right' for them – to do, or seek to realize by voluntary action".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick considers three such procedures, namely, rational egoism, dogmatic intuitionism, and [[utilitarianism]]. Rational egoism is the view that, if rational, "an agent regards quantity of consequent pleasure and pain to himself alone important in choosing between alternatives of action; and seeks always the greatest attainable surplus of pleasure over pain".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidgwick found it difficult to find any persuasive reason for preferring rational egoism over [[utilitarianism]]. Although utilitarianism can be provided with a rational basis and reconciled with the morality of common sense, rational egoism appears to be an equally plausible doctrine regarding what we have most reason to do. Thus we must "admit an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our apparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct; and from this admission it would seem to follow that the apparently intuitive operation of Practical Reason, manifested in these contradictory judgments, is after all illusory".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand ==
The author and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] also discusses a theory that she called 'rational egoism'. She holds that it is both irrational and immoral to act against one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006); Moseley (2006), §2a.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her view is a conjunction of both rational egoism (in the standard sense) and [[ethical egoism]], because according to [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]], egoism cannot be properly justified without an [[epistemology]] based on [[rationality|reason]]:

Her book ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964) explains the concept of rational egoism in depth. According to Rand, a rational man holds his own life as his highest value, rationality as his highest [[virtue]], and his happiness as the final purpose of his life.

Conversely, Rand was sharply critical of the [[ethical altruism|ethical doctrine of altruism]]:

{{quote|Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute is ''self-sacrifice'' – which means self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial self-destruction – which means the ''self'' as a standard of evil, the ''selfless'' as a standard of the good.
Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. This is not the issue. The issue is whether you ''do'' or do ''not'' have the right to exist ''without'' giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteem will answer: ''No.'' Altruism says: ''Yes.''"&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs it'', 1982, New American Library, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
Two objections to rational egoism are given by the English philosopher [[Derek Parfit]], who discusses the theory at length in ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;D. Parfit (1984), parts II and III&lt;/ref&gt; First, from the rational egoist point of view, it is rational to contribute to a [[pension scheme]] now, even though this is detrimental to one's present interests (which are to spend the money now). But it seems equally reasonable to maximize one's interests now, given that one's reasons are not only relative to him, but to him as he is now (and not his future self, who is argued to be a "different" person). Parfit also argues that since the connections between the present mental state and the mental state of one's future self may decrease, it is not plausible to claim that one should be indifferent between one's present and future self.

The "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]" model of [[evolution]] suggests that human (and animal) behaviors that seem altruistic are actually selfish, if viewed from the perspective of [[Gene|genes]]/[[Phenotype|phenotypes]].  People help each other "selflessly" because copies of their own genes also exist in others, so behaviors that help the genes survive are [[Natural selection|selected]] for, with the altruistic drive [[Kin selection|decreasing with genetic distance]].

'''Religion of Humanity''' (from French ''Religion de l'Humanité'' or ''[[w:fr:église positiviste|église positiviste]]'') is a [[secular religion]] created by [[Auguste Comte]], the founder of [[Positivism|positivist]] philosophy. Adherents of this religion have built chapels of Humanity in [[France]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://membres.lycos.fr/clotilde/temple.htm
|title = Où peut-on visiter un temple positiviste ? (Where Are Positivist Shrines to be Seen?)
|accessdate = 2007-10-30
|language = French
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Europe, Comte's ideas influenced others, and contributed to the emergence of [[ethical movement|ethical societies]] and "ethical churches", which led to the development of Ethical culture, [[religious humanism|congregational humanist]], and [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] organisations.

==Origins==
Comte developed the ''religion of humanity'' for positivist societies in order to fulfill the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. The religion was developed after Comte's passionate platonic relationship with [[Clotilde de Vaux]], whom he idealised after her death. He became convinced that feminine values embodied the triumph of sentiment and morality. In a future science-based Positivist society there should also be a religion that would have power by virtue of moral force alone.&lt;ref name = "soci"&gt;Rollin Chambliss, ''Social Thought: From Hammurabi to Comte'', Dryden Press, New York, 1954, p.424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the "[[positivist calendar]]", in which months were named after history's greatest leaders, thinkers, and artists, and arranged in chronological order. Each day was dedicated to a thinker.

==Tenets==
According to Tony Davies, Comte's secular and positive religion was "a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity", referred to as the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being). "This was later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Cosmic Space)".&lt;ref name = "dave"&gt;Davies, Tony. ''Humanism'', The New Critical Idiom. Drakakis, John, series editor. University of Stirling, UK. Routledge, 1997, p.28-29 {{ISBN|0-415-11052-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Système de politique positive'' (1851–1854) Comte stated that the pillars of the religion are: 
*'''altruism''', leading to generosity and selfless dedication to others.
*'''order''': Comte thought that after the [[French Revolution]], society needed restoration of order.
*'''progress''': the consequences of industrial and technical breakthroughs for human societies.

In ''Catéchisme positiviste'' (1851), Comte defined the Church of Humanity's seven [[sacrament]]s:
*'''Introduction'''; (nomination and sponsoring)
*'''Admission'''; (end of education)
*'''Destination'''; (choice of a career)
*'''Marriage''';
*'''Retirement'''; (age 63),
*'''Separation'''; (social extreme unction),
*'''Incorporation'''; (absorption into history) - 3 years after death.

==Liturgy and priesthood==
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre - Posse de Erlon Jacques de Oliveira 02.JPG|thumb|Erlon Jacques de Oliveira, Temple guardian in Porto Alegre|upright=1.2]]
The Religion of Humanity was described by [[Thomas Huxley]] as "Catholicism minus Christianity".&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt; In addition to a holy trinity of Humanity, the Earth and Destiny, it had a priesthood. Priests were ''required'' to be married, because of the ennobling influence of womanhood. They would conduct services, including Positivist prayer, which was "a solemn out-pouring, whether in private or in public, of men's nobler feelings, inspiring them with larger and more comprehensive thoughts." The purpose of the religion was to increase altruism, so that believers acted always in the best interests of humanity as a whole. The priests would be international ambassadors of altruism, teaching, arbitrating in industrial and political disputes, and directing public opinion. They should be scholars, physicians, poets and artists. Indeed all the arts, including dancing and singing should be practiced by them, like [[bard]]s in ancient societies.  

This required long training. They began training from the age of twenty-eight, studying in positivist schools. From thirty-five to forty-two a priest served in an apprentice position as teacher and ritualist. Only at the age of forty-two could he become a full priest. They earned no money and could not hold offices outside the priesthood. In this way their influence was purely spiritual and moral. The High Priest of Humanity was to live in Paris, which would replace Rome as the centre of religion.&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt;

==Influence==
Davies argues that Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity - viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) - "was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx".&lt;ref name = "dave"/&gt;

The ''system'' was ultimately unsuccessful but, along with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', it influenced the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and [[Harriet Martineau]], for the most part rejected the full panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour altrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").

Profound criticism came from [[John Stuart Mill]] who advocated Comte but dismissed his Religion of Humanity in a move towards a differentiation between the (good) early Comte, the author of ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' and the (problematic) late Comte, who authored the Religion of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;See the central passage of Mill's ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'': John Stuart Mill on Auguste Comte’s Religion of Humanity ([http://positivists.org/blog/archives/3719])&lt;/ref&gt; While sympathising with the need for a [[secular religion]], and appreciating Comte’s respect for “the Human Race, conceived as a continuous whole, including the past, he present and the future”, Mill thought that the details of Comte’s ritualism were not only illiberal but “could have been written by no man who had ever laughed”.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, in A Ryan, ‘’J S Mill’’ (London 1974) p. 234-5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Religion of Humanity in Brazil===
Comtean Positivism was relatively popular in Brazil. In 1881 Miguel Lemos and [[Raimundo Teixeira Mendes]] organized the "Positivist Church of Brazil." In 1897 the "Temple of Humanity" was created.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b3BA1k09JHUC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=%22religion+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=08euTo6046&amp;sig=PmQR3toJCZX2aCaXe8oUv7D5lvs&amp;hl=en Latin American Thought: Philosophical Problems and Arguments By Susana Nuccetelli: Page 184]&lt;/ref&gt; The services at the Temple could go on for up to four hours and that, combined with a certain moral strictness, led to some decline during the Republican period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SltigewTmMwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22temple+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=eWbqnsEKzY&amp;sig=H6m000aZeQIU8j6YvezXlN5ejbQ&amp;hl=en#PPA113,M1 The Human Tradition in Modern Brazil By Peter M. Beattie: Pages 112-113]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless it had appeal with the military class as [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] joined the group before breaking with it because he deemed Mendes and Lemos as too fanatical. [[Cândido Rondon]]'s conversion proved more solid as he remained an orthodox Positivist and a member of the faith long after the church's importance waned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vDHZJ433ficC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22positivist+church%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hQ8nhytmgT&amp;sig=v_-4WrrWtbHDmHF1tmoDnd1xNj0&amp;hl=en#PPA84,M1 Stringing Together a Nation: Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon and the... By Todd A. Diacon: pgs 83-84]&lt;/ref&gt; Although declined, the church still survives in Brazil. The national [[flag of Brazil]] bears the "Ordem e Progresso" ("Order and Progress"), inspired by Comte's motto of positivism: "L’amour pour principe et l’ordre pour base; le progrès pour but" ("Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal").&lt;ref name="historianet"&gt;[http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/default.aspx?codigo=934 Bandeiras e significados] Historianet.

== Other examples ==
There are more examples of Religion of Humanity started by positivists, and there are several authors who have given the epithet to the religion they support, whatever the religion. In India [[Baba Faqir Chand]] established [[Manavta Mandir]] (Temple of Humanity) to spread his religion of humanity with scientific attitude as explained by [[David C. Lane]] in a book ''The Unknowing Sage''. Comte influenced the thought of Victorian secularists [[George Holyoake]] (coiner of the term "[[secularism]]") and [[Richard Congreve]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9587">'''''Reproductive synchrony''''' is a term used in [[evolutionary biology]] and [[Behavioral ecology|behavioural ecology]]. Reproductive synchrony—sometimes termed 'ovulatory synchrony'—may manifest itself as 'breeding seasonality'. Where females undergo regular menstruation, '[[menstrual synchrony]]' is another possible term.

[[File:Ovulatory asynchrony enables male harem-holding.tiff|thumb|Figure '''a'''. Females competing for good genes should avoid ovulatory synchrony. Moving from one female to the next, a single dominant male under these conditions can exercise a monopoly. '''Key''': Circle = female. Pointer = ovulation. Triangle = male.]]
[[File:Ovulatory synchrony undermines male harem-holding.tiff|thumb|Figure '''b'''. Females in need of male time and energy should synchronise their cycles, preventing any single male from monopolising access.]]

Reproduction is said to be synchronised when fertile matings across a population are temporally clustered, resulting in multiple conceptions (and consequent births) within a restricted time window. In marine and other aquatic contexts, the phenomenon may be referred to as '''mass spawning'''. Mass spawning has been observed and recorded in a large number of phyla, including in [[coral]] communities within the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = P.L. | authorlink5 = Carden Wallace | last2 = Babcock | first2 = R.C. | last3 = Bull | first3 = G.D. | last4 = Oliver | first4 = J.K. | last5 = Wallace | first5 = C.C. | last6 = Willis | first6 = B.L. | year = 1984 | title = Mass Spawning in Tropical Reef Corals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 223 | issue = 4641| pages = 1186–1189 | doi = 10.1126/science.223.4641.1186 | pmid=17742935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Babcock | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Bull | first2 = G.D. | last3 = Harrison | first3 = P.L. | last4 = Heyward | first4 = A.J. | last5 = Oliver | first5 = J.K. | last6 = Wallace | first6 = C.C. | last7 = Willis | first7 = B.L. | year = 1986 | title = Synchronous spawnings of 105 scleractinian coral species on the Great Barrier Reef | url = | journal = Marine Biology | volume = 90 | issue = 3| pages = 379–394 | doi = 10.1007/BF00428562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In primates, reproductive synchrony usually takes the form of conception and birth seasonality.&lt;ref&gt;Brockman, D. K. and C. P. Van Schaik, 2005. Seasonality and reproductive function. In D. K. Brockman and C. P. van Schaik (eds), ''Seasonality in Primates. Studies of living and extinct human and non-human primates.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 269-305.&lt;/ref&gt; The regulatory 'clock', in this case, is the sun's position in relation to the tilt of the earth. In nocturnal or partly nocturnal primates—for example, owl monkeys—the [[lunar phase|periodicity of the moon]] may also come into play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fernandez-Duque | first1 = H. de la Iglesa | last2 = Erkert | first2 = H. G. | year = 2010 | title = Moonstruck primates: Owl monkeys ''(Aotus)'' need moonlight for nocturnal activity in their natural environment | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 9| page = e12572 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, L. T. 2007. Moonlight and behavior in nocturnal and cathemeral primates, especially Lepilemur leucopus: Illuminating possible anti-predator efforts. In S.L. Gursky and K.A.I. Nekaris (eds), ''Primate Anti-Predator Strategies.'' New York: Springer, pp. 173-205.&lt;/ref&gt; Synchrony in general is for primates an important variable determining the extent of 'paternity skew'—defined as the extent to which fertile matings can be monopolised by a fraction of the population of males. The greater the precision of female reproductive synchrony—the greater the number of ovulating females who must be guarded simultaneously—the harder it is for any dominant male to succeed in monopolising a harem all to himself. This is simply because, by attending to any one fertile female, the male unavoidably leaves the others at liberty to mate with his rivals. The outcome is to distribute paternity more widely across the total male population, reducing paternity skew (figures '''a''', '''b''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ostner | first1 = J | last2 = Nunn | first2 = C. L. | last3 = Schülke | first3 = O. | year = 2008 | title = Female reproductive synchrony predicts skewed paternity across primates | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume =  19| issue = | pages =  1150–1158| doi = 10.1093/beheco/arn093 | pmid = 19018288 | pmc=2583106| url = https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4454680/2583106.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive synchrony can never be perfect. On the other hand, theoretical models predict that group-living species will tend to synchronise wherever females can benefit by maximising the number of males offered chances of paternity, minimising reproductive skew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knowlton | first1 = N | year = 1979 | title = Reproductive synchrony, parental investment and the evolutionary dynamics of sexual selection | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1022–33 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(79)90049-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the cichlid fish ''[[Variabilichromis moorii|V. moorii]]'' spawns in the days leading up to each full moon (lunar synchrony),&lt;ref name=Rossiter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=A|title=Lunar spawning synchroneity in a freshwater fish|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=April 1991|volume=78|issue=4|pages=182–184|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01136210|accessdate=1 October 2013|doi=10.1007/bf01136210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and broods often exhibit multiple paternity.&lt;ref name="Sefc blue"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sefc|first=Kristina M.|author2=Karin Mattersdorfer |author3=Christian Sturmbauer |author4=Stephan Koblmüller |title=High Frequency of Multiple Paternity in Broods of a Socially Monogamous Cichlid Fish with Biparental Nest Defence|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2008|volume=17|issue=10|pages=2531–2543|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03763.x/full|accessdate=30 September 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2008.03763.x |pmid=18430146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same models predict that female primates, including evolving humans, will tend to synchronise wherever fitness benefits can be gained by securing access to multiple males. Conversely, group-living females who need to restrict paternity to a single dominant harem-holder should assist him by avoiding synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turke | first1 = P. W. | year = 1984 | title = Effects of ovulatory concealment and synchrony on protohominid mating systems and parental roles | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 33–44 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(84)90033-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turke, P. W. 1988. Concealed ovulation, menstrual synchrony and paternal investment. In E. Filsinger (ed.), ''Biosocial Perspectives on the Family''. Newbury Park, CA: Sage, pp. 119-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the human case, evolving females with increasingly heavy childcare burdens would have done best by ''resisting'' attempts at harem-holding by locally dominant males. No human female needs a partner who will get her pregnant only to disappear, abandoning her in favour of his next sexual partner.&lt;ref&gt;Power, C. and L. C. Aiello 1997. Female proto-symbolic strategies. In L. D. Hager (ed.), ''Women in Human Evolution.'' New York and London: Routledge, pp. 153-171.&lt;/ref&gt; To any local group of females, the more such philandering can be successfully resisted—and the greater the proportion of previously excluded males who can be included in the breeding system and persuaded to invest effort—the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowles | first1 = S | year = 2006 | title = Group competition, reproductive levelling, and the evolution of human altruism | url = | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = | pages = 1569–1572 | doi=10.1126/science.1134829 | pmid=17158320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence scientists would expect reproductive synchrony—whether seasonal, lunar or a combination of the two—to be central to evolving human strategies of reproductive levelling, reducing paternity skew and culminating in the predominantly monogamous egalitarian norms illustrated by extant hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Power | first1 = C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">The '''Sisterhood Method''' is a household survey to estimate [[maternal death]]s recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]. Although maternal deaths are a major problem in developing countries, high quality data are rare. Yet, numbers are needed for planning in order to reduce the problem of maternal death. Several methods have been used to estimate maternal deaths. According to the WHO, "The approach was designed to overcome the problem of large sample sizes and thus reduce cost."&lt;ref&gt;The sisterhood method for estimating maternal mortality: Guidance notes for potential users, page 5. WHO. Geneva, Switzerland. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indirect estimation of maternal mortality: The sisterhood method. Graham W, Brass W, Snow RW. Stud Fam Planning. 1989:20(3):125-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The death of a woman during or shortly after a pregnancy is an important medical problem in developing countries. 99% of all maternal deaths occur in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Maternal mortality in 2000: Estimates developed by WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA. AbouZahar C, Wardlaw T (Eds). WHO. Geneva, Switzerland. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the poorest countries in the world, e.g. Sierra Leone, the lifetime risk for a woman dying because of a maternal death is approx 1 in 6, whereas in developed countries, e.g. Sweden, the same lifetime risk is approx 1 in 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Maternal mortality: Who, when, where, and why. Ronsmans C, Graham WJ; Lancet Maternal Survival Series Steering Group. Lancet. 2006;368(9542):1189-200.&lt;/ref&gt; Half of all maternal deaths occur in six countries only: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Worldwide, maternal deaths decreased from approx 500,000 in 1980 to approx 350,000 in 2008. This decline in maternal deaths was associated mainly with better maternal education, maternal income, increased availability of trained birth attendants, and decreased pregnancy rates.&lt;ref&gt;Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980-2008: A systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5. Hogan MC, Foreman KJ, Naghavi M, Ahn SY, Wang M, Makela SM, Lopez AD, Lozano R, Murray CJ. Lancet. 2010;375(9726):1609-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimating maternal deaths==
Although maternal deaths are a major problem in developing countries, seen globally, the numbers are not very large, and there is an absence of high quality data. Yet, numbers are needed for planning in order to reduce maternal deaths. Several methods have been used to estimate maternal deaths. They include analysing census records and medical/death certificates,&lt;ref&gt;Underreporting of maternal deaths on death certificates and the magnitude of the problem of maternal mortality. Horon IL. Am J Public Health. 2005;95(3):478-82.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Reproductive Age Mortality Studies'' (RAMOS).&lt;ref&gt;National maternal mortality study, 2005. Carried out by: Haceteppe University Medical School, Institute of Population Studies. For the Turkish Ministry of Health, the General Directorate of Mother and Child Health and Family Planning, and the Delegation of European Commission to Turkey. Ankara, Turkey. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, household surveys are used. All of these methods are not totally precise, but they can provide some useful information to decrease maternal mortality.

In contrast, full surveillance programmes would be too costly and too unrealistic for many developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Measuring maternal mortality: An overview of opportunities and options for developing countries. Graham WJ, Ahmed S, Stanton C, Abou-Zahr C, Campbell OM. BMC Med. 2008;6:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sisterhood Method==
The Sisterhood Method is the most common household survey for estimating maternal deaths. It is time- and cost-effective, and reduces sample size requirements; in countries or areas with high levels of maternal deaths, i.e. over 500 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, a sample size of 4000 households or less is acceptable for this method.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.org/reproductive-health/publications/rht_97_28/RHT_97_28_chapter2.en.html&lt;/ref&gt; But the method still provides a useful means of assessing maternal mortality.

This method includes four questions about the sisters of the woman in question:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sisterhood Method for Estimating Maternal Mortality: Guidance notes for potential users|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1997/WHO_RHT_97.28.pdf?ua=1|website=www.who.org|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* How many sisters have you ever had, born to the same mother, who ever reached the age 15 (or who were ever married), including those who are now dead?
* How many of your sisters who reached the age of 15 are alive now?
* How many of these sisters are dead?
* How many of your sisters who are dead died during a pregnancy or during childbirth, or during the six weeks after the end of a pregnancy?

==Application==
Deaths occurring over a large interval of time are documented. The overall estimate of maternal mortality is determined for 10–12 years before the survey. The Sisterhood Method is useful because usually maternal mortality changes slowly. It provides some meaningful data in countries or areas where there are no alternative means of generating estimates.

==When should the Sisterhood Method not be used==
The Sisterhood Method is not appropriate in countries or areas where the total fertility rate is less than 4 children per family, in areas of significant migration, as well as during civil war, civil unrest or other significant social disruption.

==Variant ==
The original Sisterhood Method is an indirect method. The newer Direct Sisterhood Method targets a more limited reference period for sister deaths and uses more in depth questions (e.g., deaths among all siblings, all deaths that are pregnancy related, and when these deaths occurred). This variant relies on fewer assumptions than the original Sisterhood Method. However, it requires a larger sample size, data gathering and analysis are more complex, and has large confidence intervals. Despite these limitations, the Direct Sisterhood Method can result in greater specificity of information. A retrospective maternal mortality ratio (MMR) can be calculated. This variant is used by [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] (DHS).&lt;ref&gt;Direct and indirect estimates of maternal mortality from the Sisterhood Method. Rutenberg N, Sullivan JM (Eds). Washington DC, USA. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An assessment of DHS maternal mortality indicators. Stud Fam Planning. 2000:31(2):111-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''spermatheca''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|p|ɚ|m|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|k|ə}} plural: '''spermathecae''' {{IPAc-en|s|p|ɚ|m|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|s|iː}}), also called '''receptaculum seminis''' (plural: '''receptacula seminis'''), is an [[organ (biology)|organ]] of the female reproductive tract in [[insect]]s, e.g. [[bee]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Tales V. Pascini, and Gustavo F. Martins. 2017. "The insect spermatheca: an overview".

Spermathecae can sometimes be the site of [[fertilisation|fertilization]] when the [[oocyte]]s are sufficiently developed.&lt;ref&gt;Jan A. Pechenick. Biology of the Invertebrates.

Some species of animal have multiple spermathecae.  For example, certain species of earthworms have four pairs of spermathecae—one pair each in the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th segments. The spermathecae receive and store the spermatozoa of another earthworm during copulation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan A. Pechenik. Biology of the Invertebrates. New York: McGraw Hill, 2010, pg. 322&lt;/ref&gt; They are lined with [[epithelium]] and are variable in shape: some are thin, heavily coiled tubes, while others are vague outpocketings from the main reproductive tract. It is one of the many variations in sexual reproduction.

The nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' has two spermathecae, one at the end of each gonad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On the control of oocyte meiotic maturation and ovulation in Caenorhabditis elegans.|date = |journal = Dev.

"http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research".

The term "[[negligible senescence]]" was first used in the early 1990s by professor [[Caleb Finch]] to describe organisms such as [[lobsters]] and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]]s, which do not show symptoms of aging. The term "engineered negligible senescence" first appeared in print in [[Aubrey de Grey]]'s 1999 book ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging'',&lt;ref name="isbn1587061554"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2003).

==Framework==

[[File:Aging treatment approaches.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The arrows with flat heads are a notation meaning "inhibits," used in the literature of gene expression and gene regulation.]]

The ultimate objective of SENS is the eventual elimination of age-related diseases and infirmity by repeatedly reducing the state of senescence in the organism. The SENS project consists in implementing a series of periodic medical interventions designed to repair, prevent or render irrelevant all the types of molecular and cellular damage that cause age-related pathology and degeneration, in order to avoid debilitation and death from age-related causes.&lt;ref name=EndingAging/&gt;

De Grey defines aging as "the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us", and, more specifically, as follows: "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecule|molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an [[adult]] [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death."&lt;ref name="pmid12844502"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (January 8, 2003). "[http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/manu16.pdf An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging medicine]". ''Sci Aging Knowledge Environ''. 2003 (1): VP1. {{doi|10.1126/sageke.2003.1.vp1}}. {{PMID|12844502}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "[[geriatrics]] is the attempt to stop damage from causing pathology; traditional [[gerontology]] is the attempt to stop [[metabolism]] from causing damage; and the SENS (engineering) approach is to eliminate the damage periodically, so keeping its abundance below the level that causes any pathology." The SENS approach to biomedical [[gerontology]] is thus distinctive because of its emphasis on tissue rejuvenation rather than attempting to slow the aging process.

By enumerating the various differences between young and old tissue identified by the science of [[biogerontology]], a 'damage' report was drawn, which in turn formed the basis of the SENS strategy. The results fell into seven main categories of 'damage', seven alterations whose reversal would constitute [[negligible senescence]]:

For each of these areas SENS offers at least one strategy, with a research and a clinical component. The clinical component is required because in some of the proposed therapies, feasibility has already been proven, but not completely applied and approved for human trials. These strategies do not presuppose that the underlying metabolic mechanisms of aging be fully understood, only that we take into account the form senescence takes as directly observable to science, and described in scientific literature..

==Types of aging damage and treatment schemes==

===Nuclear mutations/epimutations—OncoSENS===
These are changes to the nuclear DNA ([[nDNA]]), or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain mutations can lead to [[cancer]].

This would need to be corrected in order to prevent or [[cure for cancer|cure cancer]]. SENS focuses on a strategy called "whole-body interdiction of lengthening [[telomere]]s" (WILT), which would be made possible by periodic [[regenerative medicine]] treatments.

===Mitochondrial mutations—MitoSENS===

[[Mitochondria]] are components in our [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for [[energy]] production. Because of the highly [[Oxidative stress|oxidative]] environment in mitochondria and their lack of the sophisticated repair systems, mitochondrial mutations are believed to be a major cause of progressive cellular degeneration.

This would be corrected by [[allotopic expression]]—copying the [[DNA]] for mitochondria completely within the cellular [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it is better protected. De Grey argues that experimental evidence demonstrates that the operation is feasible, however, a 2003 study showed that some mitochondrial proteins are too [[hydrophobic]] to survive the transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;Oca-Cossio, J. et al., 2003. Limitations of Allotopic Expression of Mitochondrial Genes in Mammalian Cells. Genetics, 165(2), 707–720.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intracellular junk—LysoSENS===
{{tone|date=January 2018}}
Our cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can’t be digested accumulate as junk inside our cells, which is detected in the form of [[lipofuscin]] granules. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]], [[liver spot]]s on the skin and all kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as [[Alzheimer's]] disease) are associated with this problem.

Junk inside cells might be removed by adding new [[enzymes]] to the cell's natural [[digestion]] organ, the [[lysosome]]. These enzymes would be taken from [[bacteria]], [[mold]]s and other organisms that are known to completely digest animal bodies.

===Extracellular junk—AmyloSENS===

Harmful junk protein can accumulate outside of our cells. Junk here means useless things accumulated by a body, but which cannot be digested or removed by its processes, such as the amyloid plaques characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other [[amyloidosis|amyloidoses]].

Junk outside cells might be removed by enhanced [[phagocytosis]] (the normal process used by the immune system), and small drugs able to break chemical beta-bonds. The large junk in this class can be removed surgically.

===Cell loss and atrophy—RepleniSENS===

Some of the cells in our bodies cannot be replaced, or can be only replaced very slowly—more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number affects some of the most important tissues of the body.  Muscle cells are lost in [[skeletal muscle]]s and the heart, causing them to become frailer with age.  Loss of neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] causes [[Parkinson's disease]], while loss of immune cells impairs the [[immune system]].

This can be partly corrected by therapies involving [[exercise]] and [[growth factor]]s, but [[stem cell therapy]], [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] are almost certainly required for any more than just partial replacement of lost cells.

===Cell senescence—ApoptoSENS===

[[Cellular senescence#Cellular senescence|Senescence]] is a phenomenon where the cells are no longer able to divide, but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other harmful things, like secreting proteins. Degeneration of [[joint]]s, immune senescence, accumulation of [[visceral fat]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called [[apoptosis]], to instruct cells to destroy themselves.

Cells in this state could be eliminated by forcing them to apoptose (via [[suicide gene]]s, [[vaccine]]s, or recently discovered [[senolytics|senolytic agents]]), and healthy cells would multiply to replace them.

===Extracellular crosslinks—GlycoSENS===

Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many [[cross-links]] form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including arteriosclerosis, presbyopia and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures that are part of the body, but not within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.

SENS proposes to further develop small-molecular drugs and [[enzyme]]s to break links caused by sugar-bonding, known as [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s, and other common forms of chemical linking.

==Scientific controversy==
While some fields mentioned as branches of SENS are broadly supported by the medical research community, e.g., [[stem cell research]] (RepleniSENS), [[Alzheimer's disease clinical research|anti-Alzheimers research]] (AmyloSENS) and [[oncogenomics]] (OncoSENS), the SENS programme as a whole has been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the SENS agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for SENS to be fully implementable in the foreseeable future&lt;ref name="pmid16264422" /&gt;. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an [[Aging-associated diseases|aging-associated disease]] (OncoSENS), but the SENS claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Best, BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging

| doi = 10.1089/rej.2009.0847 |  pmid=19594328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by material in the article [[DNA damage theory of aging]].

In November 2005, 28 biogerontologists published a statement of criticism in ''[[EMBO Journal|EMBO Reports]]'', "Science fact and the SENS agenda: what can we reasonably expect from ageing research?,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"&gt;Warner H ''et al.'' (November 2005). "Science fact and the SENS agenda. What can we reasonably expect from ageing research?". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1006–1008. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400555}}. {{PMID|16264422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing "each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; and that some of the specific proposals "will take decades of hard work [to be medically integrated], if [they] ever prove to be useful."&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; The researchers argue that while there is "a rationale for thinking that we might eventually learn how to postpone human illnesses to an important degree,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; increased basic research, rather than the goal-directed approach of SENS, is presently the scientifically appropriate goal. This article was written in response to a July 2005 ''EMBO Reports'' article previously published by de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (July 2005). "Resistance to debate on how to postpone ageing is delaying progress and costing lives". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (S1): S49–S53. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400399}}. {{PMID|15995663}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a response from de Grey was published in the same November issue.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2005). "Like it or not, life-extension research extends beyond biogerontology". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1000. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400565}}. {{PMID|16264420}}.&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey summarizes these events in "The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS," published on the [[Methuselah Foundation]] website.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey.

In 2012, [[Colin Blakemore]] criticised Aubrey de Grey, but not SENS specifically, in a debate hosted at the [[Oxford University]] Scientific Society.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

More recently, biogerontologist [[Marios Kyriazis]] has sharply criticised the clinical applicability of SENS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M |title=The impracticality of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: translational and pharmacological barriers |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=390–6 |year=2014 |pmid=25072550 |pmc=4142774 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kyriazis |first1=Marios |title=Translating laboratory anti-aging biotechnology into applied clinical practice: Problems and obstacles |journal=World Journal of Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=51–4 |doi=10.5528/wjtm.v4.i2.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that such therapies, even if developed in the laboratory, would be practically unusable by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M, Apostolides A |title=The Fallacy of the Longevity Elixir: Negligible Senescence May be Achieved, but Not by Using Something Physical |journal=Current Aging Science |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=227–34 |year=2015 |pmid=26135528 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/132663/article |doi=10.2174/1874609808666150702095803}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey responded to one such criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Grey AD |title=The practicality or otherwise of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: a response to Kyriazis |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=397–400 |year=2014 |pmid=25072964 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Technology Review'' controversy===

In February 2005, ''[[Technology Review]]'', which is owned by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published an article by [[Sherwin Nuland]], a Clinical Professor of Surgery at [[Yale University]] and the author of "How We Die",&lt;ref&gt;Nuland, Sherwin (1994). ''How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter''. New York: Knopf Random House. {{ISBN|0-679-41461-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that drew a skeptical portrait of SENS, at the time de Grey was a computer associate in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100108033304/http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/flybase.htm Flybase Facility] of the [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Genetics] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The April 2005 issue of ''Technology Review'' contained a reply by Aubrey de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (April2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14097&amp;ch=infotech Aubrey de Grey Responds]", ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous comments from readers.&lt;ref&gt;TR Readers (April 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14310&amp;ch=infotechReaders LETTERS: Our February cover story on Aubrey de Grey and antiaging science lives on]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 2005, [[David Gobel]], CEO and Co-founder of Methuselah Foundation offered Technology Review $20,000 to fund a prize competition to publicly clarify the viability of the SENS approach. In July 2005, Pontin announced a $20,000 prize, funded 50/50 by Methuselah Foundation and MIT Technology Review, open to any molecular biologist, with a record of publication in biogerontology, who could prove that the alleged benefits of SENS were "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate."&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (July 28, 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/pontin/14968/ The SENS Challenge]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Technology Review'' received five submissions to its Challenge. In March 2006, ''Technology Review'' announced that it had chosen a panel of judges for the Challenge: [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Anita Goel]], [[Nathan Myhrvold]], [[Vikram Sheel Kumar]], and [[Craig Venter]].&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (March 14, 2006). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/16593/ We've picked the judges for our biogerontology prize]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the five submissions met the terms of the prize competition. They were published by ''Technology Review'' on June 9, 2006. Accompanying the three submissions were rebuttals by de Grey, and counter-responses to de Grey's rebuttals. On July 11, 2006, ''Technology Review'' published the results of the SENS Challenge.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606111748/http://www.mprize.com/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&amp;ID=0104 SENS Withstands Three Challenges : $20,000 Remains Unclaimed]". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, no one won the $20,000 prize. The judges felt that no submission met the criterion of the challenge and discredited SENS, although they unanimously agreed that one submission, by [[Preston Estep]] and his colleagues, was the most eloquent. [[Craig Venter]] succinctly expressed the prevailing opinion: "Estep et al. ... have not demonstrated that SENS is unworthy of discussion, but the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for it."&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt; Summarizing the judges' deliberations, Pontin wrote that SENS is "highly speculative" and that many of its proposals {{clarify|text=could not be reproduced with the scientific technology of that period.|date=April 2016}} Myhrvold described SENS as belonging to a kind of "antechamber of science" where they wait until technology and scientific knowledge advance to the point where it can be tested.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invincible Man"/&gt; In a letter of dissent dated July 11, 2006 in Technology Review, Estep et al. criticized the ruling of the judges.

==Social and economic implications==

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | date = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

De Grey and other scientists in the general field have argued that the costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky ''et al.'' 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050.&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend&gt;Olshansky, S.

Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias.

== SENS Research Foundation ==
{{Main|SENS Research Foundation}}

The SENS Research Foundation is a [[non-profit organization]] co-founded by Michael Kope, [[Aubrey de Grey]], Jeff Hall, Sarah Marr and Kevin Perrott, which is based in [[California]], [[United States]]. Its activities include SENS-based research programs and [[public relations]] work for the acceptance of and interest in related research.

Before March 2009, the SENS research programme was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], co-founded by Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel.  The [[Methuselah Foundation]] is most notable for establishing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]], a monetary prize awarded to researchers who extend the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths.&lt;ref name=MFMission&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1251">'''Telescoping generations''' can occur in [[parthenogenetic]] species, such as [[aphid]]s or other life forms that have the ability to reproduce without ovum fertilization. This occurrence is characterized by a [[viviparous]] female having a daughter growing inside her that is also parthenogenetically pregnant with a daughter cell.

This pattern of reproduction can also occur in certain [[mite]]s that are not parthenogenetic, e.g. ''[[Adactylidium]]'', in which the young hatch and mate within the mother, eating her from the inside and then escaping; in some species the males never escape, and in others they die shortly afterwards. However, the resulting inbreeding has consequences much like those of parthenogenesis, and the females are not actually pregnant on hatching but become pregnant before emerging into free living.

'''Tendril perversion''', often referred to in context as simply '''perversion''', is a geometric phenomenon found in [[helix|helical]] structures such as plant [[tendril]]s, in which a helical structure forms that is divided into two sections of opposite [[chirality]], with a transition between the two in the middle.&lt;ref name=MacMillan2002/&gt; A similar phenomenon can often be observed in kinked helical cables such as [[telephone handset]] cords.&lt;ref name="LiuEtAl"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0093183| pmid = 24759785| title = Structural Transition from Helices to Hemihelices| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = e93183| year = 2014| last1 = Liu | first1 = J. | last2 = Huang | first2 = J. | last3 = Su | first3 = T. | last4 = Bertoldi | first4 = K. | last5 = Clarke | first5 = D. R. | pmc=3997338|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...993183L }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phenomenon was known to [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref name=Goriely2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/research/researchgroups/applied/siam/resources/SIAM_Day_2013_AGoriely_lecture.pdf|title=Inversion, Rotation, and Perversion in Mechanical Biology: From Microscopic Anisotropy to Macroscopic Chirality | author=Alain Goriely | date = 2013 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote in 1865,

{{cquote|
A tendril ... invariably becomes twisted in one part in one direction, and in another part in the opposite direction...
This curious and symmetrical structure has been noticed by several botanists, but has not been sufficiently
explained.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin, "On the movements and habits of climbing plants", ''Journal of the Linnean Society'', 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The term "tendril perversion" was coined by Goriely and Tabor in 1998 based on the word ''perversion'' found in the 19th Century science literature. "Perversion" is a transition from one chirality to another and was known to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who attributed it to the [[topologist]] [[J. B. Listing]].&lt;ref name=Goriely2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise of Electricity and Magnetism|author=James Clerk Maxwell|year=1873|publisher=Clarendon Press|place=Oxford|page=|quote=The operation of passing from one system to the other is called by Listing, ''Perversion''. The reflection of an object in a mirror image is a perverted image of the object.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tendril perversion can be viewed as an example of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], in which the strained structure of the tendril adopts a [[minimum total potential energy principle|configuration of minimum energy]] while preserving zero overall twist.&lt;ref name="MacMillan2002" /&gt; 

Tendril perversion has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. Gerbode et al. have made experimental studies of the coiling of [[cucumber]] tendrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1223304| pmid = 22936777| title = How the Cucumber Tendril Coils and Overwinds| journal = Science| volume = 337| issue = 6098| pages = 1087–91| year = 2012| last1 = Gerbode | first1 = S.

Generalized tendril perversions were put forward by Silva et al., to include perversions that can be intrinsically produced in elastic filaments, leading to a multiplicity of geometries and dynamical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Pedro E.

{{Transhumanism}}

'''Transhumanism''' (abbreviated as '''H+''' or '''h+''') is an international [[school of thought|philosophical movement]] that advocates for the transformation of the [[human condition]] by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly [[human enhancement|enhance human]] intellect and physiology.&lt;ref name="Mercer"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religion and Transhumanism: The Unknown Future of Human Enhancement|last = Mercer|first = Calvin|publisher = Praeger|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bostrom | first=Nick | authorlink = Nick Bostrom |title = A history of transhumanist thought|journal = [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]] |year = 2005 |url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/history.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of [[emerging technologies]] that could overcome fundamental human limitations as well as the [[technoethics|ethical]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/fuller20150909|title=We May Look Crazy to Them, But They Look Like Zombies to Us: Transhumanism as a Political Challenge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; limitations of using such technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Techno-human Shell-A Jump in the Evolutionary Gap | publisher=Sunbury Press | author=Carvalko, Joseph | year=2012 | isbn=978-1620061657}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common transhumanist thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the current condition as to merit the label of [[posthuman#Transhumanism|posthuman]] beings.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

The contemporary meaning of the term "transhumanism" was foreshadowed by one of the first professors of [[Futures studies|futurology]], [[FM-2030]], who taught "new concepts of the human" at [[The New School]] in the 1960s, when he began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and [[worldview]]s "transitional" to posthumanity as                  "[[transhuman]]".&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; The assertion would lay the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher [[Max More]] to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a [[futurist]] philosophy in 1990, and organizing in [[California]] an [[intelligentsia]] that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelles 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=transhumanism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Ctranshumanism%3B%2Cc0|title=Google Ngram Viewer |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by seminal works of [[science fiction]], the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives, including philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

==History==
===Precursors of transhumanism===
According to [[Nick Bostrom]], [[Self-transcendence|transcendentalist]] impulses have been expressed at least as far back as the quest for [[immortality]] in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], as well as in historical quests for the [[Fountain of Youth]], the [[Elixir of Life]], and other efforts to stave off aging and death.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

There is debate about whether the [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche]] can be considered an influence on transhumanism, despite its exaltation of the "[[Übermensch]]" (overman or superman), due to its emphasis on [[self-actualization]] rather than technological transformation.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorgner 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackford 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorgner 2012"/&gt; The transhumanist philosophies of [[Max More]] and [[Stefan Lorenz Sorgner]] have been influenced strongly by Nietzschean thinking.&lt;ref name="Sorgner 2009"/&gt; By way of contrast, The Transhumanist Declaration&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002"/&gt; ''"...advocates the well-being of all sentience (whether in artificial intellects, humans, posthumans, or non-human animals)".

The late 19th to early 20th century movement known as [[Russian cosmism]] also incorporated some ideas which later developed into the core of the transhumanist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sovieteramuseum.com/?product=art-works-by-russian-cosmism-painter-xx-xxi-ct-catalogue-of-exhibition-2013|title=Art works by Russian cosmism painter XX – XXI ct.

===Early transhumanist thinking===
[[File:Hux-Oxon-72.jpg|thumb|150x200px|left|[[Julian Huxley]], the biologist who popularised the term ''transhumanism'' in an influential 1957 essay.]]
Fundamental ideas of transhumanism were first advanced in 1923 by the British geneticist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in his essay ''[[Daedalus; or, Science and the Future|Daedalus: Science and the Future]]'', which predicted that great benefits would come from the application of advanced sciences to human biology—and that every such advance would first appear to someone as blasphemy or perversion, "indecent and unnatural". In particular, he was interested in the development of the science of [[eugenics]], [[ectogenesis]] (creating and sustaining life in an artificial environment), and the application of genetics to improve human characteristics, such as health and intelligence.

His article inspired academic and popular interest. [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]], a crystallographer at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], wrote ''The World, the Flesh and the Devil'' in 1929, in which he speculated on the prospects of [[space colonization]] and radical changes to human bodies and intelligence through [[bionics|bionic implants]] and [[cognitive enhancement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|title=Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds|publisher=St Martin's Griffin, New York|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have been common transhumanist themes ever since.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005" /&gt;

The biologist [[Julian Huxley]] is generally regarded as the founder of transhumanism after using the term for the title of an influential 1957 article. The term itself, however, derives from an earlier 1940 paper by the Canadian philosopher W. D. Lighthall.&lt;ref name="Harrison and Wolyniak 2015"/&gt; Huxley describes transhumanism in these terms:
{{blockquote|Up till now human life has generally been, as Hobbes described it, 'nasty, brutish and short'; the great majority of human beings (if they have not already died young) have been afflicted with misery… we can justifiably hold the belief that these lands of possibility exist, and that the present limitations and miserable frustrations of our existence could be in large measure surmounted… The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself—not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1957"/&gt;}}

&lt;!-- [[File:2001 NAL.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', published in 1968, which deals with the transhumanist agenda.]]
 --&gt;Huxley's definition differs, albeit not substantially, from the one commonly in use since the 1980s. The ideas raised by these thinkers were explored in the [[science fiction]] of the 1960s, notably in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', in which an alien artifact grants transcendent power to its wielder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/163072-googles-glass-castle-the-rise-and-fear-of-a-transhuman-future/|title=Google's Glass Castle: The Rise and Fear of a Transhuman Future|author=Christopher Hutton|publisher=PopMatters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese [[Metabolist]] architects produced a manifesto in 1960 which outlined goals to "encourage active metabolic development of our society"&lt;ref&gt;Lin (2010), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; through design and technology. In the [[Metabolism (architecture)#Material and Man|Material and Man]] section of the manifesto, Noboru Kawazoe suggests that:&lt;blockquote&gt;After several decades, with the rapid progress of communication technology, every one will have a “brain wave receiver” in his ear, which conveys directly and exactly what other people think about him and vice versa. What I think will be known by all the people. There is no more individual consciousness, only the will of mankind as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kenzo Tange and the Metabolist Movement: Urban Utopias of Modern Japan|last = Lin|first = Zhongjie|publisher = Routledge|year = 2010|isbn = 9781135281984|location = |pages = 35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity===
The concept of the [[technological singularity]], or the ultra-rapid advent of superhuman intelligence, was first proposed by the British [[cryptologist]] [[I. J. Good]] in 1965:
{{blockquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion,' and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.&lt;ref&gt;I.J. Good, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090420061605/http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Good-IJ/SCtFUM.html "Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine"] ([http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/pages/ultraintelligentmachine.html HTML] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128085512/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf |date=November 28, 2011 }}), ''Advances in Computers'', vol. 6, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Computer science|Computer scientist]] [[Marvin Minsky]] wrote on relationships between human and [[artificial intelligence]] beginning in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Minsky 1960"/&gt; Over the succeeding decades, this field continued to generate influential thinkers such as [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Raymond Kurzweil]], who oscillated between the technical arena and futuristic speculations in the transhumanist vein.&lt;ref name="Moravec 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 1999"/&gt; The coalescence of an identifiable transhumanist movement began in the last decades of the 20th century. In 1966, [[FM-2030]] (formerly F. M. Esfandiary), a [[futurist]] who taught "new concepts of the human" at [[The New School]], in [[New York City]], began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and world views transitional to [[posthumanity]] as "[[transhuman]]".&lt;ref name="FM-2030 1989"/&gt; In 1972, [[Robert Ettinger]] contributed to the conceptualization of "transhumanity" in his book ''Man into Superman.''&lt;ref name="Ettinger 1972" /&gt; FM-2030 published the ''Upwingers Manifesto'' in 1973.&lt;ref name="FM-2030 1973" /&gt;

===Growth of transhumanism===
The first self-described transhumanists met formally in the early 1980s at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], which became the main center of transhumanist thought. Here, [[FM-2030]] lectured on his "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]" futurist ideology.&lt;ref name="FM-2030: Are You Transhuman" /&gt; At the [[EZTV (media company)|EZTV]] Media venue, frequented by transhumanists and other futurists, [[Natasha Vita-More]] presented ''Breaking Away'', her 1980 experimental film with the theme of humans breaking away from their biological limitations and the Earth's gravity as they head into space.&lt;ref name="EZTV Media"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition: Science Slightly Over the Edge"/&gt; FM-2030 and Vita-More soon began holding gatherings for transhumanists in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], which included students from FM-2030's courses and audiences from Vita-More's artistic productions. In 1982, Vita-More authored the ''Transhumanist Arts Statement''&lt;ref name="Vita-More 1982"/&gt; and, six years later, produced the cable TV show ''TransCentury Update ''on transhumanity, a program which reached over 100,000 viewers.

In 1986, [[K. Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] published ''[[Engines of Creation]]: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology,''&lt;ref name="Drexler 1986"/&gt; which discussed the prospects for [[nanotechnology]] and [[molecular assembler]]s, and founded the [[Foresight Institute]]. As the first non-profit organization to research, advocate for, and perform [[cryonics]], the Southern California offices of the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]] became a center for futurists. In 1988, the first issue of ''Extropy Magazine'' was published by [[Max More]] and Tom Morrow. In 1990, More, a strategic philosopher, created his own particular transhumanist doctrine, which took the form of the ''Principles of Extropy,'' and laid the foundation of modern transhumanism by giving it a new definition:&lt;ref name="More 1990"/&gt;

{{blockquote|Transhumanism is a class of philosophies that seek to guide us towards a posthuman condition. Transhumanism shares many elements of humanism, including a respect for reason and science, a commitment to progress, and a valuing of human (or transhuman) existence in this life. [...] Transhumanism differs from humanism in recognizing and anticipating the radical alterations in the nature and possibilities of our lives resulting from various sciences and technologies [...].}}

In 1992, More and Morrow founded the [[Extropy Institute]], a catalyst for networking futurists and brainstorming new [[memeplex]]es by organizing a series of conferences and, more importantly, providing a mailing list, which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during the rise of [[cyberculture]] and the [[cyberdelic]] counterculture. In 1998, philosophers [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] founded the [[World Transhumanist Association]] (WTA), an international non-governmental organization working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a legitimate subject of [[scientific inquiry]] and [[Policy|public policy]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005"/&gt; In 2002, the WTA modified and adopted ''The Transhumanist Declaration.''&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002"/&gt; ''The Transhumanist FAQ'', prepared by the WTA (later [[Humanity+]]), gave two formal definitions for transhumanism:&lt;ref name="What is Transhumanism"/&gt;
{{blockquote|
# The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason, especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.
# The study of the ramifications, promises, and potential dangers of technologies that will enable us to overcome fundamental human limitations, and the related study of the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies.}}

In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations, WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their [[futurist]] visions and needed to be addressed.&lt;ref name = "Hughes 2004"/&gt; A particular concern is the equal access to [[human enhancement]] technologies across classes and borders.&lt;ref name="Utne"/&gt; In 2006, a [[transhumanist politics|political struggle]] within the transhumanist movement between the [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian right]] and the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal left]] resulted in a more [[centre-left]]ward positioning of the WTA under its former executive director [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]].&lt;ref name="Utne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Among the Transhumanists" /&gt; In 2006, the board of directors of the Extropy Institute ceased operations of the organization, stating that its mission was "essentially completed".&lt;ref name="Extropy Institute 2006" /&gt; This left the World Transhumanist Association as the leading international transhumanist organization. In 2008, as part of a rebranding effort, the WTA changed its name to "[[Humanity+]]".&lt;ref name="Newitz 2008" /&gt; In 2012, the transhumanist Longevity Party had been initiated as an international union of people who promote the development of scientific and technological means to significant life extension, that for now has more than 30 national organisations throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stambler |first=Ilia |title=The Longevity Party – Who Needs it?

The [[Mormon Transhumanist Association]] was founded in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |url=http://transfigurism.org/pages/about/ |work=Mormon Transhumanist Association |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, it consisted of hundreds of members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Member Survey Results |url=http://transfigurism.org/pages/about/member-survey-results/ |work=Mormon Transhumanist Association |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first transhumanist elected member of a Parliament has been [[Giuseppe Vatinno]], in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/italy-elects-first-transhumanist-mp |title=Italy elects first transhumanist MP |publisher=Kurzweilai.net |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
{{See also|Outline of transhumanism}}
It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of [[posthumanism]] and how this philosophical movement should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism. The latter is often referred to as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its [[Conservatism|conservative]],&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2004"/&gt; [[Christianity|Christian]]&lt;ref name="Hook 2004"/&gt; and [[Progressivism|progressive]]&lt;ref name="The Hedgehog Review 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coenen 2007"/&gt; critics.

A common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is the future vision of a new intelligent species, into which humanity will evolve and eventually will supplement or supersede it. Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective, including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement (i.e. [[biological uplift]]),&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004" /&gt; but clings to a "posthuman future" as the final goal of participant evolution.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2006"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bostrom | first = Nick | title = Why I Want to be a Posthuman When I Grow Up | url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/posthuman.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the idea of creating [[artificial intelligence|intelligent artificial beings]] (proposed, for example, by roboticist [[Hans Moravec]]) has influenced transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Moravec 1998" /&gt; Moravec's ideas and transhumanism have also been characterised as a "complacent" or "[[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]]" variant of posthumanism and contrasted with "[[cultural posthumanism]]" in [[humanities]] and [[the arts]].&lt;ref name="Cultural Critique 2003" /&gt; While such a "cultural posthumanism" would offer resources for rethinking the relationships between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines, transhumanism and similar posthumanisms are, in this view, not abandoning obsolete concepts of the "[[Agency (philosophy)|autonomous liberal subject]]", but are expanding its "[[prerogative]]s" into the realm of the [[posthuman]].&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999" /&gt; Transhumanist self-characterisations as a continuation of [[humanism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking correspond with this view.

Some [[Secular humanism|secular humanists]] conceive transhumanism as an offspring of the humanist [[freethought]] movement and argue that transhumanists differ from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological approaches to resolving human concerns (i.e. [[technocentrism]]) and on the issue of [[death|mortality]].&lt;ref name="Inniss 1998" /&gt; However, other progressives have argued that posthumanism, whether it be its philosophical or activist forms, amounts to a shift away from concerns about [[social justice]], from the [[social change|reform of human institutions]] and from other Enlightenment preoccupations, toward [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] longings for a [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] of the human body in quest of more [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|exquisite]] ways of being.&lt;ref name="Winner 2005" /&gt;

As an alternative, humanist philosopher Dwight Gilbert Jones has proposed a renewed Renaissance humanism through DNA and genome repositories, with each individual genotype (DNA) being instantiated as successive phenotypes (bodies or lives via cloning, ''Church of Man'', 1978). In his view, native molecular DNA "continuity" is required for retaining the "self" and no amount of computing power or memory aggregation can replace the essential "stink" of our true genetic identity, which he terms "[http://genity.org/ genity]". Instead, DNA/genome stewardship by an institution analogous to the Jesuits' 400 year vigil is a suggested model for enabling humanism to become our species' common credo, a project he proposed in his speculative novel ''The Humanist – 1000 Summers'' (2011), wherein humanity dedicates these coming centuries to harmonizing our planet and peoples.

The philosophy of transhumanism is closely related to [[technoself studies]], an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society and focusing on the changing nature of relationships between humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Public Affairs and Administration: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S51CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2192|year=2015|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-8359-4|page=2192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aims ===
[[File:PPTCountdowntoSingularityLog.jpg|thumb|300px| Ray Kurzweil believes that a countdown to when "human life will be irreversibly transformed" can be made through plotting major world events on a graph.]]
While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply [[reason]], science and technology for the purposes of reducing poverty, disease, disability and malnutrition around the globe,&lt;ref name="What is Transhumanism" /&gt; transhumanism is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level. Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]], while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating [[Congenital disorder|congenital mental and physical barriers]].

Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist ethical imperative]] for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition, but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to enter a [[transhuman]] phase of existence in which humans [[human enhancement|enhance themselves]] beyond what is naturally human. In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate participatory or [[directed evolution]].

Some theorists such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] think that the [[Accelerating change|pace of technological innovation is accelerating]] and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical technological advances, but possibly a [[technological singularity]], which may fundamentally change the nature of human beings.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/&gt; Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable. However, some are also concerned with the possible dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly. For example, Bostrom has written extensively on [[existential risk]]s to humanity's future welfare, including ones that could be created by emerging technologies.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"/&gt;

While many people believe that all transhumanists are striving for immortality, it is not necessarily true. Hank Pellissier, managing director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (2011–2012), surveyed transhumanists. He found that, of the 818 respondents, 23.8% did not want immortality.&lt;ref name="Pellissier, Hank 2012"&gt;Pellissier, Hank. "Do all Transhumanists Want Immortality? No? Why Not?" Futurist 46.6 (2012): 65-. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons argued were boredom, Earth's overpopulation and the desire "to go to an afterlife".&lt;ref name="Pellissier, Hank 2012"/&gt;

=== Empathic fallibility and conversational consent ===
{{See also|Uplift (science fiction)}}
Certain transhumanist philosophers hold that since all assumptions about what others experience [[fallibility|are fallible]], and that therefore all attempts to help or protect beings that are not capable of correcting what others assume about them no matter how well-intentioned are in danger of actually hurting them, all [[sentience|sentient]] beings deserve to be [[sapience|sapient]]. These thinkers argue that the ability to discuss in a [[falsifiability|falsification-based]] way constitutes a [[critical phenomena|threshold that is not arbitrary]] at which it becomes possible for an individual to speak for themself in a way that is not dependent on exterior assumptions. They also argue that all beings capable of experiencing something deserve to be elevated to this threshold if they are not at it, typically stating that the underlying change that leads to the threshold is an increase in the preciseness of the [[brain]]'s ability to discriminate. This includes increasing the neuron count and connectivity in animals as well as accelerating the development of connectivity in order to shorten or ideally skip non-sapient childhood incapable of independently deciding for oneself. Transhumanists of this description stress that the genetic engineering that they advocate is general insertion into both the somatic cells of living beings and in germ cells, and not purging of individuals without the modifications, deeming the latter not only unethical but also unnecessary due to the possibilities of efficient genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Human Purpose and Transhuman Potential: A Cosmic Vision of Our Future Evolution, Ted Chu 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The thinker's guide to ethical reasoning, Linda Elder and Richard Paul 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Think about Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age Theodore Schick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ten Billion Tomorrows: How Science Fiction Technology Became Reality and Shapes the Future, Brian Clegg 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics ===
{{Humanism}}
Transhumanists engage in [[interdisciplinary]] approaches to understand and evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on [[futurology]] and various fields of ethics.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Unlike many philosophers, social critics and activists who place a moral value on preservation of [[nature|natural]] systems, transhumanists see the very concept of the specifically [[Appeal to nature|natural]] as problematically nebulous at best and an obstacle to progress at worst.&lt;ref name="Bostrom, Sandberg 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Nick Bostrom|Bostrom, Nick]] &amp; [[Anders Sandberg|Sandberg, Anders]]| title = The Wisdom of Nature: An Evolutionary Heuristic for Human Enhancement| year = 2007| url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/evolution.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this, many prominent transhumanist advocates, such as Dan Agin, refer to transhumanism's critics, on the political right and left jointly, as "[[Bioconservatism|bioconservatives]]" or "[[neo-luddism|bioluddites]]", the latter term alluding to the 19th century [[luddite|anti-industrialisation]] social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"/&gt;

A belief of counter-transhumanism is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement in many areas of life, but specifically on the social plane. This can be compared to steroid use, where athletes who use steroids in sports have an advantage over those who do not. The same scenario happens when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the work place and in educational aspects.&lt;ref name="Tennison 2012"/&gt;

=== Currents ===
There is a variety of opinions within transhumanist thought. Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development.&lt;ref name="WTA FAQ 5.2"/&gt; Some distinctive currents of transhumanism are identified and listed here in alphabetical order:
* [[Democratic transhumanism]], a political ideology synthesizing [[liberal democracy]], [[social democracy]], [[radical democracy]] and transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Hughes A2002"/&gt;
*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326693925_Extrapolitical_Theory_and_Postpoliticism Postpoliticism],  a transhumanist political proposal that aims to create a Postdemocratic state based on reason and free access of enhancement technologies to people. It tries to overcome the four traditional political theories (liberalism, socialism, nationalism, conservatism) while adding the best, if had, of them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327756347_Extrapolitical_Theory_and_Postpoliticism_-_A_Transhumanist_Political_Theory|title=Extrapolitical Theory and Postpoliticism - A Transhumanist Political Theory|last=Gayozzo|first=Piero|date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Extropianism]], an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a [[Proactionary principle|proactive approach]] to human evolution.&lt;ref name="More 1990"/&gt;
* [[Immortalism]], a moral ideology based upon the belief that radical [[life extension]] and [[Immortality#Technological immortality|technological immortality]] is possible and desirable, and advocating research and development to ensure its realization.&lt;ref name="imminst"/&gt;
* [[Libertarian transhumanism]], a political ideology synthesizing [[libertarianism]] and transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"/&gt;
* [[Postgenderism]], a social philosophy which seeks the voluntary elimination of [[gender]] in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and [[reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technologies]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008" /&gt;
* Prometheism, a pro-nazi and fascist transhumanist proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm|title=The Politics of Transhumanism|website=www.changesurfer.com|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[Singularitarianism]], a moral ideology based upon the belief that a [[technological singularity]] is possible, and advocating deliberate action to effect it and ensure its safety.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005" /&gt;
* [[Technogaianism]], an ecological ideology based upon the belief that emerging technologies can help restore Earth's environment and that developing safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]] should therefore be an important goal of [[environmentalist]]s.&lt;ref name="Hughes A2002" /&gt;

=== Spirituality ===
Although many transhumanists are [[atheism|atheists]], [[agnosticism|agnostics]], and/or [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], some have [[religion|religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] views.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005"/&gt; Despite the prevailing secular attitude, some transhumanists pursue hopes traditionally espoused by religions, such as [[immortality]],&lt;ref name =imminst/&gt; while several controversial [[new religious movement]]s from the late 20th century have explicitly embraced transhumanist goals of transforming the human condition by applying technology to the alteration of the mind and body, such as [[Raëlism]].&lt;ref name="Rael 2002"/&gt; However, most thinkers associated with the transhumanist movement focus on the practical goals of using technology to help achieve longer and healthier lives, while speculating that future understanding of [[neurotheology]] and the application of [[neurotechnology]] will enable humans to gain greater control of [[altered states of consciousness]], which were commonly interpreted as [[spiritual experience]]s, and thus achieve more profound [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Hughes BH 2004"/&gt; Transhumanist Buddhists have sought to explore areas of agreement between various types of Buddhism and Buddhist-derived meditation and mind expanding "neurotechnologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/cyborgbuddha|title=IEET Cyborg Buddha Project|work=ieet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have been criticised for appropriating mindfulness as a tool for transcending humanness.&lt;ref name="Evans 2014"/&gt;

Some transhumanists believe in the compatibility between the human mind and computer hardware, with the theoretical implication that human [[consciousness]] may someday be transferred to alternative media (a speculative technique commonly known as [[mind uploading]]).&lt;ref name="Sandberg 2000"/&gt; One extreme formulation of this idea, which some transhumanists are interested in, is the proposal of the [[Omega Point]] by Christian cosmologist [[Frank J. Tipler|Frank Tipler]]. Drawing upon ideas in [[Digital philosophy|digitalism]], Tipler has advanced the notion that the collapse of the [[Universe]] billions of years hence could create the conditions for the perpetuation of humanity in a [[simulated reality]] within a megacomputer and thus achieve a form of "[[posthuman God|posthuman godhood]]". Tipler's thought was inspired by the writings of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[paleontologist]] and [[Jesuit]] theologian who saw an evolutionary [[telos (philosophy)|telos]] in the development of an encompassing [[noosphere]], a global consciousness.&lt;ref name="tipler1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://jetpress.org/v20/steinhart.htm?pagewanted=all |title=Teilhard de Chardin and Transhumanism |author=Eric Steinhart |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=December 2008 |pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Transhumanism and Transcendence |author=Michael S.

Viewed from the perspective of some [[Christian]] thinkers, the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a [[Transhumanism#Contempt for the flesh|denigration of the human body]], characteristic of [[gnostic]] manichaean belief.&lt;ref name="Pauls 2005"/&gt; Transhumanism and its presumed intellectual progenitors have also been described as [[Gnosticism in modern times|neo-gnostic]] by non-Christian and secular commentators.&lt;ref name="Giesen 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis 1999"/&gt;

The first dialogue between transhumanism and [[faith]] was a one-day conference held at the [[University of Toronto]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Walker 2005"/&gt; Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor a relationship with the [[divinity|divine]]. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of [[postmodern]] [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] and [[anomie]]. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in [[optimistic]], idealistic attitudes that trace back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="TransVision 2004: Faith, Transhumanism and Hope Symposium"/&gt; Following this dialogue, [[William Sims Bainbridge]], a [[sociology of religion|sociologist of religion]], conducted a pilot study, published in the [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]], suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge"/&gt;

Since 2006, the [[Mormon Transhumanist Association]] sponsors conferences and lectures on the intersection of technology and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mormon Transhumanist Association |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/transfigurism |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the [[American Academy of Religion]] holds a "Transhumanism and Religion" consultation during its annual meeting, where scholars in the field of [[religious studies]] seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions; consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future, in particular the prospect of human transformation, whether by technological or other means; and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology, robotics and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species.&lt;ref name="AAR: Transhumanism and Religion Consultations"/&gt;

The physicist and transhumanist thinker [[Giulio Prisco]] states that "cosmist religions based on science, might be our best protection from reckless pursuit of superintelligence and other risky technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Turing Church | title=Religion as Protection From Reckless Pursuit of Superintelligence and Other Risky Technologies | date=September 9, 2014 | url=http://turingchurch.com/2014/09/09/religion-as-protection-from-reckless-pursuit-of-superintelligence-and-other-risky-technologies/ | author=Giulio Prisco | access-date=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisco also recognizes the importance of spiritual ideas, such as the ones of [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]], to the origins of the transhumanism movement.

== Practice ==
While some transhumanists{{who|date=October 2014}} take an abstract and theoretical approach to the perceived benefits of emerging technologies, others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body, including heritable ones. Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human [[nervous system]]. Though some, such as [[Kevin Warwick]], propose modification of the [[peripheral nervous system]], the [[human brain|brain]] is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions.&lt;ref name="Walker 2002"/&gt;

In fact, Warwick has gone a lot further than merely making a proposal. In 2002 he had a 100 electrode array surgically implanted into the median nerves of his left arm in order to link his nervous system directly with a computer and thus to also connect with the internet. As a consequence, he carried out a series of experiments. He was able to directly control a robot hand using his neural signals and to feel the force applied by the hand through feedback from the fingertips. He also experienced a form of ultrasonic sensory input and conducted the first purely electronic communication between his own nervous system and that of his wife who also had electrodes implanted.&lt;ref name="doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369| pmid = 14568806| title = The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems| journal = Archives of Neurology| volume = 60| issue = 10| pages = 1369–73| year = 2003| last1 = Warwick | first1 = K. | last2 = Gasson | first2 = M. | last3 = Hutt | first3 = B. | last4 = Goodhew | first4 = I. | last5 = Kyberd | first5 = P. | last6 = Andrews | first6 = B. | last7 = Teddy | first7 = P. | last8 = Shad | first8 = A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As proponents of [[self-improvement]] and [[body modification]], including [[transitioning (transgender)|gender transitioning]], transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance, while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 1993"/&gt; Depending on their age, some{{who|date=October 2014}} transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies. However, many have a great interest in [[life extension]] strategies and in funding research in [[cryonics]] in order to make the latter a viable option of last resort, rather than remaining an unproven method.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2004"/&gt; Regional and global transhumanist networks and communities with a range of objectives exist to provide support and forums for discussion and collaborative projects.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Technologies of interest ===
{{Main|Human enhancement technologies}}
[[File:Converging technologies.png|thumb|''Converging Technologies'', a 2002 report exploring the potential for synergy among nano-, bio-, info- and cogno-technologies, has become a landmark in near-future technological speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtec.org/ConvergingTechnologies/Report/welcome.htm |title=''Converging Technologies'' |publisher=Wtec.org |date= |accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Transhumanists support the [[emerging technologies|emergence]] and [[converging technologies|convergence]] of technologies including [[nanotechnology]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and [[cognitive science]] (NBIC), as well as hypothetical future technologies like [[simulated reality]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[superintelligence]], [[3D bioprinting]], [[mind uploading]], chemical brain preservation and [[cryonics]]. They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become [[superhuman|more than human]].&lt;ref name="Naam 2005"/&gt; Therefore, they support the recognition and/or protection of [[cognitive liberty]], [[morphological freedom]] and [[procreative liberty]] as [[civil liberties]], so as to guarantee individuals the choice of using [[human enhancement technologies]] on themselves and their children.&lt;ref name="Sandberg 2001"/&gt; Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than at the midpoint of the 21st century. Kurzweil's book ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' and Michio Kaku's book ''[[Physics of the Future]]'' outline various human enhancement technologies and give insight on how these technologies may impact the human race.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaku|first=Michio|title=Physics of the Future|year=2011|publisher=Doubleday|location=United States|pages=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reports on the converging technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged [[science fiction]]al character.&lt;ref name="The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004"/&gt; At the same time, research on brain and body alteration technologies has been accelerated under the sponsorship of the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], which is interested in the battlefield advantages they would provide to the [[supersoldier]]s of the United States and its allies.&lt;ref name="Moreno 2006"/&gt; There has already been a brain research program to "extend the ability to manage information", while military scientists are now looking at stretching the human capacity for combat to a maximum 168 hours without sleep.&lt;ref name="Managing Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno Innovations: Converging Technologies in Society"/&gt;

Neuroscientist [[Anders Sandberg]] has been practicing on the method of scanning ultra-thin sections of the brain. This method is being used to help better understand the architecture of the brain. As of now, this method is currently being used on mice. This is the first step towards uploading contents of the human brain, including memories and emotions, onto a computer.&lt;ref name="Sandberg 2009"/&gt;

== Arts and culture ==
{{Main|Transhumanism in fiction}}
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Transhumanist themes have become increasingly prominent in various literary forms during the period in which the movement itself has emerged. Contemporary [[science fiction]] often contains positive renditions of technologically enhanced human life set in [[utopia]]n (especially [[techno-utopia]]n) societies. However, science fiction's depictions of enhanced humans or other posthuman beings frequently come with a cautionary twist. The more pessimistic scenarios include many [[horror fiction|horrific]] or [[dystopia]]n tales of human [[bioengineering]] gone wrong. In the decades immediately before transhumanism emerged as an explicit movement, many transhumanist concepts and themes began appearing in the speculative fiction of authors of the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]] such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]] ([[Lazarus Long]] series, 1941–87), [[A. E. van Vogt]] (''[[Slan]]'', 1946), [[Isaac Asimov]] (''[[I, Robot]]'', 1950), [[Arthur C. Clarke]] (''[[Childhood's End]]'', 1953) and [[Stanisław Lem]] (''[[Cyberiad]]'', 1967).&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' (1945) contains an early critique of transhumanism.

In a series of science fiction novels by [[Neal Asher]], the protagonist is an augmented human who carries out missions for "Earth Central Security", an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[superhuman]] coalition. The author portrays a variety of augmentations in addition to the copying of memory and human minds into crystals and the presence of both benevolent and malevolent artificial intelligences.

The [[cyberpunk]] genre, exemplified by [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984) and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s ''[[Schismatrix]]'' (1985), has particularly been concerned with the modification of human bodies. Other novels dealing with transhumanist themes that have stimulated broad discussion of these issues include ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'' (1985), by [[Greg Bear]]; ''[[Lilith's Brood|The Xenogenesis Trilogy]]'' (1987–1989), by [[Octavia Butler]]; ''[[Beggars in Spain|The Beggar's Trilogy]]'' (1990–94), by [[Nancy Kress]]; much of [[Greg Egan]]'s work since the early 1990s such as ''[[Permutation City]]'' (1994) and ''[[Diaspora (novel)|Diaspora]]'' (1997); The [[Culture series]] of Iain M. Banks; ''The Bohr Maker'' (1995), by [[Linda Nagata]]; ''[[Altered Carbon]]'' (2002), by Richard K. Morgan; ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' (2003), by [[Margaret Atwood]]; ''[[The Elementary Particles]]'' (Eng. trans. 2001) and ''[[The Possibility of an Island]]'' (Eng. trans. 2006), by [[Michel Houellebecq]]; ''Mindscan'' (2005), by [[Robert J. Sawyer]]; the ''[[Commonwealth Saga]]'' (2002–10), by [[Peter F. Hamilton]]; and ''[[Glasshouse (novel)|Glasshouse]]'' (2005), by [[Charles Stross]]. Some of these works are considered part of the cyberpunk genre or its [[postcyberpunk]] offshoot.

[[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[Inferno (Dan Brown novel)|Inferno]]'' focuses on the theme of transhumanism. In an interview with ''Today'', Dan Brown said "Transhumanism is the ethics and science of using things like biological and genetic engineering to transform our bodies and make us a more powerful species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/dan-brown-inferno-i-just-spent-3-years-hell-1C9909476|title=Dan Brown on 'Inferno': 'I just spent 3 years in hell'|work=Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictional transhumanist scenarios have also become popular in other media during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Such treatments are found in [[comic book]]s (''[[Captain America]]'', 1941; ''[[Iron Man]]'' 1963; ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'', 1997; ''[[The Surrogates]]'', 2006), [[film]]s (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', 1968; ''[[Blade Runner]]'', 1982; ''[[Gattaca]]'', 1997, ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'', 2015), [[television series]] (the [[Cybermen]] of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', 1966; the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', 1989, ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', 2003, ''[[Black Mirror]]'', 2011), [[manga]] and [[anime]] (''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'', 1978; ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'', 1985; ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', 1989; ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', 1995; and the ''[[Gundam]]'' metaseries, 1979), [[video game]]s (''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', 1998; ''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]'', 1999; ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', 2000; ''[[EVE Online]]'', 2003; ''[[BioShock]]'', 2007; ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', 2004; ''[[Crysis]]'', 2007; ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]''; 2011;&lt;ref name="montrealmirror"/&gt; ''[[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided]]'', 2016) and [[role-playing game]]s.

Carnal Art, a form of [[sculpture]] originated by French artist [[Orlan]], uses the body as its medium and [[plastic surgery]] as its method.&lt;ref name="O'Bryan 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = O'Bryan, C. Jill| title = Carnal Art:Orlan's Refacing| publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]]| year = 2005| isbn = 0-8166-4322-9| oclc = 56755659}}&lt;/ref&gt; French biological anthropologist Dr. Judith Nicogossian also works on representations of the hybrid body.

== Debate{{anchor|Controversy}} ==
The very notion and prospect of human enhancement and related issues arouse public controversy.&lt;ref name="Garreau 2006"/&gt; Criticisms of transhumanism and its proposals take two main forms: those objecting to the likelihood of transhumanist goals being achieved (practical criticisms) and those objecting to the moral principles or worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying transhumanism itself (ethical criticisms). Critics and opponents often see transhumanists' goals as posing threats to [[humanism|human values]].

Some of the most widely known critiques of the transhumanist program are novels and fictional films. These works of art, despite presenting imagined worlds rather than philosophical analyses, are used as touchstones for some of the more formal arguments.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; Various arguments have been made to the effect that a society that adopts human enhancement technologies may come to resemble the [[dystopia]] depicted in the 1932 novel ''[[Brave New World]], ''by [[Aldous Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UVRim2WvW50C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Various+arguments+have+been+made+to+the+effect+that+a+society+that+adopts+human+enhancement+technologies+may+come+to+resemble+the+dystopia+depicted+in+the+1932+novel+Brave+New+World,+by+Aldous+Huxley&amp;ots=g4onz4Zzf7&amp;sig=mgG6-iJrLCD-5YnRaI_Dc2JsKj0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution|last=Fukuyama|first=Francis|date=2003-05-01|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=9780374706180|location=|pages=7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another front, some authors consider that humanity would already be transhuman, because medical advances in recent centuries have significantly altered our species. However, it would not be in a conscious and therefore transhumanistic way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casas|first1=Miquel|title=El fin del Homo sapiens: La naturaleza y el transhumanismo|date=2017|page= 112| publisher=2017|location=Madrid|isbn=9788416996353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feasibility ===
In a 1992 book, sociologist Max Dublin pointed to many past failed predictions of technological progress and argued that modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate. He also objected to what he saw as [[scientism]], fanaticism and [[nihilism]] by a few in advancing transhumanist causes. Dublin also said that historical parallels existed between [[Millenarianism|Millenarian]] religions and [[Historical materialism|Communist doctrines]].&lt;ref name="Dublin 1992"/&gt;

Although generally sympathetic to transhumanism, public health professor [[Gregory Stock]] is skeptical of the technical feasibility and mass appeal of the [[cyborgization]] of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil, [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Kevin Warwick]]. He said that, throughout the 21st century, many humans would find themselves deeply integrated into systems of machines, but would remain biological. Primary changes to their own form and character would arise not from [[cyberware]], but from the direct manipulation of their [[genetics]], [[metabolism]] and [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Stock 2002"/&gt;

In her 1992 book ''Science as Salvation'', philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] traces the notion of achieving immortality by [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] of the material human body (echoed in the transhumanist tenet of [[mind uploading]]) to a group of male scientific thinkers of the early 20th century, including [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and members of his circle. She characterizes these ideas as "quasi-scientific dreams and prophesies" involving [[Escapism|visions of escape]] from the body coupled with "self-indulgent, uncontrolled power-fantasies". Her argument focuses on what she perceives as the [[pseudoscientific]] speculations and irrational, fear-of-death-driven fantasies of these thinkers, their disregard for [[layman|laymen]] and the remoteness of their [[eschatological]] visions.&lt;ref name="Midgley 1992"/&gt;

Another critique is aimed mainly at "[[algeny]]" (a portmanteau of ''alchemy'' and ''genetics''), which [[Jeremy Rifkin]] defined as "the upgrading of existing organisms and the design of wholly new ones with the intent of 'perfecting' their performance".&lt;ref name="Rifkin 1983"/&gt; It emphasizes the issue of [[biocomplexity]] and the unpredictability of attempts to guide the development of products of biological [[evolution]]. This argument, elaborated in particular by the biologist [[Stuart Newman]], is based on the recognition that [[somatic cell nuclear transfer|cloning]] and [[germline]] [[genetic engineering]] of animals are error-prone and inherently disruptive of embryonic [[morphogenesis|development]]. Accordingly, so it is argued, it would create unacceptable risks to use such methods on human embryos. Performing experiments, particularly ones with permanent biological consequences, on developing humans would thus be in violation of accepted principles governing research on human subjects (see the 1964 [[Declaration of Helsinki]]). Moreover, because improvements in experimental outcomes in one species are not automatically transferable to a new species without further experimentation, it is claimed that there is no ethical route to genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages.&lt;ref name="Newman 2003"/&gt;

As a practical matter, however, international protocols on human subject research may not present a legal obstacle to attempts by transhumanists and others to improve their offspring by germinal choice technology. According to legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky, existing laws would protect parents who choose to enhance their child's genome from future liability arising from adverse outcomes of the procedure.&lt;ref name="Smolensky 2006"/&gt;

Transhumanists and other supporters of human genetic engineering do not dismiss practical concerns out of hand, insofar as there is a high degree of uncertainty about the timelines and likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans. However, [[bioethicist]] [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] suggests that one possible ethical route to the genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages is the building of [[computer model]]s of the [[human genome]], the proteins it specifies and the [[tissue engineering]] he argues that it also codes for. With the exponential progress in [[bioinformatics]], Hughes believes that a virtual model of genetic expression in the human body will not be far behind and that it will soon be possible to accelerate approval of genetic modifications by simulating their effects on virtual humans.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; [[Public health]] professor [[Gregory Stock]] points to [[Human artificial chromosome|artificial chromosomes]] as an alleged safer alternative to existing genetic engineering techniques.&lt;ref name = "Stock 2002"/&gt;

Thinkers{{who|date=October 2014}} who defend the likelihood of [[accelerating change]] point to a past pattern of exponential increases in humanity's technological capacities. Kurzweil developed this position in his 2005 book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

=== Intrinsic immorality ===
It has been argued that, in transhumanist thought, humans attempt to substitute themselves for [[God]]. The 2002 [[Holy See|Vatican]] statement ''Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God,''&lt;ref name="International Theological Commission 2002"/&gt; stated that "changing the genetic identity of man as a human person through the production of an [[infrahuman]] being is radically immoral", implying, that "man has full right of disposal over his own biological nature". The statement also argues that creation of a superhuman or spiritually superior being is "unthinkable", since true improvement can come only through religious experience and "[[Divinization (Christian)|realizing more fully the image of God]]". Christian theologians and lay activists of several churches and denominations have expressed similar objections to transhumanism and claimed that Christians attain in the afterlife what radical transhumanism promises, such as indefinite [[life extension]] or the abolition of suffering. In this view, transhumanism is just another representative of the long line of [[utopian]] movements which seek to [[immanentize the eschaton|create "heaven on earth"]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell &amp; Kilner 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barratt 2006"/&gt; On the other hand, religious thinkers allied with transhumanist goals such as the theologians Ronald Cole-Turner and [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] hold that the doctrine of "co-creation" provides an obligation to use genetic engineering to improve human biology.&lt;ref name="Cole-Turner 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters 1997"/&gt;

Other critics target what they claim to be an instrumental conception of the human body in the writings of Marvin Minsky, [[Hans Moravec]] and some other transhumanists.&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999"/&gt; Reflecting a strain of [[feminism|feminist]] criticism of the transhumanist program, philosopher [[Susan Bordo]] points to "contemporary [[Body image|obsessions with slenderness, youth and physical perfection]]", which she sees as affecting both men and women, but in distinct ways, as "the logical (if extreme) manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture."&lt;ref name="Bordo 1993"/&gt; Some critics question other social implications of the movement's focus on [[body modification]]. Political scientist Klaus-Gerd Giesen, in particular, has asserted that transhumanism's concentration on altering the human body represents the logical yet tragic consequence of [[atomized individualism]] and body [[commodification]] within a [[consumer culture]].&lt;ref name="Giesen 2004"/&gt;

Nick Bostrom responds that the desire to [[rejuvenation (aging)|regain youth]], specifically, and transcend the natural limitations of the human body, in general, is pan-cultural and pan-historical, and is therefore not uniquely tied to the culture of the 20th century. He argues that the transhumanist program is an attempt to channel that desire into a scientific project on par with the [[Human Genome Project]] and achieve humanity's oldest hope, rather than a puerile fantasy or social trend.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

=== Loss of human identity ===
[[File:Amish vs modern transportation.jpg|thumb|In the U.S., the [[Amish]] are a religious group probably most known for their avoidance of certain modern technologies. Transhumanists draw a parallel by arguing that in the near-future there will probably be "humanish", people who choose to "stay human" by not adopting human enhancement technologies. They believe their choice must be respected and protected.&lt;ref name="Alexander 2000"/&gt;]]

In his 2003 book ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age'', [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]] argued at length against many of the technologies that are postulated or supported by transhumanists, including [[germinal choice technology]], [[nanomedicine]] and [[life extension]] strategies. He claims that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to [[aging]], [[maximum life span]] and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to "improve" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] in a world where such limitations could be overcome technologically. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]] and the contemporary [[Amish]].&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"/&gt;

[[Biopolitical]] activist [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and biologist [[Stuart Newman]] accept that biotechnology has the power to make profound changes in [[organism]]al identity. They argue against the genetic engineering of human beings because they fear the blurring of the boundary between human and [[Cultural artifact|artifact]].&lt;ref name="Newman 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Otchet 1998"/&gt; Philosopher Keekok Lee sees such developments as part of an accelerating trend in [[modernization]] in which technology has been used to transform the "natural" into the "artefactual".&lt;ref name="Lee 1999"/&gt; In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of "[[monster]]s" such as [[human clone]]s, [[human-animal hybrid|human-animal]] [[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]], or [[bioroid]]s, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from [[social structure|social]] and [[ecosystem|ecological]] systems are seen as problematic. The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and the novels ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys From Brazil]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'' (1896) depict elements of such scenarios, but Mary Shelley's 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is most often alluded to by critics who suggest that biotechnologies could create [[objectification|objectified]] and [[anomie|socially unmoored]] people as well as [[untermensch|subhumans]]. Such critics propose that strict measures be implemented to prevent what they portray as [[dehumanization|dehumanizing]] possibilities from ever happening, usually in the form of an international [[ban (law)|ban]] on human genetic engineering.&lt;ref name="Darnovsky Crossroads"/&gt;

[[Science journalist]] [[Ronald Bailey]] claims that McKibben's historical examples are flawed and support different conclusions when studied more closely.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2003"/&gt; For example, few groups are more cautious than the Amish about embracing new technologies, but, though they shun television and use horses and buggies, some are welcoming the possibilities of [[gene therapy]] since inbreeding has afflicted them with a number of rare genetic diseases.&lt;ref name="Stock 2002"/&gt; Bailey and other supporters of technological alteration of human biology also reject the claim that life would be experienced as meaningless if some human limitations are overcome with [[enhancement technologies]] as extremely subjective.

Writing in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, Bailey has accused opponents of research involving the modification of animals as indulging in [[alarmism]] when they speculate about the creation of subhuman creatures with human-like intelligence and brains resembling those of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Bailey insists that the aim of conducting research on animals is simply to produce human [[health care]] benefits.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2001"/&gt;

A different response comes from transhumanist [[personhood theory|personhood theorists]] who object to what they characterize as the anthropomorphobia fueling some criticisms of this research, which science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]] termed the "[[Frankenstein complex]]". For example, [[Woody Evans]] argues that, provided they are [[self-aware]], human clones, human-animal chimeras and [[biological uplift|uplifted animals]] would all be unique persons deserving of respect, dignity, rights, responsibilities, and [[citizenship]].&lt;ref Name="Evans 2015"/&gt; They conclude that the coming ethical issue is not the creation of so-called monsters, but what they characterize as the "[[wisdom of repugnance|yuck factor]]" and "[[Human exceptionalism|human-racism]]", that would judge and treat these creations as monstrous.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn 2003"/&gt;

At least one [[public interest]] organization, the U.S.-based [[Center for Genetics and Society]], was formed, in 2001, with the specific goal of opposing transhumanist agendas that involve transgenerational modification of human biology, such as full-term [[human cloning]] and [[germinal choice technology]]. The [[Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future]] of the [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]] critically scrutinizes proposed applications of genetic and nanotechnologies to human biology in an academic setting.

=== Socioeconomic effects{{anchor|Genetic divide}} ===
Some critics of [[libertarian transhumanism]] have focused on the likely socioeconomic consequences in societies in which [[economic inequality|divisions between rich and poor]] are on the rise. [[Bill McKibben]], for example, suggests that emerging human enhancement technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources, thereby exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and creating a "genetic divide".&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"/&gt; Even [[Lee M. Silver]], the biologist and [[science writer]] who coined the term "[[reprogenetics]]" and supports its applications, has expressed concern that these methods could create a two-tiered society of genetically engineered "haves" and "have nots" if [[social safety net|social democratic reforms]] lag behind implementation of enhancement technologies.&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"/&gt; The 1997 film ''[[Gattaca]]'' depicts a [[dystopia]]n society in which one's [[social class]] depends entirely on genetic modifications and is often cited by critics in support of these views.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

These criticisms are also voiced by [[criticism of libertarianism|non-libertarian]] transhumanist advocates, especially self-described [[democratic transhumanist]]s, who believe that the majority of current or future [[social issues|social]] and [[environmental issues]] (such as [[unemployment]] and [[resource depletion]]) need to be addressed by a combination of political and technological solutions (like a [[guaranteed minimum income]] and [[alternative technology]]). Therefore, on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies, bioethicist James Hughes, in his 2004 book ''[[Citizen Cyborg|Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future]]'', argues that [[progressivism|progressives]] or, more precisely, [[techno-progressive]]s must articulate and implement public policies (i.e., a [[universal health care]] [[voucher]] system that covers human enhancement technologies) in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible, rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies. The latter, he argues, might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local [[black market]] or in countries where such a ban is not enforced.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Sometimes, as in the writings of [[Leon Kass]], the fear is that various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref name="Kass 2001"/&gt; In his 2002 book ''[[Our Posthuman Future]]'' and in a 2004 ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine article, political economist and philosopher [[Francis Fukuyama]] designates transhumanism as the [[world's most dangerous idea]] because he believes that it may undermine the egalitarian ideals of [[democracy]] (in general) and [[liberal democracy]] (in particular) through a fundamental alteration of "[[human nature]]".&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2004"/&gt; Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] makes a similar argument in his 2003 book ''The Future of Human Nature'', in which he asserts that moral autonomy depends on not being subject to another's unilaterally imposed specifications. Habermas thus suggests that the human "species ethic" would be undermined by embryo-stage genetic alteration.&lt;ref name="Habermas 2004"/&gt; Critics such as Kass, Fukuyama and a variety of authors hold that attempts to significantly alter human biology are not only inherently immoral, but also threaten the [[social order]]. Alternatively, they argue that implementation of such technologies would likely lead to the "naturalizing" of [[social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] or place new means of [[social control|control]] in the hands of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes. [[AI]] pioneer [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] criticizes what he sees as [[misanthropic]] tendencies in the language and ideas of some of his colleagues, in particular Marvin Minsky and [[Hans Moravec]], which, by devaluing the human organism per se, promotes a discourse that enables divisive and undemocratic social policies.&lt;ref name="Platt 1995"/&gt;

In a 2004 article in the libertarian monthly ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]],'' science journalist [[Ronald Bailey]] contested the assertions of Fukuyama by arguing that political equality has never rested on the facts of human biology. He asserts that [[liberalism]] was founded not on the proposition of effective equality of human beings, or ''de facto'' equality, but on the assertion of an equality in political rights and before the law, or ''de jure'' equality. Bailey asserts that the products of genetic engineering may well ameliorate rather than exacerbate human inequality, giving to the many what were once the privileges of the few. Moreover, he argues, "the crowning achievement of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is the principle of [[Toleration|tolerance]]". In fact, he says, political liberalism is already the solution to the issue of human and [[posthuman]] rights since in liberal societies the law is meant to apply equally to all, no matter how rich or poor, powerful or powerless, educated or ignorant, enhanced or unenhanced.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2004"/&gt; Other thinkers who are sympathetic to transhumanist ideas, such as philosopher [[Russell Blackford]], have also objected to the appeal to [[traditional values|tradition]] and what they see as [[alarmism]] involved in ''Brave New World''-type arguments.&lt;ref name="Blackford 2003"/&gt;

=== Specter of coercive eugenicism ===
Some critics of transhumanism see the old [[eugenics]], [[social Darwinist]], and [[master race]] ideologies and programs of the past as warnings of what the promotion of eugenic enhancement technologies might unintentionally encourage. Some fear future "[[Biopolitics|eugenics wars]]" as the worst-case scenario: the return of coercive state-sponsored [[genetic discrimination]] and [[Human rights violations#Human rights violations|human rights violations]] such as [[compulsory sterilization]] of persons with genetic defects, the killing of the institutionalized and, specifically, [[racial segregation|segregation]] and [[genocide]] of [[Social interpretations of race|''races'']]'' ''perceived as inferior.&lt;ref name="Black 2003"/&gt; Health law professor [[George Annas]] and technology law professor [[Lori Andrews]] are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-[[posthuman]] [[caste]] warfare.&lt;ref name="Darnovsky Crossroads"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Annas 2002"/&gt;

The major transhumanist organizations strongly condemn the [[coercion]] involved in such policies and reject the [[scientific racism|racist]] and [[classist]] assumptions on which they were based, along with the [[pseudoscientific]] notions that eugenic improvements could be accomplished in a practically meaningful time frame through selective human breeding.&lt;ref name="Bashford545"&gt;{{cite book | title= The Oxford Handbook of The History of Eugenics | author= [[Bashford, A.]] and [[Levine, P.]] | page= 545| publisher = Oxford University Press | year= 2010 | isbn= 9780195373141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, most transhumanist thinkers advocate a "new eugenics", a form of [[egalitarian]] [[liberal eugenics]].&lt;ref name="WTA FAQ 3.2"/&gt; In their 2000 book ''From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice'', non-transhumanist bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler have argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' [[reproductive rights]] or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize [[public health]] and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.&lt;ref name="Buchanan 2000"/&gt; Most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term "eugenics" (preferring "[[germinal choice]]" or "[[reprogenetics]]")&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"/&gt; to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early-20th-century eugenic movements.

=== Existential risks ===
{{see also|Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence}}
In his 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', British [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Martin Rees]] argues that advanced science and technology bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress. However, Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity. Instead, he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness.&lt;ref name="Rees 2003"/&gt; Advocates of the [[precautionary principle]], such as many in the [[environmental movement]], also favor slow, careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas. Some precautionists believe that [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life.&lt;ref name="Arnall 2003"/&gt;

Transhumanists do not necessarily rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of [[existential risk]]. Generally, however, they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often [[technorealism|unrealistic]] and sometimes even counter-productive as opposed to the [[technogaian]] current of transhumanism, which they claim is both realistic and productive. In his television series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'', [[science historian]] [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] dissects several views on [[technological change]], including precautionism and the restriction of [[inquiry|open inquiry]]. Burke questions the practicality of some of these views, but concludes that maintaining the ''[[status quo]]'' of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own, such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet's resources. The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]], rather than fostering what it considers to be [[anti-science|anti-scientific views]] and [[technophobia]].

[[Nick Bostrom]] argues that even barring the occurrence of a singular [[Global catastrophic risk|global catastrophic event]], basic [[Malthusian]] and evolutionary forces facilitated by technological progress threaten to eliminate the positive aspects of human society.&lt;ref name="bostrom-evolution"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=The Future of Human Evolution|journal=Bedeutung|volume=284|issue=3|pages=8|date=2009|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html|bibcode=2001SciAm.284c...8R|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0301-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One transhumanist solution proposed by Bostrom to counter existential risks is control of [[differential technological development]], a series of attempts to influence the sequence in which technologies are developed. In this approach, planners would strive to retard the development of possibly harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of likely beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful effects of others.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"/&gt;

===Authenticity of transhuman goals===
Lara Prendergast has stated that goals of transhumanism, such as trying to cut out food and sex, are inauthentic, because doing so would remove two of the great joys of life. She called transhumanism a part of 'the new narcissism'. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/08/why-are-modern-men-obsessed-with-self-improvement/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vitalij Aab''' (born November 14, 1979, in [[Karaganda]], [[Soviet Union]]) is a German [[ice hockey]] player who is currently an [[Unrestricted Free Agent]]. He most recently played for the [[Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers]] in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icetigers.de/ICETIGERS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=518:vitalij-aab-kehrt-nach-nuernberg-zurueck&amp;catid=1:aktuelle-nachrichten&amp;Itemid=76|title=Vitalij Aab returns to Nürnberg|publisher=Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers|language=German|date=2010-05-11|accessdate=2010-05-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226201047/http://www.icetigers.de/ICETIGERS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=518:vitalij-aab-kehrt-nach-nuernberg-zurueck&amp;catid=1:aktuelle-nachrichten&amp;Itemid=76|archivedate=2010-12-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
Vitalij Aab's professional debut was at the age of 17 for EC Wilhelmshaven. In his second season, he scored 28 points. In 1999, he was promoted into the second division with Wilhelmshaven. Two years later, he transferred to the [[Nuremberg Ice Tigers]], where he played for three years. During this time he played so well that the German national coach called him up to play for the [[Germany men's national ice hockey team|German national ice hockey team]]. Aab had the worst season of his career in 2004–05 with the [[Adler Mannheim]]; he only scored 24 points in 48 games, and therefore received very little ice time at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeyweb.de/static/spielerportraits/aab_vitalij.htm|title=Vitalij Aab profile|website=Hockeyweb.de|date=2010-05-11|accessdate=2010-05-11|language=German|archivedate=2007-12-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219224955/http://www.hockeyweb.de/static/spielerportraits/aab_vitalij.htm|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He left Mannheim after only one season and switched to the [[Iserlohn Roosters]]. After struggling at first, Aab's performance improved dramatically. At the end of the season, he was the highest scorer in Germany. Before the 2006–07 season, he signed with the [[Hamburg Freezers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=German|website=abendblatt.de|date=2006-05-09 |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2008/09/26/943403.html|title=Vitalij Aab: Forward joins the Freezers|accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
