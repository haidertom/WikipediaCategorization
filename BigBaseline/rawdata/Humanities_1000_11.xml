      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2196">An '''adaptation''' is a transfer of a work of art from one medium to another.

Some common examples are:
* [[Film adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[film]] (it may be a novel, non-fiction like journalism, autobiography, comic books, scriptures, plays or historical sources)
* [[Literary adaptation]], a story from a literary source, adapted into another work{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* [[Theatrical adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[play (theatre)|play]]

There is, however, no end to potential media involved in adaptation. Adaptation is the practice of transcoding (changing the code or 'language' used in a medium) as well as the assimilation of a work of art to other cultural, linguistic, semiotic, aesthetic or other norms. Recent approaches to the expanding field Adaptation Studies reflect these expansion of our perspective. Adaptation occurs as a special case of intertextual and intermedial exchange and the copy-paste culture of digital technologies has produced "new intertextual forms engendered by emerging technologies—mashups, remixes, reboots, samplings, remodelings, transformations— " that "further develop the impulse to adapt and appropriate, and the ways in which they challenge the theory and practice of adaptation and appropriation."&lt;ref&gt;Voigts, Eckart. "Memes and Recombinant Appropriation: Remix, Mashup, Parody" in Thomas Leitch (ed.) ''Oxford Handbook of Adaptation Studies.'' Oxford: OUP, 2017. http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199331000.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199331000-e-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement predominantly centered around Paris, France, and Italy, with some offshoots in England, Germany, and North America.

Some examples of animalier artists and their subjects are [[George Stubbs]] and [[Jules Moigniez]] (paintings and sculpture of horses), [[Antoine Barye|Antoine-Louis Barye]] (sculpture of bulls and humans), and [[Rembrandt Bugatti]] (felines, human figures, and zoo animals).

== History ==
[[File:Theseus Slaying Minotaur by Barye.jpg|thumb|left|''Theseus Slaying Minotaur'' by Barye]] Animals as a [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motif]] were used in [[ancient art]] and in [[tribal art]], in [[animal style]] art and objects but were not generally represented as figurative, anatomically correct, creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=H.W.|title=History of art : a survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day|date=1986|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1094-2|pages=81–82|edition=3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Germanic culture|Germanic]] animal style with its "combination of abstract and organic shapes, of formal discipline and imaginative freedom, became an important element ... in the art of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=H.W.|last2=Janson|first2=Anthony F.|title=History of art : a survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day|date=1986|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1094-2|pages=255–256|edition=3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Baroque]] period in France and England, a 1670 commissioned [[terracotta]] model for a sculpture of [[Louis XIV]] titled ''Equestrian Statue of Louis XIV'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] was rejected on the grounds that it was not suitable to the dignity of the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=H.W.|title=History of art: a survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day|date=1986|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1094-2|pages=553–554|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term animalier was first used by the French press and [[Salon (Paris)|salon]] jurors, often as a derogatory term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallery|first1=The Bronze|title=Les Animaliers - The 19th century French movement of Bronze Sculpture|url=http://bronze-gallery.com/info/info.cfm?infoID=9|website=bronze-gallery.com|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris salon thought animal subjects too common for fine art, but with the opening of the new [[Jardin des Plantes|Paris Jardin des Plantes]] zoo and the [[Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes]], interest in animal art increased.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Dukes of [[Duke of Orléans|Orleans]], [[Duke of Luynes|Luynes]], [[Duke of Montpensier|Montpensier]], and [[Duke of Nemours|Nemours]] were soon to become Barye's patrons. In 1882 [[Edouard Manet]] created a portrait in pastel on canvas of the animalier artist Julien de La Rochenoire, which has been owned by the [[Getty Museum]] since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/265936/edouard-manet-portrait-of-julien-de-la-rochenoire-french-1882/&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project]] The art of George Stubbs became a favorite of collector [[Paul Mellon]], who donated many of Stubbs' paintings to the [[Yale Center for British Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maj|first1=Yale Center for British Art, Lec|title=Zebra|url=http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/1669240|website=collections.britishart.yale.edu|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "many animal sculptures were modeled in plaster for exhibition and cast later in bronze editions. The size and variety of an edition depended on the popularity of the piece at exhibition, and many Barye, Mêne, and Fratin pieces were so popular that they were cast in very large editions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Metz Collection|url=http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html|website=www.iub.edu|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animalier artists ==
[[File:Rembrandt bugatti zoo antwerpen 1910.jpg|thumb|left|Rembrandt Bugatti at the zoo in Antwerp, Belgium]]Artists of the animalier movement were referred to as ''[[les animaliers]]''. Important artists of the animalier movement included [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] (1796–1875), [[Rembrandt Bugatti]] (1884–1916), [[George Stubbs]] (1724–1806), [[Alfred Dedreux]] (1810–1860), [[Christopher Fratin]] (1801–1864),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bronze-gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=21

== Animalier reproductions ==
Many beautiful [[replicas]] are made of animalier sculpture, which may be cast or molded in any size and of any material. The most desirable of these are exact in detail and made from the same material, such as [[cast iron]], [[spelter]], or [[cast bronze]], as used in the artist's original sculpture. Most of the original animalier sculptors used the traditional [[lost wax]] process of casting prevalent at the time. Alexandre Guionnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auguste Cain.

Modern reproductions of the original sculptures frequently use [[patinated]] [[verdigris]] cast bronze or iron, or [[Resin casting|bonded marble resin]] (pulverized reconstituted marble combined with resin glue), as well as various other materials and techniques, such as a composite of [[Capiz]] [[placuna placenta]] oyster shells, also known as window oyster shells, which come primarily from the [[Philippines]] (where they are known as ''kapiz'').{{clear}}

'''Apolista''' is a native [[South America]]n nation of western [[Bolivia]]. Sedentary farmers, hunters, gatherers and fishers, they spoke an [[Arawakan languages]] now [[List of endangered languages in South America|gravely endangered]], if not extinct. From 1713, they were gathered at a variety of missions with other nations, and rapidly lost their traditional culture to the point that a realistic census count is no longer possible.

'''Arabic calligraphy''' is the artistic practice of [[penmanship|handwriting]] and [[calligraphy]]&lt;!-- and by extension, [[bookbinding|bookmaking]],--&gt; based on the [[Arabic alphabet]].  It is known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''khatt'' ({{lang-ar|خط}}), derived from the word 'line', 'design', or 'construction'.&lt;ref name=typography&gt;{{cite web| title=Arabic calligraphy as a typographic exercise| url=http://ilovetypography.com/2008/07/10/arabic-calligraphy-as-a-typographic-exercise/ |author=Julia Kaestle |date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Widany2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefan Widany|title=The History of Arabic Calligraphy - an Essay on Its Greatest Artists and Its Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0Wyt3dh5rYC|date=June 2011|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-93875-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Kufic]] is the oldest form of the [[Arabic script]].

Although most [[Islamic calligraphy]] is in Arabic and most Arabic calligraphy is Islamic, the two are not identical. [[Coptic Christian]] manuscripts in Arabic, for example, may make use of calligraphy. Likewise, there is Islamic [[Persian calligraphy|calligraphy in Persian]].

'''Arvind Sharma''' is the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at [[McGill University]]. Sharma's works focus on [[comparative religion]], [[Hinduism]], [[philosophy of religion]] and the role of women in religion. Some of his more widely read works include ''Our Religions'' and ''Women in World Religions'', which were edited by him. ''Feminism in World Religions'' was selected as a [[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] Outstanding Academic Book (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.emory.edu/HSC/sharma.html Dr. Arvind Sharma], Emory University Hindu Students Council, retrieved 2015-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography== 
Arvind Sharma was born on the 13th of January 1940 in [[Varanasi]], [[India]] . Raised in a family that traditionally worked in the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), he followed suit and joined the IAS in 1962 after a distinguished academic career. 

He served in the State of Gujarat until 1968, when he moved to the United States to pursue higher studies in economics at the [[University of Syracuse]], obtaining a Masters in economics in 1970.  While pursuing the role of non-economic factors in economic development he became interested in religion and joined Harvard Divinity School in 1972.  After obtaining a Masters in Theological Studies, concentrating on comparative religion, he earned his PhD from the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies in 1978.  His doctorate work involved the first ever translation in English of Abhinavagupta's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.

While at Harvard he was recruited in 1976 by the newly founded Department of Studies in Religion at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. In 1980 he moved to the University of Sydney, from where he was hired by McGill University in Canada in 1987.  In 1994 he was appointed the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at McGill University, where he continues to teach as of 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12558">'''Biocultural anthropology''' can be defined in numerous ways. It is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and [[culture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~kelso/Biologicalanth.html|title=Principles of Biocultural Anthropology|website=spot.colorado.edu|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Instead of looking for the biology underlying biological roots of human behavior, biocultural anthropology attempts to understand how culture affects our biological capacities and limitations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Biocult_syn"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Goodman |editor-first=Alan H. |editor2=Thomas L.

The shift towards understanding the role of culture to human biology led to the development of [[Dual inheritance theory]] in the 1960s. In relation to, and following the development of Dual-inheritance theory, [[biocultural evolution]] was introduced and first used in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bioculturalevolution.net/biocultural-overview/|title=Biocultural Evolution–An Overview|date=2013-05-22|newspaper=The Biocultural Evolution Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Biocultural approaches to [[human biology]] have been utilized since at least 1958 when American Biological Anthropologist [[Frank B.

* Human adaptability research in the 1960s focused on two biocultural approaches to fatigue: functional differentiation of skeletal muscles associated with various movements, and human adaptability to modern living involving different work types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S5nSgzf2MhQC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=human+adaptability+studies+1960's&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8mNau7cNgW&amp;sig=wbHaOIkIWG1ogKUQCOd5VSU-eV0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip-Zy8y4HRAhWGg1QKHXZZDIwQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=human%20adaptability%20studies%201960's&amp;f=false|title=Human Variation: From the Laboratory to the Field|last=Mascie-Taylor|first=C.

* "What's Cultural about Biocultural Research," Written by William W. Dressler, connects the cultural perspective of biocultural anthropology to "cultural consonance" which is defined as "a model to assess the approximation of an individuals behavior compared to the guiding awareness of his or her culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medanth.wikispaces.com/Cultural+Consonance|title=medanth - Cultural Consonance|website=medanth.wikispaces.com|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research has been used to examine outcomes in blood pressure, depressive symptoms, body composition, and dietary habits.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Contemporary biocultural anthropology ==
Biocultural methods focus on the interactions between humans and their environment to understand human biological [[adaptation]] and [[Human genetic variation|variation]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0095.xml|title=Biocultural Anthropology - Anthropology - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary biocultural anthropologists view culture as having several key roles in human biological variation:
* Culture is a major human adaptation, permitting individuals and populations to adapt to widely varying local [[ecologies]].
* Characteristic human biological or biobehavioral features, such as a large [[frontal cortex]] and intensive [[parenting]] compared to other primates, are viewed in part as an [[adaptation]] to the complex social relations created by culture.&lt;ref name=Geary_Flinn&gt;{{cite journal

* Culture shapes the [[political economy]], thereby influencing what resources are available to individuals to feed and shelter themselves, protect themselves from disease, and otherwise maintain their health.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn /&gt;
* Culture shapes the way people think about the world, altering their biology by influencing their behavior (e.g., food choice) or more directly through [[psychosomatic]] effects (e.g., the biological effects of [[Stress (medicine)|psychological stress]]).&lt;ref name=Hruschka_et_al&gt;{{cite journal

While biocultural anthropologists are found in many academic anthropology departments, usually as a minority of the faculty, certain departments have placed considerable emphasis on the "biocultural synthesis".  Historically, this has included [[Emory University]], the [[University of Alabama]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]] (especially in biocultural [[bioarchaeology]]) [http://www.umass.edu/bioarchaeology] [https://web.archive.org/web/20141030031504/http://www.umass.edu/anthro/faculty/permanent.html], and the [[University of Washington]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20090415073607/http://depts.washington.edu/anthweb/programs/biocultural.php], each of which built [[Ph.D.]] programs around biocultural anthropology; [[Binghamton University]], which has a [[Master of Science|M.S.]] program in biomedical anthropology; [[Oregon State University]], University of Kentucky and others. [[Paul T. Baker|Paul Baker]], an anthropologist at [[Penn State]] whose work focused upon human adaptation to environmental variations, is credited with having popularized the concept of "biocultural" anthropology as a distinct subcategory of [[anthropology]] in general.&lt;ref name=Bindon&gt;{{cite journal

== Controversy == 
{{unclear|section|date=February 2018}}
Other anthropologists, both [[biological anthropology|biological]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], have criticized the biocultural synthesis, generally as part of a broader critique of "[[four-field holism]]" in U.S. anthropology (see [[anthropology]] main article).  Typically such criticisms rest on the belief that biocultural anthropology imposes holism upon the biological and cultural subfields without adding value, or even destructively.  For instance, contributors in the edited volume ''Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology''&lt;ref name=Sacred_bundle&gt;{{cite book |last=[http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/%7Edsegal/ Segal] |first=Daniel A. |editors=Sylvia J. Yanagisako, James Clifford, Ian Hodder, Rena Lederman, Michael Silverstein |title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2005 |url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/cgibin/forwardsql/search.cgi?template0=nomatch.htm&amp;template2=books/book_detail_page.htm&amp;user_id=11016434335&amp;Bmain.Btitle_option=1&amp;Bmain.Btitle=Unwrapping+the+Sacred+Bundle }} introduction: [http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/%7Edsegal/theory/yanasegal.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809023306/http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/~dsegal/theory/yanasegal.pdf |date=2007-08-09 }} reviews: [http://www.anthrosource.net/doi/abs/10.1525/jlat.2006.11.1.235] [http://www.anthrosource.net/doi/abs/10.1525/an.2006.47.1.8.2?journalCode=an] [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9655.2006.00372_39.x] [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/anthropological_quarterly/v078/78.4song.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the biocultural synthesis, and anthropological holism more generally, are artifacts from 19th century [[sociocultural evolution|social evolutionary]] thought that inappropriately impose scientific [[positivism]] upon [[cultural anthropology]].

Some departments of anthropology have fully split, usually dividing [[scientific]] from humanistic anthropologists, such as [[Stanford|Stanford's]] highly publicized 1998 division into departments of "Cultural and Social Anthropology" and "Anthropological Sciences".  Underscoring the continuing controversy, this split is now being reversed over the objections of some faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2007/february14/anthsci-021407.html Anthropology departments instructed to form combined unit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other departments, such as at [[Harvard]], have distinct biological and sociocultural anthropology "wings" not designed to foster cross subdisciplinary interchange.

Biocultural approaches were derived from [[biology]] and science yet social theorists {{who|date=February 2018}} are feeling encroached upon.{{weasel-inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; {{deadlink|date=February 2018}} The Biocultural approach has also not been a central concern to anthropologists {{dubious|date=February 2018}} which is a contributor to the splitting of the approach into [[sociocultural anthropology]] and biosocial anthropology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biocult_syn" /&gt; Biocultural research has shown to contain a few challenges to the researcher.  "In general we are much more experienced in measuring the biological than the cultural. It is also difficult to precisely define what is meant by constructs such as socioeconomic status, poverty, rural, and urban. Operationalizing key variables so that they can be measured in ways that are enthnographically valid as well as replicable. Defining and measuring multiple causal pathways."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sugimoto noted that "for impact assessment of book-based fields, bibliometricians need a database with large numbers of books" and that while the Book Citation Index did meet this need, [[Google Books]] also fulfilled this purpose and was not only free, but was (at the time) more comprehensive for bibliometric analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cronin|first1=Blaise|last2=Sugimoto|first2=Cassidy R.|title=Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact|date=2014|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262323291|pages=33, 289, 296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxSaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=%22Book+Citation+Index%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ig9sVZ2QB4rLsASwyYHYBw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Book%20Citation%20Index%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article in the ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'' remarked on the index's opportunities and limitations. It stated that the "most significant limitations to this potential application are the high share of publications without address information, the inflation of publication counts, the lack of cumulative citation counts from different hierarchical levels, and inconsistency in citation counts between the cited reference search and the book citation index."&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorraiz|first1=Juan|last2=Purnell|first2=Philip J.|last3=Glänze|first3=Wolfgang|title=Opportunities for and limitations of the Book Citation Index|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=July 2013|volume=64|issue=7|pages=1388–1398|doi=10.1002/asi.22875|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22875/full|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the Book Citation Index was "a first step toward creating a reliable and necessary citation data source for monographs — a very challenging issue, because, unlike journals and conference proceedings, books have specific requirements, and several problems emerge not only in the context of subject classification, but also in their role as cited publications and in citing publications."&lt;ref name=journal /&gt;

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright|Representation of the Buddha in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], 1st century CE]]
{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist art''' is the [[art|artistic practices]] that are influenced by [[Buddhism]]. It includes art media which depict [[Buddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; [[mandala]]s and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as [[vajra]]s, bells, [[stupa]]s and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist temple architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Buddhist Art? |url=http://buddhistartnews.wordpress.com/what-is-buddhist-art/ |publisher=Buddhist Art News |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.&lt;ref name=blurton113&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 113-116, 160-162, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-iconic phase (5th century – 1st century BCE)==
{{See also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. 1st century BCE, [[Gandhara]].]]
During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha’s life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or [[frieze]]s, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas.
Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through [[Buddhist symbolism]]. This period may have been [[aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic]].

Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] (see: [[Mara (demon)|Mara's assault on the Buddha]]).
It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE The
[[Mahabodhi Temple]] at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma
and Indonesia. The frescoes at [[Sigiriya]] are said to be even older than the
[[Ajanta Caves]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art ]  Frontline Magazine 13–26 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconic phase (1st century CE – present)==
{{see also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Padmapani, cave 1, Ajanta, India.jpg|thumb|left|Over life-size figure of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Padmapani]], cave 1, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century]]
Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century CE in [[Northern India]]. The two main centers of creation have been identified as [[Gandhara]] in today’s [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]], in [[Pakistan]], and the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India.

Hellenistic culture was introduced in Gandhara during the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321–298 BCE), founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Macedonian satraps during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]] of 305–303 BCE. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] (reign: 268-232 BCE), who formed the largest Empire in the Indian subcontinent, converted to Buddhism following the [[Kalinga War]]. Abandoning an expansionist ideology, Ashoka worked to spread the religion and philosophy throughout his empire as described in the [[edicts of Ashoka]]. Ashoka claims to have converted the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

After the overthrow of the Mauryan Empire by the [[Shunga Empire]], the  [[Greco-Bactrian]] and subsequently the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdoms invaded north-western India. They facilitated the spread of Greco-Buddhist art style to other parts of the subcontinent. The Indo-Greek King [[Menander I]] was renown as a great patron of Buddhism, attaining the title of an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] persecuted Buddhism, presumably to further erase the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Caleb; Sarao, K. T. S. (2010). "Pushyamitra Sunga, a Hindu ruler in the second century BCE, was a great persecutor of Buddhists". In Danver, Steven L. Popular Controversies in World History. ABC-CLIO. p. 89. {{ISBN|9781598840780}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the decline of Buddhist art east of Mathura.

Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] in the forms of human figures and ornament. Figures were much larger than any known from India previously, and also more naturalistic, and new details included wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf ornament.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Inscribed Seated Buddha Image in Abhaya Mudra - Kushan Period - Katra Keshav Dev - ACCN A-1 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5972.JPG|thumb|Mathura school Buddha, [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]

The art of Mathura tends to be based on an Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the [[Yaksha|Yaksas]], although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin [[muslin]], the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mathura and Gandhara also influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] [[syncretism]].

This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Remains of early Buddhist painting in India are vanishingly rare, with the later phases of the [[Ajanta Caves]] giving the great majority of surviving work, created over a relatively short up to about 480 CE.  These are highly sophisticated works, evidently produced in a well-developed tradition, probably painting secular work in palaces as much as religious subjects.

Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of Mathura evolved during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (4th to 6th century CE) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. At the end of the 12th century CE, Buddhism in its full glory came to be preserved only in the Himalayan regions in India. These areas, helped by their location, were in greater contact with Tibet and China - for example the art and traditions of [[Ladakh]] bear the stamp of Tibetan and Chinese influence.
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century CE, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.
* A '''Northern route''' was established from the 1st century CE through [[Central Asia]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], in which [[Mahayana]] Buddhism prevailed.
* A '''Southern route''', where [[Theravada]] Buddhism dominated, went through [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]].

==Northern Buddhist art==
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|A Chinese wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE)]]

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Ming]] (58-75&amp;nbsp;AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], were either [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].

Central Asian missionary efforts along the [[Silk Road]] were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd through the 11th century in the Tarim Basin, modern [[Xinjiang]]. Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Pakistan]], combining Indian, Greek and [[Roman art|Roman]] influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of [[Kami|Japanese gods]].

The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mahāyāna goes beyond the traditional [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist]] ideal of the release from suffering ([[dukkha|duḥkha]]) of [[arhat]]s, and emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] path. The Mahāyāna sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the [[Paramita|Six Perfections]], ultimate knowledge ([[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings ([[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]).

===Afghanistan===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue from a Buddhist monastery, 700&amp;nbsp;AD, Afghanistan]]
Buddhist art in [[Afghanistan]] (old [[Bactria]]) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Other sculptures, in [[stucco]], [[schist]] or [[clay]], display very strong blending of Indian post-[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] mannerism and Classical influence, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]].

Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "[[People of the Book|of the Book]]", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "[[idolatry]]". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the [[Taliban]] regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.

The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.

===Central Asia===
{{See also|Dunhuang|Mogao Caves|Kingdom of Khotan|Silk Road|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serindian art]], 6th-7th century [[Terra cotta|terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]
[[Central Asia]] long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and [[Iran|Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.

The eastern part of Central Asia  ([[Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) in particular has revealed an extremely rich [[Serindian art]] ([[cave painting|wall paintings]] and [[relief]]s in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script [[Kharoshti]] have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}
Buddhism arrived in [[China]] around the 1st century CE, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of [[statue|statuary]]. Receiving this distant religion, strong Chinese traits were incorporated into Buddhist art.

====Northern Dynasties====
In the 5th to 6th centuries, the [[Northern Dynasties]] developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

Sites preserving Northern Wei Dynasty Buddhist sculpture:
*[[Yungang Grottoes]], [[Shanxi]]
*[[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]]
*[[Bingling Temple]], [[Gansu]]

====Tang Dynasty====
[[File:Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets by Chang Huai-hsing.jpg|thumb|right|''{{ill|Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets|yue|熾盛光佛並五星圖}}'', 897 A.D.]]
Following a transition under the [[Sui Dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. Because of the dynasty's openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] helped it gain a foothold in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous religion, [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.

[[Chán]] Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese [[Zen]], continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]

Early paintings by Chán monks tended to eschew the meticulous realism of [[Gongbi]] painting in favour of vigorous, monochrome paintings, attempting to express the impact of enlightenment through their brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, A; ''The imperial capitals of China: an inside view of the celestial empire'', Random House 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84595-010-1}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]] in the twelfth century resulted in considerable criticism of the monk-painters. Connected as they were with the then-unpopular school of Chan Buddhism, their paintings were discarded and ignored. Some paintings survived after being transported to Japan by visiting Zen monks, but the school of Chan painting gradually diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Valérie Malenfer; ''Dreaming the southern song landscape: the power of illusion in Chinese painting'', BRILL 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11011-3}} p161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing Dynasty====
During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu emperors supported Buddhist practices for a range of political and personal reasons. The [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] promoted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], claiming to be the human embodiment of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner, Marsha Smith, and Patricia Ann Berger. Latter Days of the Law : Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850-1850. Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was under the rule of the third Qing ruler, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], that imperial patronage of the Buddhist arts reached its height in this period. He commissioned a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style, many of which depicted him in various sacred guises.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art produced during this period are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p.webm|thumb|Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p]]
Additionally, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] initiated a number of large-scale construction projects; in 1744 he rededicated the [[Yonghe Temple]] as Beijing's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, donating a number of valuable religious paintings, sculptures, textiles and inscriptions to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xumi Fushou Temple]], and the works housed within, is another project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] that embodies the unique blend of Tibetan and Manchu artistic styles that characterized Buddhist art produced in China under Qianlong's reign.

After the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s abdication in 1795, the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism at the Qing court declined. The motives behind the Qing emperors' promotion of Tibetan Buddhism have been interpreted as a calculated act of political manipulation, and a means of forging ties between Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan communities, though this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Patricia Ann. Empire of Emptiness : Buddhist Art and Political Authority In Qing China. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy====
[[File:Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p.webm|thumb|Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p]]
The popularization of Buddhism in China has made the country home to one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts in the world. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Bingling Temple]] caves near [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] municipality are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

===Korea===
{{see also|Buddhism in Korea|Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korean art}}
[[Korea]]n Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and [[Scythia]]n influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as [[Silla]] [[Crown of Silla|royal crowns]], belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped [[gogok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/crown.htm |title=Crown |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Arts of Korea |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a {{clarify span|characteristic "barbarian" luxury|date=November 2012}}. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, ''Arts asiatiques- Guimet''').

====Three Kingdoms of Korea====
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], semi-seated contemplative Maitreya probably from Silla circa early 7th century.]]
The first of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] to officially receive Buddhism was [[Goguryeo]] in 372.&lt;ref name=graysonp25&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese records and the use of Buddhist motifs in Goguryeo murals indicate the introduction of Buddhism earlier than the official date.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baekje]] Kingdom officially recognized Buddhism in 384.&lt;ref name=graysonp25/&gt; The [[Silla]] Kingdom, isolated and with no easy sea or land access to China, officially adopted Buddhism in 535 although the foreign religion was known in the kingdom due to the work of Goguryeo monks since the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Encyclopedia of World History: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged |author1=Peter N.

Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan. Korean artisans were highly selective of the styles they incorporated and combined different regional styles together to create a specific Korean Buddhist art style.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), pp. 27 &amp; 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture, 5th&amp;ndash;9th Century |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Timeline of Arts History |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seokguram Buddha.JPG|upright|thumb|left|[[Seokguram Grotto]] is a [[World Heritage Site]] and dates to the [[Unified Silla]] era.]]
While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the [[Southern Dynasties]] of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the [[Baekje smile]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture (5th–9th century) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="kenyon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/Jap-Kor-art.htm |title=Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret |publisher=www2.kenyon.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple in Silla. Baekje architects were famed for their skill and were instrumental in building the massive nine-story pagoda at Hwangnyongsa and early Buddhist temples in Yamato Japan such as [[Asuka-dera|Hōkō-ji]] (Asuka-dera) and [[Hōryū-ji]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture |author1=Fletcher, B. |author2=Cruickshank, D. |date=1996 |publisher=Architectural Press |isbn=9780750622677 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gt1jTpXAThwC |page=716 |accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6th century Korean Buddhist art exhibited the cultural influences of China and India but began to show distinctive indigenous characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/06/eak/ht06eak.htm metmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; These indigenous characteristics can be seen in early Buddhist art in Japan and some early Japanese Buddhist sculpture is now believed to have originated in Korea, particularly from Baekje, or Korean artisans who immigrated to Yamato Japan. Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues. Although many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism, the Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Korea: A Religious History |author=Grayson, J.H. |date=2002 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=9780700716050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1BzL2lwPqEC |page=33 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unified Silla====
[[File:Goryeo Pagoda.jpg|thumb|160px|The Goryeo era [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]] sits on the first floor of the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
During the [[Unified Silla]] period, [[East Asia]] was particularly stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was also influenced by new [[Tang Dynasty]] styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with full-faced Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome of which is the [[Seokguram]] Grotto.

====Goryeo Dynasty====
The fall of the Unified Silla Dynasty and the establishment of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 918 indicates a new period of Korean Buddhist art. The Goryeo kings also lavishly sponsored Buddhism and Buddhist art flourished, especially Buddhist paintings and illuminated sutras written in gold and silver ink. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/eak/ht07eak.htm]. The crowning achievement of this period is the carving of approximately 80,000 woodblocks of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] which was done twice.

====Joseon Dynasty====
The [[Joseon Dynasty]] actively suppressed Buddhism beginning in 1406 and Buddhist temples and art production subsequently decline in quality in quantity although beginning in 1549, Buddhist art does continue to be produced.

===Japan===

[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ASURA in [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (734)]]
Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Japan]] had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic [[Jōmon]] from around 10500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;BC, to the art during the [[Yayoi]] and [[Kofun]] periods, with developments such as [[Haniwa]] art.

The cultural exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic has contributed to the development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indian Influence on the Art of Japan | author = Sampa Biswas | publisher = Northern Book Centre | year = 2010 | isbn = 9788172112691 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fLjcMfMGP10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Japan&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisg5jQrPrVAhWKMo8KHXxoBpEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Japan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], including a five-story [[pagoda]], the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].
Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Shinto]] influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.

From the 12th and 13th, a further development was [[Zen]] art, and it faces golden days in [[Muromachi Period]], following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[sumi-e]]) and poetry (especially [[haiku]]s), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial art]]s).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.

===Tibet and Bhutan===
{{See also|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}
[[File:Yama tibet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] 18th century, Tibet]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] (the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]], or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in [[Tibet]] from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, [[Nepal]]i, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.

One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the [[mandala]]s, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha.
Artistically, Buddhist [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.

In 10th to 11th centuries, [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Northern India (at that time part of Western Tibet Kingdom) serves an important role as an intermediary between India and Tibet cultural exchange, especially Buddhist art and philosophy. Notable example of Tibetan Buddhist art in Tabo is its exquisite frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tabo: a lamp for the kingdom : early Indo Tibetan Buddhist art in the western Himalaya, Archeologia, arte primitiva e orientale | author1 =Deborah E.

===Vietnam===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Trần-Hồ dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Chinese influence was predominant in the north of [[Vietnam]] (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and [[Confucianism]] and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent. Overall, the art of Vietnam has been strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art.

In the south thrived the former kingdom of [[Champa]] (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). [[Champa]] had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Many of its statues were characterized by rich body adornments. The capital of the kingdom of Champa was annexed by Vietnam in 1471, and it totally collapsed in the 1720s, while [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] remain an abundant minority across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Southern Buddhist art==
The orthodox forms of Buddhism, also known as Southern Buddhism are still practised in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise of the [[Parthia]]n empire in the [[Middle East]], an unvanquished enemy of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connections, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Thailand|Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cambodian Buddha, 14th century]]
For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.

Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] then the Burmese [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area. Between 8th- and 12th-century, under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], arts and ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism co-developed and became increasingly intermeshed.&lt;ref name=richardblurton202/&gt; However, with Muslim invasion and sacking of monasteries in India, states Richard Blurton,  "Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India".&lt;ref name=richardblurton202&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 202-204, Quote: "Buddhism flourished in this part of India throughout the first millennium AD, especially under the patronage of Pala kings of the eighth and twelfth centuries. Towards the end of this period, popular Buddhism and Hinduism became increasingly intermeshed. However, when Muslim invaders from further west sacked the monasteries in the twelfth century, Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple.]]

By the 8th to 9th century, [[Sailendra]]n Buddhist art were developed and flourished in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] kingdom of [[Central Java]], Indonesia. This period marked the renaissance of Buddhist art in Java, as numerous exquisite monuments were built, including [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Mendut]] and [[Borobudur]] stone mandala. The traditions would continue to the 13th century [[Singhasari]] Buddhist art of East Java.

From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the [[Bodhisattva]]s.
The [[Theravada]] Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from [[Sri Lanka]], and was adopted by the newly founded [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Since in Theravada Buddhism of the period, Monasteries typically were the central places for the laity of the towns to receive instruction and have disputes arbitrated by the monks, the construction of temple complexes plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.

From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of [[Islam]] to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the [[Southern Philippines]]. In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into Burma, [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
According to tradition, Buddhism was introduced in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries under the guidance of Thera [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the son of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic world full of superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The earliest monastic complex was the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahāvihāra]] at [[Anuradhapura|Anurādhapura]] founded by [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devānampiyatissa]] and presented to Mahinda Thera. The Mahāvihāra became the centre of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the [[Abhayagiri Vihāra]] around BC 89 by [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura|Vaţţagāmaņĩ]].

The Abhayagiri Vihāra became the seat of the reformed Mahāyāna doctrines. The rivalry between the monks of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri led to a further split and the foundation of the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavanarama]] near the Mahāvihāra. The main feature of Sinhala Buddhism was its division into three major groups, or ''nikāyas'', named after the three main monastic complexes at Anurādhapura; the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri, and the Jetavanārāma. This was the result in the deviations in the disciplinary rules ''(vinaya)'' and doctrinal disputes. All the other monasteries of Sri Lanka owed ecclesiastical allegiance to one of the three. Sri Lanka is famous for its creations of Buddhist sculptures made of stone and cast in bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;von Schroeder, Ulrich. 1990. ''Buddhist Sculptures of Sri Lanka''.

===Myanmar===
[[File:Buddha 00004.JPG|thumb|upright|A Mandalay-style statue of Buddha]]
A neighbor of India, [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The [[Mon people|Mon]] of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200&amp;nbsp;BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king [[Ashoka]], before the schism between [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.

Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at [[Bagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the [[Mongols]] in 1287.
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 15-18.jpg|thumbnail|left|Scenes from the life of the Buddha in an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]
During the [[Ava Kingdom|Ava period]], from the 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa [[mudra]].&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part1/post_pagan_period__part_1.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 1 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], at the end of the 18th century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day.&lt;ref name="niu2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part3/post_pagan_period__part_3.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 3 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/mandalay_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.

Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the [[Shan people]], who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/shan_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cambodia]] was the center of the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom, which expanded into Burma and as far south as Malaysia between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Its influence seems to have been essentially political, most of the cultural influence coming directly from India.

Later, from the 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated vast parts of the Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost in the development of Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of [[Jayavarman VII]], a Buddhist king that built [[Angkor Thom]] walled city, adorned with the smiling face of [[Lokeshvara]] in Angkor Thom ''dvaras'' (gates) and ''prasat'' towers [[Bayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Monuments and Temples of Cambodia and Laos | author = W.

A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.

Often, Khmer art manages to express intense spirituality through divinely beaming expressions, in spite of spare features and slender lines.

[[File:Wat Si Chum in Sukhothai.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Phra Atchana [[Wat Si Chum]], [[Sukhothai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]
The Thai Buddhist art encompasses period for more than a millennia, from pre Thai culture of Dvaravati and Srivijaya, to the first Thai capital of Thai 13th century Sukhothai, all the way to  succeeding Thai kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"&gt;{{cite book | title = Thai Buddhist Art: Discover Thai Art | author = Dawn F.

From the 1st to the 7th centuries, Buddhist art in [[Thailand]] was first influenced by direct contact with Indian traders and the expansion of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom, leading to the creation of Hindu and Buddhist art inspired from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] tradition, with numerous monumental statues of great virtuosity.

From the 9th century, the various schools of Thai art then became strongly influenced by Cambodian [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] art in the north and [[Sri Vijaya]] art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the subject matter is characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] pantheon with multiple creations of [[Bodhisattva]]s.

From the 13th century, [[Theravada]] Buddhism was introduced from Sri Lanka around the same time as the [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; The new faith inspired highly stylized images in Thai Buddhism, with sometimes very geometrical and almost abstract figures.

During the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th-18th centuries), the Buddha came to be represented in a more stylistic manner with sumptuous garments and jeweled ornamentations. Many Thai sculptures or temples tended to be [[gilding|gilded]], and on occasion enriched with inlays.

The ensuing period of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] saw the further development of Thai Buddhist art.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; By the 18th century, [[Bangkok]] was established as the royal center of the kingdom of [[Siam]]. Subsequently, the Thai rulers filled the city with imposing Buddhist monuments to demonstrate their Buddhist piety as well as to showcase their authority. Among others are the celebrated [[Wat Phra Kaew]] which hosts the [[Emerald Buddha]]. Other Buddhist temples in Bangkok includes [[Wat Arun]] with ''prang'' style towers, and [[Wat Pho]] with its famous image of [[Reclining Buddha]].

Like the rest of Southeast Asia, [[Indonesia]] seems to have been most strongly influenced by India from the 1st century CE. The islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] in western Indonesia were the seat of the empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] (8th-13th century), which came to dominate most of the area around the Southeast Asian peninsula through maritime power. The Sri Vijayan Empire had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]. The Sailendras was the ardent temple builder and the devoted patron of Buddhism in Java.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java | author1 = Jean Philippe Vogel | author2 = Adriaan Jacob Barnouw | publisher = Asian Educational Services | year = 1936 | isbn = 9788120612259 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wQ2x0cbZkn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm_6o6PfVAhXKo48KHUc_DuEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Java&amp;f=false| pages = 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Vijaya spread Mahayana Buddhist art during its expansion into the Southeast Asian peninsula. Numerous statues of Mahayana [[Bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. One of the earliest Buddhist inscription in Java, the [[Kalasan inscription]] dated 778, mentioned about the construction of a [[Kalasan|temple]] for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt;

[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of [[Prajnaparamita of Java|Prajñāpāramitā from Singhasari]], East Java.]]
Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of [[Borobudur]] (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built  around 780-850&amp;nbsp;AD), built by Sailendras.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt; This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the [[Mandala]] which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | author = John Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=borobudur+golden+tales+of+the+buddhas&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP45O7r_rVAhWJtY8KHcpuAfYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20art&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around the 4th century. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of [[Boddhisatva]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], and [[Kinnara]] found in [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sewu|Sewu]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], and [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]] temple is very graceful with serene expression, While [[Mendut]] temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]].

In [[Sumatra]] Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]]. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from [[Singhasari]] kingdom.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, then followed by [[Majapahit]] empire.

==Contemporary Buddhist art==
[[File:Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism (1916) (14779469804).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration from the book "Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism" (1916).]]
Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are [[Bill Viola]], in his video installations,&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Connell]], in sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;ARTlines, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Graham]] in his multi-media "Time is Memory".&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Rail, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[The Network of Buddhist Organisations]] has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower";&lt;ref&gt;a poster advertising one of the events is archived here - http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824213345/http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf# |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwbo-news.blogspot.com/2009/07/report-from-buddha-mind-creative-mind.html |title=Triratna Buddhist Community News: Report from ‘Buddha Mind - Creative Mind?’ conference |author=Lokabandhu |publisher=fwbo-news.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.&lt;ref name="ning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dharmaarts.ning.com/ |title=Dharma Arts Network - Launched at Buddha Mind - Creative Mind ? |publisher=dharmaarts.ning.com |accessdate=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000408/http://dharmaarts.ning.com/# |archive-date=10 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
'''Chonga''' is a Spanish-derived term used especially in [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]], often to indicate a working-class, sexualized, aggressive, and emotionally expressive young woman.

Chongas are also a distinct [[subculture]], believed to have developed in [[Miami]] in the late 20th century. Members are typically young, working-class Latina women. In South Florida the term is usually considered a pejorative, though some young women are proud to identify themselves as such. While feminist scholarship on chongas is limited, early work by [[gender studies]] scholar Jillian Hernandez has suggested that the chonga identity is an "emerging [[icon]]", and that it can be empowering for working-class women.

==Etymology and meaning==
The intended meaning of the term "chonga" varies depending on the context in which it is used. The most specific meaning of the term denotes a member of the chonga subculture—young, usually working class and Latina women—who dress and often act in a sexualized, brash, sometimes aggressive manner. The term also has three looser meanings: as a synonym for prostitute; to refer to a woman who acts "gangsta" or in a thug like manner; and among female friends, as a jovial way to greet each other, as an alternative to "girlfriend!"&lt;ref name="hern68"&gt;Hernandez 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"&gt;Lush 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term to refer to young women is believed to have arisen in [[Miami]], and only became prominent in the early 21st century. The same word has long been used in Latin American countries such as [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]] to refer to a brothel; the modern US usage of the word may be related to this, or might have arisen independently among Floridian Cuban-Americans. 

"Chonga" has lexical similarities with several other Spanish terms, some of which have been in use for centuries.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; These include: 
* ''[[Cholo|chola]]''  - used in the [[Southwestern United States]] for women of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] or [[Mexican American|Mexican-American]] descent, sometimes with the added meaning that they are a "homegirl" or someone from the streets.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chula'' - which denotes a cute or sexy young woman.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chusma'' - in the US, this term is often used to denote  an oversexualized and under-Americanized woman of [[Cuban people|Cuban]] descent. In Latin America, the term can merely refer to loud, working-class women, and can even refer to a rabble, some of whom might not be female.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chonga subculture==
According to the journalist Tamara Lush, Chonga subculture may have first appeared in [[Miami]] during the 1980s. Early chongas were usually Cuban teenagers whose parents had recently immigrated to the US. In the 1990s, chongas often wore white shorts with a colored thong underneath, basketball jerseys, and fake gold jewelry. Over the years the style evolved, with for instance tight jeans becoming more popular than shorts.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;

===Chonga characteristics===
21st-century chongas will often exhibit at least some of the following characteristics: 
*Cheap but sexy clothing, which often includes "Brazilian jeans"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Pocketless [[Skinny jeans]] that usually have an accentuating effect on the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and revealing tops, a preference for gelled hair, synthetic nails and gaudy jewelry, often including fake gold, bangles and earring hoops.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Chongas sometimes like to have their names written on the hoops.&lt;/ref&gt;   
*Sexual availability, often along with a preference to be surrounded by men.  
*Hostility to other young women, unless they are fellow members of the same chonga crew.  
*Loud, emotionally expressive and aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', and esp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all chongas live up to these stereotypes; for example, sometimes women whose conduct is the most overtly sexualized will in fact be among the least interested in actual heterosexual encounters—in some cases chonga behavior is perhaps best understood as a kind of bonding between female friends.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depictions in the media===
Until 2007, chongas have rarely appeared in the media, despite their high visibility in real life. One of the rare exceptions was the ''Cheerleaders'' (2000) set of art photographs by [[Luis Gispert]].&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisgispert.com/index.php#mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=16&amp;p=1&amp;a=0&amp;at=0 The cheerleader set of images on Gispert's web site]. Not all pics feature chonga-like lasses; for an iconic image discussed at length in Hernandez, see pic no. 15. See also pic nos. 3, 9, 16 &amp; 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, the few exceptions include [[Bratz]] dolls which have a chonga-like appearance; the chonga-like characters Lydia and Melina in the television comedy [[MADtv]]; and the chonga-like character Tina in the movie ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Chongas became considerably more common in popular culture after the 2007 release of [[Chongalicious]], a YouTube [[viral video]]. Hernandez noted that the only depiction she's aware of that accurately showed chongas in their social context was the 2007 "Bratz girls" exhibition by the ''GisMo Collective'' (Jessica Gispert and Crystal Molinary).&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 68, 79-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cultural and gender studies===
According to a 2009 article by gender studies scholar Jillian Hernandez, feminist literature covering chongas remains sparse, even after their profile was raised by the ''Chongalicious'' video. Hernandez contrasts this with the extensive body of work on [[Chicana feminism]], which explores the ''chola'' and ''chusma'' phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez argues the chonga image has become iconic in Miami, and states that the aesthetic appeal of the chonga can be considerable, which in her opinion partly explains why the ''cheerleaders'' set of photographs was successful in launching Gispert's international career.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrayal of chongas in the media can, however, be problematic, sometimes even repressive, as powerful negative images contribute to Latinas internalizing pressure to conform which originates from the dominant Anglo-American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guzmán  2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypical representations of chongas can play a role in the United States' wider [[culture wars#United States of America|culture wars]], adding to concerns about the sexuality of some Latina women being "out of control" with their perceived high rate of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing earlier work by Isabel Molina Guzmán,&lt;ref&gt;''Disorderly Bodies and Discourses of Latinidad in the Elián González Story'', Isabel Molina Guzmán (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez relates this to the [[Elián González affair]], where the media portrayal of Marisleysis González as having the chonga-like characteristic of emotional excess contributed to the degradation of the  privileged, "model minority status" that [[Cuban Americans]] had previously enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her own research, Hernandez found that most people she questioned considered "chonga" a pejorative term. One respondent even went as far as to say the term sums up all the negative Latina stereotypes. A few asserted that while they know several chongas, they don't know any who self-identify as such. Sometimes Latina women will admit they went through a brief "chonga" phase in their early teens, but later came to view the style as uncool. Yet some chongas chose to retain the identity into their twenties. Hernandez also found that some young woman are proud to call themselves chongas. Several expressed pride in their sexual attractiveness. The creators of "Chongalicious", who are themselves middle class, found they had considerably more male attention while pretending to be chongas, one of them saying back in 2007 that "I think we would have boyfriends if we were real chongas."&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; Hernandez suggests that the chonga sub culture is in several ways a positive thing, representing women who are not shamed into invisibility by their low-class status or ethnic identity. She anticipates a broadening and deepening of feminist scholarship on chongas, to uncover the ways in which the chonga identity can be helpful to young women exploring their "bodies and pleasures".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Hernandez notes that she is consciously echoing [[Michel Foucault]] in using the term "bodies and pleasures", as she sees it as a more empowering alternative to "sexuality".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', esp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literary theory]] and [[philosophy of language]], the '''chronotope''' is how configurations of time and space are represented in [[language]] and [[discourse]]. The term was taken up by Russian literary scholar [[Bakhtin|M.M. Bakhtin]] who used it as a central element in his theory of meaning in language and literature. The term itself comes from the Russian ''{{lang|ru|xронотоп}}'', which in turn is derived from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|χρόνος}}'' ('[[time]]') and ''{{lang|grc|τόπος}}'' ('[[space]]'); it thus can be literally translated as "time-space." Bakhtin developed the term in his 1937 essay "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" ({{lang|ru|Формы времени и хронотопа в романе}}). Here Bakhtin showed how different literary genres operated with different configurations of time and space, which gave each genre its particular narrative character. For example, the chronotopic frame of the epic differed from that of the hero adventure or the comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=M.|year=1981|chapter=Forms of time and of the chronotope in the novel|title=In The Dialogic Imagination|pages=84–258|location=Austin|publisher=Univ. Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
In the [[philosophy of language]] and [[philology]], Bakhtin scholars [[Caryl Emerson]] and [[Michael Holquist]] state that the chronotope is "a unit of analysis for studying language according to the ratio and characteristics of the temporal and spatial categories represented in that language". Specific chronotopes are said to correspond to particular [[genre]]s, or relatively stable ways of speaking, which themselves represent particular [[worldview]]s or [[ideology|ideologies]]. To this extent, a chronotope is both a cognitive concept and a narrative feature of language.

In "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel," Bakhtin defines the chronotope thus:

{{quote|text=We will give the name chronotope (literally, "time space") to the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature. This term [space-time] is employed in mathematics, and was introduced as part of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. The special meaning it has in relativity theory is not important for our purposes; we are borrowing it for literary criticism almost as a metaphor (almost, but not entirely). What counts for us is the fact that it expresses the inseparability of space and time (time as the fourth dimension of space). We understand the chronotope as a formally constitutive category of literature; we will not deal with the chronotope in other areas of culture.' In the literary artistic chronotope, spatial and temporal indicators are fused into one carefully thought-out, concrete whole. Time, as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history. This intersection of axes and fusion of indicators characterizes the artistic chronotope.
The chronotope in literature has an intrinsic generic significance. It can even be said that it is precisely the chronotope that defines genre and generic distinctions, for in literature the primary category in the chronotope is time. The chronotope as a formally constitutive category determines to a significant degree the image of man in literature as well. The image of man is always intrinsically chronotopic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=M.|year=1981|chapter=Forms of time and of the chronotope in the novel|title=In The Dialogic Imagination|pages=84-85|location=Austin|publisher=Univ. Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Examples ==
The concept of the chronotope has been most widely used in literary studies. The scholar Timo Müller for example argued that analysis of chronotopes highlights the environmental dimension of literary texts because it draws attention to the concrete physical spaces in which stories take place. Müller discusses the chronotope of the road, which for Bakhtin was a meeting place but in recent literature no longer brings people together in this way because automobiles have changed the way we perceive the time and space of the road. Car drivers want to minimize the time they spend on the road. They are rarely interested in the road as a physical space, the natural environment around the road, or the environmental implications of their driving. This contrasts with earlier literary examples such as [[Robert Frost]]'s poem "The Road Not Taken" or [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''The Grapes of Wrath'', where the road is described as part of the natural environment and the travelers are interested in that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Timo|title=Notes Toward an Ecological Conception of Bakhtin’s ‘Chronotope.’|url=http://ecozona.eu/article/viewFile/327/301|date=2010}}; {{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Timo|chapter=The Ecology of Literary Chronotopes|title=Handbook of Ecocriticism and Cultural Ecology|date=2016|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/206422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic anthropologist [[Keith Basso]] invoked "chronotopes" in discussing Western [Apache] stories linked with places. In the 1980s when Basso was writing, geographic features reminded the [[Western Apache]] of "the moral teachings of their history" by recalling to mind events that occurred there in important moral narratives. By merely mentioning "it happened at [the place called] 'men stand above here and there,'" storyteller Nick Thompson could remind locals of the dangers of joining "with outsiders against members of their own community." Geographic features in the Western Apache landscape are chronotopes, Basso says, in precisely the way Bakhtin defines the term when he says they are "points in the geography of a community where time and space intersect and fuse. Time takes on flesh and becomes visible for human contemplation; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time and history and the enduring character of a people. ...Chronotopes thus stand as monuments to the community itself, as symbols of it, as forces operating to shape its members' images of themselves" (qtd. in Basso 1984: 44–45).

Anthropologist of syncretism [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/safet-hadzimuhamedovic/index.html Safet HadžiMuhamedović] built upon [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin’s]] term in his ethnography of the [[Gatačko Polje|Field of Gacko]] in the southeastern Bosnian highlands. In [http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HadziMuhamedovicWaiting ''Waiting for'' ''Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape''], he argued that people and landscapes may sometimes be trapped between timespaces and thus '''''"schizochronotopic"''''' (from the Greek σχίζειν (''skhizein''): "to split").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape|last=HadžiMuhamedović|first=Safet|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78533-856-4|location=New York and Oxford|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described two overarching chronotopes as "collective timespace themes", both of which relied on certain kinds of past and laid claims to the Field’s future. One was told through proximities, the other through distances between religious communities. For HadžiMuhamedović, '''''schizochronotopia''''' is a rift occurring within the same body/landscape, through which the past and the present of place have rendered each other unbidden. 

The chronotope has also been adopted for the analysis of classroom events and conversations, for example by Raymond Brown and [[Peter Renshaw]] in order to view "student participation in the classroom as a dynamic process constituted through the interaction of past experience, ongoing involvement, and yet-to-be-accomplished goals" (2006: 247–259). Kumpulainen, Mikkola, and Jaatinen (2013) examined the space–time configurations of students’ technology-mediated creative learning practices over a year-long school musical project in a Finnish elementary school. The findings of their study suggest that "blended practices appeared to break away from traditional learning practices, allowing students to navigate in different time zones, spaces, and places with diverse tools situated in their formal and informal lives" (2013: 53).

More broadly, the term used has been used to describe the [[Post-Fordism|post-Fordist]], [[postmodern]] belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past; is something unique in human history; and due to this radical change, previous rules will no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 44 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Urry, ''Climate Change and Society'' (2011) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polarities in emerging economies==
Epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force, favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance, as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and [[Gemeinschaft]].&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Khlief, ''Language, Ethnicity and Education in Wales'' (1980) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated: nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices, as well as to epochalism, in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western [[Conceptual model|model]]/Western control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Said]], ''Culture and Imperialism'' (1993) p. 263 and p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet epochalism==
The rapid rise of the [[World Wide Web]] led many [[digerati]] to see it as an unprecedented human phenomenon, wholly divorced from all past experience.&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evgeny Morozov]] used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that "one is living in truly exceptional times – an intellectual fallacy I call 'epochalism{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous technological advances, as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting,&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; had of course made very similar claims for themselves; and [[A. E. Housman]] a century before had denounced the mind "which commands no outlook upon the past or the future, but believes that the fashion of the present, unlike all fashions heretofore, will endure perpetually".&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Housman, ''Collected Poems and Selected Prose'' (1988) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Late modernity]] however, with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present,&lt;ref&gt;I. Craib, ''The Importance of Disappointment'' (1994) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture.

{{confuse|Ethnos (disambiguation){{!}}Ethnos}}
[[File:Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly and the statue Ethos.jpg|thumb|A sculpture representing Ethos outside the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] in Canberra, Australia]]
'''Ethos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|iː|θ|oʊ|s}}) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "character" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero and Taruskin, Richard, "Music in the Western World: A History in Documents" (1984) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek stories of [[Orpheus]] exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in [[rhetoric]] is closely based on the Greek terminology used by [[Aristotle]] in his concept of the three artistic proofs or [[modes of persuasion]].

==Etymology and origin==
''Ethos'' ({{lang|grc|ἦθος}}, {{lang|grc|ἔθος}}; ''plurals:'' ''ethe'', {{lang|grc|ἤθη}}; ''ethea'', {{lang|grc|ἤθεα}}) is a Greek word originally meaning "accustomed place" (as in {{lang|grc|ἤθεα ἵππων}} "the habitats of horses", ''[[Iliad]]'' 6.511, 15.268),&lt;ref&gt;Proscurcin Jr., ''Der Begriff Ethos bei Homer.'' (2014) pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; "custom, habit", equivalent to Latin ''[[mores]]''.

''Ethos'' forms the root of ''ethikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἠθικός}}), meaning "moral, showing moral character".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Book 2 (1103a17)&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective in the neuter plural form ''ta ethika'' ({{lang|grc|τὰ ἠθικά}}), used for the study of morals, it is the origin of the modern English word ''[[ethics]]''.

==Current usage==
In modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values particular to a specific person, people, corporation, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote in 1940 that "the general ethos of the people they have to govern  determines the behaviour of politicians".&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Eliot, ''The idea of a Christian society'' (1940) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the historian [[Orlando Figes]] wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s "the ethos of the  [[Communist]] party dominated every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''A people's tragedy: the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], 1891–1924'' (1996) p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This statement requires further elaboration to be intelligible: When used in the rhetorical tradition, in addition to what motivates the individual, ethos establishes credibility for the individual among the audience, which is essential in a successful attempt at persuasion.--&gt;
Ethos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Afrie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1930s brought about "the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development".&lt;ref&gt;Afrie Krampf, "Reception of the Developmental Approach in the Jewish Economic Discourse of Mandatory Palestine, 1934–1938," ''Israel Studies,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 15#2, pp. 80–103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
In [[rhetoric]], ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (''pistis'', πίστις) or [[modes of persuasion]] (other principles being ''[[logos#Aristotle.27s rhetorical logos|logos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]'') discussed by [[Aristotle]] in '[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start.  This can involve "moral competence" only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include [[expertise]] and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ethos Dwells Pervasively'' In: ''The Ethos of Rhetoric.'' (2004) pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woerther, ''L'èthos aristotélicien.'' (2007) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf [[Isocrates]]).

According to [[Aristotle]], there are three categories of ethos:

* ''[[phronesis]]''&amp;nbsp;– useful skills &amp; wisdom
* ''[[Arete (excellence)|arete]]''&amp;nbsp;– virtue, goodwill
* ''[[eunoia]]''&amp;nbsp;– goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:

* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy ([[Appeal to motive]]). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.

===Modern interpretations===
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

For Aristotle, a speaker's ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to "inspire trust in his audience" (''Rhetorica'' 1380). ''Ethos'' was therefore achieved through the orator's "good sense, good moral character, and goodwill", and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this "good moral character" was increased in virtuous degree by habit (''Rhetorica'' 1380). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and ''ethos'' most succinctly in Book II of ''Nichomachean Ethics'': "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name ''ethike'' is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word ''ethos'' (habit)" (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: "Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety" (13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man Cannot Speak for Her: Volume I; A Critical Study of Early Feminist Rhetoric|last = Campbell|first = Karlyn Kohrs|publisher = Praeger|year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counterpublics. While Warner contends that members of counterpublics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas's conception of the public sphere as a dominant "social totality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and Counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by theorizing "subaltern counterpublics", which function as alternative publics that represent "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs" (67).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of the Actually Existing Democracy|last = Fraser|first = Nancy|date = 1990|journal = Social Text|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer more nuanced ways to conceive of ethos, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women's use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, "Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker's identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak" (83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constructing Essences: Ethos and the Postmodern Subject of Feminism|last = Schmertz|first = Johanna|date = 1999|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar and professor Kate Ronald's claim that "ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker's private and public self", (39)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Reexamination of Personal and Public Discourse in Classical Rhetoric|last = Ronald|first = Kate|date = 1990|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links [[credibility]] and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that "these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher's sense. Rather they are 'deceptions' in the sophistic sense: recognitions of the ways one is positioned multiply differently" (56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethos: New Essays in Rhetorical and Critical Theory|last = Susan|first = Jarratt|publisher = Southern Methodist University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Dallas|pages = 37–69|last2 = Reynolds|first2 = Nedra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos "emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private" (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of ''ethos'', Halloran illuminates the interdependence between ''ethos'' and cultural context by arguing that "To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks" (60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Aristotle's Concept of Ethos, or if not His, Someone Else's|last = Halloran|first = Michael|date = 1982|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre's argument in ''Invention as Social Act'' situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos "appears in that socially created space, in the 'between', the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader" (45-46).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invention as a Social Act|last = LeFevre|first = K. B.|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nedra Reynolds, "ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces" (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim "that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'" because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community, and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one's ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure's "ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices" (48).

In "Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos", scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction, and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, "Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans' ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture" (43).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos: Harriet Jacobs, Billie Holiday, and Sister Souljah|last = Pittman|first = Corretta|date = 2007|journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in Greek tragedy==
The ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, ''Aristotle's Poetics.'' (1998) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple.&lt;ref name=M534&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Ancient Theater and Performance Culture'' In: ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theater.'' (2007) pp. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This limited the scope of the play and characterization, so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.&lt;ref name=M546&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon in the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.&lt;ref name=M59&gt;Murray (1916), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, ''Aristoteles über das Wesen und die Wirkung der Tragödie (Kap. 6)'' In: ''Aristoteles. Poetik.'' (2009) pp. 87 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character.&lt;ref name=G247&gt;Garton (1957), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-caste, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint.&lt;ref name=G2478&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse.&lt;ref name=G248&gt;Garton (1957), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterisation is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterised by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.&lt;ref name=G2489&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garet makes three more observations about character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer's need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=G250&gt;Garton (1957), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterisation. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components' effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character's impact on action.&lt;ref name=G2501&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle's statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but character cannot exist without plot, and so character is secondary to plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle's statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Murray (1916), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that "[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot".&lt;ref name=M53&gt;Murray (1916), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character, or ethos, in pictorial narrative==
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

Ethos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture, referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject's ethical character and through this the work's overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can.&lt;ref name=C11&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle's idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 178) Professor Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character's moral choices. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O'Donnell's statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action.&lt;ref name=C10&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle's opinion that "his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public". Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, "[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the [[polis]]".&lt;ref name=C10 /&gt; Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character's choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O'Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 177.) Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks' conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, "ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality".&lt;ref name=C12&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''fabula crepidata''''' or '''''fabula cothurnata''''' is a Latin tragedy with Greek subjects. The genre probably originated in adaptations of [[Greek tragedy]] (hence the names, coming from ''crepida'' = ''sandal'' and ''[[Buskin|cothurnus]]'') beginning in  the early third century B.C. Only nine have survived intact, all by [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca]]. Of the plays written by [[Lucius Livius Andronicus]], [[Gnaeus Naevius]], [[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]], [[Lucius Accius]], and others, only titles, small fragments, and occasionally brief summaries are left. [[Ovid]]'s ''Medea'' also did not survive.

'''Family resemblance''' refers to physical similarities shared between close relatives, especially between [[parents]] and children and between [[siblings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abroadintheyard.com/dna-family-resemblance-across-generations/ Who Do You Look Like? DNA and Family Resemblance Across Generations]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], the similarities of [[personality]] are also observed.

==Genetics==
[[Heritability]], defined as a measure of family resemblance, causes traits to be genetically passed from parents to offspring ([[heredity]]), allowing evolutionarily advantageous traits to persist through generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolinska B | title = Resemblance and investment in children | language = fr | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 285–90 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 22385106 | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2011.645482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremblay BL, Guénard F, Lamarche B, Pérusse L, Vohl MC | title = Familial resemblances in human whole blood transcriptome | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 300 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29703154 | pmc = 5921553 | doi = 10.1186/s12864-018-4698-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bochud M | title = Estimating heritability from nuclear family and pedigree data | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 850 | pages = 171–86 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22307699 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-61779-555-8_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Princeton Guide to Evolution|last=Brodie|first=Edmond | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2014 |isbn=|location=|pages=221–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite sharing parents, siblings do not inherit identical genes, making [[Twin study|studies on identical twins]] (who have identical DNA) especially effective at analyzing the role genetics play in [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] similarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plomin R, Daniels D | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–82 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21807642 | pmc = 3147063 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyq148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have found that generational resemblance of many [[phenotypic trait]]s results from the inheritance of multiples genes that collectively influence a trait ([[Genetic variance|additive genetic variance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Polderman TJ, Benyamin B, de Leeuw CA, Sullivan PF, van Bochoven A, Visscher PM, Posthuma D | title = Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies | language = En | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 47 | issue = 7 | pages = 702–9 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25985137 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of heritability in personality traits. For example, one study found that approximately half of personality differences in high-school aged fraternal and identical twins were due to [[genetic variation]] - and another study suggests that no one personality trait is more heritable than another.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahern|first=Frank M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Ronald C.|last3=Wilson|first3=James R.|last4=McClearn|first4=Gerald E.|last5=Vandenberg|first5=Steven G. | name-list-format = vanc |date= May 1982 |title=Family resemblances in personality |journal=Behavior Genetics|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=261–280|doi=10.1007/bf01067847|issn=0001-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
Family resemblance is also shaped by environmental factors, [[temperature]], [[light]], [[Human nutrition|nutrition]], exposure to [[drug]]s, the time that different family members spend in shared and non-shared environments, are examples of factors found to influence phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/environmental-influences-on-gene-expression-536|title=Environmental Influences on Gene Expression {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plomin R, Daniels D | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–82 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21807642 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyq148 | pmc = 3147063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhUvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 |title=Evolutionary Theory: Fringe or Central to Psychological Science|last=Sulikowski|first=Danielle | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-08-08|publisher=Frontiers Media SA|isbn=9782889199204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenotypes found to be largely environmentally determined in humans include [[personality]], [[Human height|height]], and [[Human body weight|weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eysenck|first=H.

The concept of '''friction of distance''' is based on the notion that [[distance]] usually requires some amount of [[Work (physics)|effort]], [[energy]], time, and/or other [[resource]]s to overcome.  Because of this "[[friction]]", spatial [[interaction]]s, especially [[transport]] and the particular case of [[human migration]], will tend to take place more often over shorter distances; amount and intensity of interaction will [[distance decay|decay with distance]].  Regardless of physical friction, the various [[cost]]s are metaphorically assumed to correspond to forces that impede movements.

Friction, be it physical or metaphorical, may be a continuous, smooth function or may contain jumps; it may be constant, linear, or nonlinear or a combination of jumps and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] effects, as with [[Intermodal freight transport]] and [[Intermodal passenger transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch7en/conc7en/frictionspace.html

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6588">The '''Futures of American Studies''' is a weeklong academic summer institute dedicated to presenting new work and critiquing the field of [[American Studies]] held at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. The first Futures of American Studies Institute was held in the summer of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;The Futures of American Studies. http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald E. Pease]], Professor of English at Dartmouth College, founded, organizes, and directs the annual Institute.&lt;ref&gt;''Futures of American Studies,'' Edited by Donald E. Pease, Robyn Wiegman, Duke University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8223-2957-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of the Institute==
After the [[School of Criticism and Theory]] left Dartmouth for [[Cornell University]] in 1995, Dartmouth faculty member Donald E. Pease started the Futures Institute as an alternative summer program for faculty and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures/about/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Futures Institute celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its founding.

==Institute Description==
The Institute is divided into two daily plenary sessions, which feature current work from Institute faculty, and multiple three-hour research seminars in which all participants present and discuss their own work-in-progress. Speakers in the plenary sessions typically examine the relation between emergent and residual practices in the field of American Studies from a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives. Participants come from a variety of programs and schools and represent fields as diverse as American history, social geography, American literature, gender studies, and the digital humanities. The Institute welcomes participants who are involved in a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields and who are interested in current critical debates in American Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age of formation==
There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's [[Language acquisition|lack of language]] requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"&gt;Boles, 2013. Pages 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; John Money suggested children might have awareness of, and attach some significance to gender, as early as 18 months to two years; Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few authorities say it forms between ages 3-4 rather than precisely at age 3, e.g. George J. Bryjak and Michael P. Soraka, ''Sociology: Cultural Diversity in a Changing World'' (ed. Karen Hanson), Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1997; 209-245&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bates Doob, ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society''&lt;/ref&gt; although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender.&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Coleman, ''Developmental stages of the coming out process'', in ''Journal of homosexuality'', 1982: "Core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 (Money &amp; Ehrhardt, 1972). This is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth&lt;ref name="Kleeman"&gt;J. A. Kleeman, ''The establishment of core gender identity in normal girls. I.(a) Introduction;(b) Development of the ego capacity to differentiate'', in the ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 1971: "Though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer, core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3[.]"&lt;/ref&gt; to sixth years of age,&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein MT, Zucker KJ, Dixon SD. December, 1997. "Gender Identity", ''The Nurse Practitioner''. Vo. 22, No. 12, P. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and continues into young adulthood.&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt;

Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5–7 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this "peak of rigidity," fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C. | last2 = Ruble | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Children's Search for Gender Cues Cognitive Perspectives on Gender Development | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13| issue = 2|pages = 67–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning [[gender role]] standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.&lt;ref name="Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newmann|first=Barbara|title=Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111344665|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTY_7osGmqUC|date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UN agencies, discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics, such as gender and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing formation==

===Nature vs. nurture===
{{Main|Nature versus nurture}}

Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as "nature versus nurture". Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"&gt;''Effects of male sex hormones on gender identity, sexual behavior, and cognitive function'', ''Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao, Yi Xue Ban'' (''Journal of Central South University, Medical Sciences''), April 2006, 31(2):149-61&lt;/ref&gt; While genetic makeup also influences gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not inflexibly determine it.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Golombok, Robyn Fivush, ''Gender Development'' (1994, {{ISBN|0521408628}}), page 44: "When assigned and raised as boys, these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role, showing that a Y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction."&lt;/ref&gt;

Social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life.&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Sociology|first=James M.|last=Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|pages=65–67, 240|isbn=978-0-536-94185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles, they are more likely to behave in the same way, matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/factors-influencing-gender-identity/|title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language also plays a role: children, while learning a language, learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Michael, "Cultural Identity, Language Identity, Gender Identity", "The English Academy of South Africa", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social learning theory]] posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way,&lt;ref name=myers&gt;Myers, David G. (2008). ''Psychology''. New York: Worth.&lt;/ref&gt; thus being shaped by the people surrounding them through trying to imitate and follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C.

N. | last3 = Szkrybalo | first3 = J. | year = 2002 | title = Cognitive theories of early gender development | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 6| pages = 903–906 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903 | pmid=12405137| citeseerx = 10.1.1.460.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example in the nature versus nurture debate is the case of [[David Reimer]], otherwise known as "John/Joan". As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer's parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781308211503|pages=368|edition=6}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This response went against Money's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Carol |author2=Diane Ruble |author3=Joel Szkrybalo |title=Cognitive Theories of Early Gender Development |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2002 |volume=128|issue=6 |pages=903–913|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903 |pmid=12405137|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological factors===
Several prenatal, biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shuvo|title=Gender Identity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/917990-overview|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biochemical theory of gender identity suggests that people acquire gender identities through such factors rather than socialization.

Hormonal influences are also complex; [[Sexual differentiation in humans|sex-determining hormones]] are produced at an early stage of foetal development,&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke, ''In Pursuit Of Difference, scientific studies of women and men'', in ''The Gender and Science Reader'', page 310&lt;/ref&gt; and if prenatal hormone levels are altered, phenotype progression may be altered as well, and the natural predisposition of the brain toward one sex may not match the genetic make-up of the fetus or its external sexual organs.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|date=2017-02-02|title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=170–182|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006|issn=0091-3022| pmc=3296090 |pmid=21333673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hormones may affect differences between males' and females' verbal and spatial abilities, memory, and aggression; prenatal hormone exposure affects how the hypothalamus regulates hormone secretion later in life, with "women's sex hormones usually follow[ing] a monthly cycle [while] men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke suggests that during the early stage of fetal development, specific hormones will enter the brain and “permanently affect how the hypothalamus works. As before, high levels of hormones known as androgens will stop the hypothalamus from ever organizing hormone cycles. If there are low levels, then it will be cyclic.” This early influence on brain determines the different frequency of hormone secretion later in male or female’s life. “Obviously, women’s sex hormones usually follow a monthly cycle,” while “men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern.” {{cite book|last=Birke|first=Lynda|title=The Gender and Science Reader|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intersex people====
{{Main|Intersex}}
A survey of the research literature from 1955–2000 suggests that more than one in every hundred individuals may have some [[intersex]] characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200003/04)12:2&lt;151::AID-AJHB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-F| issn = 1520-6300| volume = 12| issue = 2| pages = 151–166| last1 = Blackless| first1 = Melanie| last2 = Charuvastra| first2 = Anthony| last3 = Derryck| first3 = Amanda| last4 = Fausto-Sterling| first4 = Anne| last5 = Lauzanne| first5 = Karl| last6 = Lee| first6 = Ellen| title = How sexually dimorphic are we?

A 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised [[46,XY]] persons with [[penile agenesis]], [[cloacal exstrophy]] of the bladder, or penile [[ablation]], found that 78% of the study subjects were living as female, as opposed to 22% who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=423–38 |pmid=16010465 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9 |title=Gender identity outcome in female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile ablation |last=Meyer-Bahlburg |first=HF |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study concludes: "The findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood, but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens."

A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P.

A study by Reiner &amp; Gearhart provides some insight into what can happen when genetically male children with [[cloacal exstrophy]] are sexually assigned female and raised as girls,&lt;ref name="Rosario" /&gt; according to an 'optimal gender policy' developed by [[John Money]]:&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt; in a sample of 14 children, follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12 showed that 8 of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests,&lt;ref name="Rosario"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.isna.org/node/564|title=Reiner &amp; Gearhart's NEJM Study on Cloacal Exstrophy – Review by Vernon Rosario, M.D., Ph.D|website=[[Intersex Society of North America]]|last=Rosario|first=Vernon|authorlink=Vernon Rosario}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing support for the argument that genetic variables affect gender identity and behavior independent of socialization.

Research suggests that the same hormones that promote differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity. Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth, and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oswalt |first=Angela |title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity |url=http://www.sevencounties.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=37697&amp;cn=1272 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415234240/http://www.sevencounties.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=37697&amp;cn=1272 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |publisher=Seven Countries Services, Inc. |accessdate=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and environmental factors===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

In 1955, John Money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;J. Money, J. G. Hampson, and J. L. Hampson, ''An examination of some basic sexual concepts'', 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GDDSD"&gt;A. L. C. de Vries, et al., ''Gender Dysphoria and Disorders of Sex Development'' (2013, {{ISBN|1461474418}})&lt;/ref&gt; Money's hypothesis has since been discredited,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling, ''Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construct''&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, factors such as the absence of a father, a mother's wish for a daughter, or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; with a 2004 article noting that "solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Swaab, ''Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation'', in ''Gynecological Endocrinology'', 2004: "...direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation. Solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. C. Wallien, ''Psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the attitudes of the child's parents may affect the child's gender identity, although evidence is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;M Weinraub, LP Clemens, A Sockloff, T Ethridge, ''The development of sex role stereotypes in the third year: relationships to gender labeling, gender identity, sex-types toy preference, and family characteristics'', in ''Child Development'', 1984: "Previous investigators have failed to observe a relationship between parental attitudes and children's early sex role acquisition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parental establishment of gender roles====
Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"/&gt; Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite book|last=Spade|first =Joan|title=The Kaleidoscope of Gender|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=978-1-4129-7906-1|pages= 177–184|date =2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity,&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; with Kane stating that "the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity."&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;

Many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child's sex through technology such as [[ultrasound]]. The child thus arrives to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Once the child's sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.

When considering the parents' social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class "professional" couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child's parents can shape the child's understanding of gender as well as the child's development of gender.&lt;ref name="Halpern" /&gt;

Within a study conducted by Hillary Halpern&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Hillary Paul|title=Parents' Gender Ideology and Gendered Behavior as Predictors of Children's Gender-Role Attitudes: A Longitudinal Exploration|journal=Sex Roles|volume=74|issue=11–12|pages=527–542|doi=10.1007/s11199-015-0539-0|pmid=27445431|pmc=4945126|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child's attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother's behavior was especially influential on a child's assumptions of the child's own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father's behavior and his children's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.

In recent decades it has become possible to [[sex reassignment surgery|reassign sex surgically]]. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see [[transsexual]] for some of the possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.

==History and definitions==

===Definitions===
The terms ''gender identity'' and ''core gender identity'' were first used with their current meaning — one's personal experience of one's own gender&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101"&gt;Boles, 2013. Page 101: "Gender identity is the individual's personal and private experience of his/her gender."&lt;/ref&gt; — sometime in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=GID&gt;"The term 'gender identity' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. ... gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness." {{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of the Psychology of Women and Gender'' (2004, {{ISBN|0471653578}}), page 102: "''Gender identity'' was introduced into the professional lexicon by Hooker and Stoller almost simultaneously in the early 1960s (see Money, 1985). For example, Stoller (1964) used the slightly different term ''core gender identity''..."&lt;/ref&gt; To this day they are usually used in that sense,&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the [[sexual orientation]] and [[sexual identity]] categories ''[[gay]]'', ''[[lesbian]]'' and ''[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brym, Roberts, Lie, Rytina. "Sociology". Nelson Education Ltd., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medical literature===
In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called "inverts", and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a "dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework". During the mid 1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their "correct" gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.&lt;ref name = Padawer&gt;{{cite news|last=Padawer|first=Ruth|title=What's So Bad About a Boy Who Wants to Wear a Dress?| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/magazine/whats-so-bad-about-a-boy-who-wants-to-wear-a-dress.html | accessdate = October 29, 2012|work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freud and Jung's views===
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] presented his theory of [[psychosexual development]] in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the [[phallic stage]], at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an [[Oedipus complex]] where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.&lt;ref name=myers/&gt; In 1913, [[Carl Jung]] proposed the [[Electra complex]] as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freud | first1 = Sigmund | year = 1931 | title = Female Sexuality | url = | journal = The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume = 21 | issue = | page = 229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of [[homosexuality]] (which was viewed as a [[mental disorder]] at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] for the study of [[intersex]] and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst [[Robert Stoller]] generalized many of the findings of the project in his book ''Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity'' (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term ''gender identity'' to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] in 1963. Behavioral psychologist [[John Money]] was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medical School]]'s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an [[interactionist]] theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book ''Man and Woman, Boy and Girl'' (1972) became widely used as a [[college textbook]], although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haraway |first=Donna |authorlink=Donna Haraway |year=1991 |title=Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature |page=133 |publisher=[[Free Association Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-90386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] by Katrina Karkazis, Duke University Press, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler's views===
In the late 1980s, [[Judith Butler]] began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]'', introducing the concept of [[gender performativity]] and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |year=1990 |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |pages=front/backmatter |publisher=[[Routledge Classic]] |location=London |isbn=978-0415389556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present views==

===Medical field===
{{As of|2018}}, there is some changing of views and new discrepancies about the best way to deal with gender nonconformity. Medical practitioners, as well as an increasing number of parents, generally no longer support or believe in the idea of [[conversion therapy]],&lt;ref name="nymag-7feb2016"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=How the Fight Over Transgender Kids Got a Leading Sex Researcher Fired|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html|accessdate=April 25, 2017|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now widely discredited as unethical and ineffective.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - prayer and pain"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tom Dart |title=Prayer and pain: why gay conversion therapy is still legal despite dangers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/gay-conversion-therapy-republican-party-platform |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=July 15, 2016 |ref=Prayer_and_pain |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stonewall - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conversion Therapy |url=https://www.stonewall.org.uk/campaign-groups/conversion-therapy |website=Stonewall |publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=stonewall_conversion|date=2015-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the [[NHS]], have concluded that conversion therapy to 'cure' sexual orientation is dangerous and work is being done to extend this position to include gender identity.&lt;ref name="MOU - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK |url=https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Memorandum-of-understanding-on-conversion-therapy.pdf |website=www.pyschotherapy.org |publisher=UKCP - UK Council for Psychotherapy |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=MOU_CT |date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are still a number of clinicians who continue to believe that there should be interventions for gender nonconforming children. They believe that stereotypical gender-specific toys and games will encourage children to behave in their traditional gender roles.&lt;ref name="Padawer"/&gt;

[[Transsexual]] self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their [[primary sexual characteristics]], secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, [[sex reassignment surgery]] is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|title=Sex and Gender are Different: Sexual Identity and Gender Identity are Different|journal=Clinical Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=7|issue=3|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2002-sex-and-gender.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder===
[[Gender dysphoria]] (previously called "gender identity disorder" or GID in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant [[dysphoria]] (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex:&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Identity Disorder | Psychology Today." Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness Find a Therapist. Psychology Today, 24 Oct. 2005.

The concept of gender identity appeared in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in its third edition, [[DSM-III]] (1980), in the form of two [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnoses]] of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the [[DSM-III-R]], added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.&lt;ref name="Historical Note"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zucker | first1 = KJ | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL  |date=Jan–Feb 2005 | title = Was the gender identity disorder of childhood diagnosis introduced into DSM-III as a backdoor maneuver to replace homosexuality?

The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a [[mental disorder]], speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial,&lt;ref name="Historical Note"/&gt; although the vast majority of today's mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications.

===International human rights law===
[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on the application of [[international human rights law]], provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person's deeply felt internal and individual [[experience]] of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that "Each person’s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], ''Principle 3. The Right to recognition before the law''&lt;/ref&gt; and Principle 18 states that "Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person's sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, ''Principle 18. Protection from medical abuse''&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to this principle, the "Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles" observed that "Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected [[gender expression]], have been treated as a form of [[mental illness]]. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques — including [[electroshock therapy]] — as a 'cure'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles, page 43] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf |date=November 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Yogyakarta Principles in Action" says "it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, 'gender identity' or 'gender identity disorder' often remains in consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypinaction.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Activists_Guide_English_nov_14_2010.pdf|title=Activist's Guide to the Yogyakarta Principles, p. 100|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Principles influenced the [[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]]
In 2015, gender identity was part of a Supreme Court case in the United States called Obergefell v Hodges  in which marriage was no longer restricted between man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-binary gender identities==
{{See also|Gender binary|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Some people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a [[gender binary|binary]] in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms ''non-binary'' or ''[[genderqueer]]''. Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman." These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

===Fa'afafine===
{{Main|Fa'afafine}}
In some [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies, [[fa'afafine]] are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (''see references''), fa'afafine in [[Samoa]] at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;Sua'ali'i, Tamasailau, "[[Samoa]]ns and Gender: Some Reflections on Male, Female and Fa'afafine Gender Identities", in: ''Tangata O Te Moana Nui: The Evolving Identities of Pacific Peoples in [[Aotearoa]]/[[New Zealand]]'', Palmerston North (NZ): Dunmore Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86469-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Johanna|title=Paradise Lost? Social Change and Fa'afafine in Samoa|journal=Current Sociology|date=May 2003|issue=3|pages=417–432|doi=10.1177/0011392103051003014|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Prime Minister of Samoa|Samoan Prime Minister]] is patron of the Samoa Fa'afafine Association.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_5233232"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/5233232/Transsexuals-hailed-by-Samoan-PM |title=Transsexuals hailed by Samoan PM |author=Field, Michael |date=5 July 2011 |website=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated literally, fa'afafine means "in the manner of a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Pual L. Vasey, Nancy H. Bartlett, "What Can the Samoan "Fa'afafine" Teach Us About the Western Concept of Gender Identity Disorder in Childhood?", ''Biology and Medicine'', 50.4 (2007) 481-490&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hijras===
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}
In some cultures of [[Asia]], a [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically [[male]] or [[intersex]], but some are anatomically [[female]]. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes [[prostitute]]s, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras can be compared to [[transvestism|transvestites]] or [[drag queen]]s of contemporary western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khanith===
{{Main|Khanith}}
The [[khanith]] form an accepted third gender in [[Oman]]. The khanith are [[male]] [[homosexual]] [[prostitute]]s whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at [[wedding]]s or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their [[society]], khaniths can marry women, proving their [[masculinity]] by consummating the [[marriage]]. Should a [[divorce]] or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-spirit identities===
{{Main|Two-Spirit}}
&lt;!--section needs slight expansion--&gt;
Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North American Nations]] had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond [[cisgender]] man and woman, are now often collectively termed "two-spirit" or "two-spirited." There are parts of the community that take "two-spirit" as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sarah|year=2016|title=An Introduction to the Health of Two-Spirit People: Historical, contemporary and emergent issues|url=http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|journal=National Collaborative Centre Aboriginal Health|volume=|pages=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004508/http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tutanchamon (js) 3.jpg|thumb|The [[gilding|gilded]] [[throne]] of [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] is but one of the treasures found within his tomb.]]
'''Grave goods''', in [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], are the items buried along with the body.

They are usually personal possessions, supplies to smooth the deceased's journey into the afterlife or offerings to the gods. Grave goods may be classed as a type of [[votive deposit]]. Most grave goods recovered by archaeologists consist of inorganic objects such as pottery and stone and metal tools but organic objects that have since decayed were also placed in ancient tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]], ''Death-Ritual and Social Structure in Classical Antiquity'' (Cambridge, 1992; {{ISBN|0-521-37611-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Funerary art]] is a broad term but generally means artworks made specifically to decorate a burial place, such as miniature models of possessions including slaves or servants for "use" in the afterlife.

Where grave goods appear, [[grave robbery]] is a potential problem.  [[Etruscans]] would scratch the word ''śuθina'', [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] for "from a tomb", on grave goods buried with the dead to discourage their reuse by the living.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuliano Bonfante]] and [[Larissa Bonfante]] ''The Etruscan Language: an Introduction'' (Univ. Manchester Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7190-5540-7}}); several examples collected&lt;/ref&gt;  The tomb of [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] is famous  because it was one of the few [[Egyptian tombs]] that was not thoroughly looted in ancient times.

Grave goods can be regarded as a [[sacrifice]] intended for the benefit of the deceased in the [[afterlife]]. Closely related are customs of [[ancestor worship]] and offerings to the dead, in modern western culture related to [[All Souls' Day]] ([[Day of the Dead]]), in East Asia the  "[[hell bank note]]" and related customs.
Also closely related is the custom of [[retainer sacrifice]], where servants or wives of a deceased chieftain are interred with the body.
As the inclusion of expensive grave goods and of slaves or retainers became a sign of high status in the [[Bronze Age]], the prohibitive cost led to the development of "fake" grave goods, where artwork meant to ''depict'' grave goods or retainers is produced for the burial and deposited in the grave in place of the actual sacrifice.

==History==

[[File:Urnenbestattung HH-Marmstorf Grab 216 Modell.jpg|thumb|150px|Warrior's burial from Hamburg-Marmstorf Grave]]
There are disputed claims of [[Paleolithic burial|intentional burial]] of [[Neanderthal]]s as old as 130,000 years. Similar claims have been made for early [[anatomically modern humans]] as old as 100,000 years. The earliest undisputed cases of burials are found in modern human sites of the Upper Palaeolithic.

Beads made of [[basalt]] deposited in graves in the [[Fertile Crescent]]
date to the end of the [[Upper Paleolithic]], beginning in about the 12th to 11th millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;The Earliest Beads, muma.org{{Clarify|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of grave goods are a potential indicator of the [[social stratification]] of a society. Thus, early [[Neolithic]] graves tend to show equal distribution of goods, suggesting a more or less [[classless society]], while in [[Chalcolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] burials, rich grave goods are concentrated in "[[chieftain]]" graves ([[Tumulus|barrows]]), indicating social stratification.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. William A. Haviland, Harald E. L. Prins, Dana Walrath, Bunny McBride, ''Anthropology: The Human Challenge, Cengage Learning, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-495-81084-1}}, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that burial goods indicate a level of concern and consciousness in regard to an [[afterlife]] and related sense of [[spirituality]].

==Famous grave sites==
[[File:Conical loaves of bread, Gebelein, 5th Dynasty c 2400 BC.jpg|thumb|left|[[History of bread|Conical loaves of bread]] as grave goods exactly as laid out in the Great Tomb, North Necropolis, [[Gebelein]], [[5th Dynasty]] (Old Kingdom), 2435-2305 BC. Excavations by [[Ernesto Schiaparelli]], 1911. Egyptian Museum, Turin, S. 14051-14055]]

The expression of social status in rich graves is taken to extremes in the royal graves of the Bronze Age. In the [[Theban Necropolis]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[pyramids]] and the royal graves in the [[Valley of the Kings]] are among the most elaborate burials in human history. This trend is continued into the [[Iron Age]]. An example of an extremely rich royal grave of the Iron Age is the [[Terracotta Army]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

In the sphere of the [[Roman Empire]], [[early Christianity|early Christian]] graves lack grave goods, and grave goods tend to disappear with the [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] in the 5th and 6th centuries. Similarly, the presence of grave goods in the [[Early Middle Ages]] in Europe has often been taken as evidence of [[paganism]], although during the period of conversion in [[Anglo-Saxon England]] and the [[Frankish Empire]] (7th century), the situation may be more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Geake, ''The use of grave-goods in conversion-period England, c.600-c.850'', British Archaeological Reports, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-86054-917-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Christian Middle Ages, high-status graves are marked on the exterior, with [[tomb effigy|tomb effigies]] or expensive tomb stones rather than by the presence of grave goods.{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

The practice of placing grave goods with the dead body has thus an uninterrupted history beginning in the [[Upper Paleolithic]], if not the [[Middle Paleolithic]], upheld until comparatively recent times, in many regions of the world ceasing only with [[Christianization]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

==Role in archaeology==
[[File:Copper age grave group stone wristguard copper dagger bone belt fitting sittingbourne british museum.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Copper Age]] grave group including a stone wristguard, copper dagger and bone belt fitting found at [[Sittingbourne]]]]
The importance of grave goods, from the simple behavioural and technical to the metaphysical,  in [[archaeology]] cannot be overestimated.
Because of their almost ubiquitous presence throughout the world and throughout prehistory, in many cases the excavation of every-day items placed in burials is the main source of such artifacts in a given prehistoric culture. 
However, care must be taken to avoid naive interpretation of grave goods as an objective sample of artifacts in use in a culture. Because of their ritual context, grave goods may represent a special class of artifacts, in some instances produced especially for burial. 
Artwork produced for the burial itself is known as [[funerary art]], while grave goods in the narrow sense are items produced for actual use that are placed in the grave, but in practice the two categories overlap.

Grave goods in Bronze Age and Iron Age cemeteries are a good indicator of relative [[social status]]; 
in a 2001 study on an [[Iron Age Italy|Iron Age]] cemetery in [[Pontecagnano Faiano]], Italy, a correlation was found between the quality of grave goods and  [[Forensic science|Forensic]] indicators on the skeletons, showing that skeletons in wealthy tombs tended to show substantially less evidence of biological stress during adulthood, with fewer broken bones or signs of hard labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Robb |first2=Renzo |last2=Bigazzi |first3=Luca |last3=Lazzarini |first4=Caterina |last4=Scarsini |first5=Fiorenza |last5=Sonego |title=Social status and biological status: A comparison of grave goods and skeletal indicators from Pontecagnano |journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]] |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=213–222 |year=2001 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Hamburg Dramaturgy''''' ({{lang-de|Hamburgische Dramaturgie}}) is a highly influential work on [[drama]] by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], written between 1767 and 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arons|first=Wendy|last2=Baldyga|first2=Natalya|last3=Chemers|first3=Michael M.|last4=Figal|first4=Sara|date=2014-06-30|title=The "Open-Sourced" Hamburg Dramaturgy: A Twenty-first-Century Invitation to Interact with an Eighteenth-Century Work in Progress|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548667|journal=Theatre Topics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=145–148|doi=10.1353/tt.2014.0026|issn=1086-3346}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not originally conceived as a unified and systematical book, but rather as series of essays on the theater, which Lessing wrote as commentary on the short-lived [[Hamburg National Theatre|Hamburg National Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/833404656|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing : his life, works, and thought|last=Barr)|first=Nisbet, H. B. (Hugh|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199679478|edition= 1st|location=Oxford|oclc=833404656}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of 101 short essays represents one of the first sustained critical engagements with the potential of theater as a vehicle for the advancement of humanistic discourse. In many ways, the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy'' defined the new field of [[dramaturgy]], and also introduced the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/einladung/Vorlesungen/dramatik/lessingdra.htm|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing: Hamburgische Dramaturgie (1767)|publisher=[[University of Duisburg]]|language=German|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time Lessing wrote the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy,'' there was a new movement of German theatre, based on self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Mary|title=Dramaturgy: A Revolution in Theatre|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors were beginning to perform the inner and outer lives of their characters at the same time. One of Lessing's most famous and renowned quotes from the compilation considers the responsibilities of the actor and the playwright: “The great discernment of the drama critic lies in his ability to distinguish, whenever he feels pleasure or displeasure, to what extent that feeling should be credited to the writer or to the actor”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/notice/|title=Lessing’s Preface to the "Hamburg Dramaturgy" {{!}} Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a journal with Lessing as a dramatic critic to reflect on the Hamburg National Theater's efforts was conceived by the theatre's founder [[Johann Friedrich Löwen]], and [[Abel Seyler]], "the power behind the throne," who at first reluctantly agreed, but was eventually won over by the journal's success.&lt;ref&gt;George Freedley, John A. Reeves, ''A history of the theatre'', Crown Publishers, 1968, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/833404656|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing : his life, works, and thought|last=Nisbet|first=H. B.

Topics covered by Lessing in the series of essays include Aristotle's theory of tragedy, acting theory, the role of theater in society, the means by which theater achieves its emotional effects, criticism of the actor and the play, issues of translation, and a nascent theory of the psychology of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldyga|first=Natalya|date=May 2017|title=Corporeal Eloquence and Sensate Cognition: G.

== Analysis of actors ==

The analysis of the actor, according to Lessing, is grey area for a dramaturge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/essay-101-102-103-104/|title=Essay 101, 102, 103, &amp; 104 {{!}} Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|last=|first=|date=|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|at=§17|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to know that with an actor's performance, the circumstances are a large factor to the performance, whereas, for example, the text itself is easier to judge because it simply involves literary analysis. When analyzing an actor's performance, current events, environment, and mentality of the actor must all be taken into account. When Lessing published his essays, numerous actors from Hamburg plays were upset with Lessing's carelessness and disregard of their talents in his essay.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Stegemann, “On German dramaturgy.” In The Routledge Companion to Dramturgy, ed. Magda Romanska (New York: Routledge, 2015), 45.

Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. 
In a 1976 study, Gwen Broude and Sarah Greene compared attitudes towards and frequency of homosexuality in the ethnographic studies available in the [[Standard cross-cultural sample]]. They found that out of 42 communities: homosexuality was accepted or ignored in 9; 5 communities had no concept of homosexuality; 11 considered it undesirable but did not set punishments; and 17 strongly disapproved and punished. Of 70 communities, homosexuality was reported to be absent or rare in frequency in 41, and present or not uncommon in 29.&lt;ref&gt;Gwen J. Broude and Sarah J. Greene, "Cross-Cultural Codes on Twenty Sexual Attitudes and Practices", ''Ethnology'', Vol. 15, No. 4 (Oct., 1976), pp. 409-429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broude, Gwen J., and Sarah J. Greene, (1980).

Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was frequent in ancient Greece. However, in later cultures influenced by [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Sodomy law#History|law]] and the [[Christianity and homosexuality#History of Christianity and homosexuality|church]] established [[sodomy]] as a transgression against divine law or a [[crime against nature]].

Many historical figures, including [[Socrates]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Homosexuality'', Craig Arthur Williams, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; have had terms such as ''gay'' or ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'' applied to them; some scholars, such as [[Michel Foucault]], have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary [[social construct]] of sexuality foreign to their times,&lt;ref name="foucault"&gt;{{harv|Foucault|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others challenge this.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, Review of David M. Halperin, ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality.'' in ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]'' 2003.09.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. [[John Boswell]] has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=boswell1&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Boswell |date=1980 |title=Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century |location=Chicago |publisher=The University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.

Among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] prior to European colonization, a number of Nations had respected ceremonial and social roles for homosexual, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming individuals in their communities; in many contemporary [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] communities, these roles still exist.&lt;ref name=Estrada&gt;Estrada, Gabriel S. 2011.

Homosexual and gender-variant individuals were also common among other pre-[[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquest]] civilizations in [[Latin America]], such as the [[Aztec]]s, [[Maya civilization|Mayans]], [[Quechuas]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]]s, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], and the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] of Brazil.&lt;ref name=glbtqlatinamerica&gt;{{citation|first=Ben |last=Pablo |year=2004 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/latin_america_colonial.html |title=Latin America: Colonial |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211012339/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/latin_america_colonial.html |archivedate=2007-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glbtqmex&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Murray |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen O.

[[File:Balboamurder.jpg|thumb|left|Balboa setting his [[war dog]]s upon Indian practitioners of sodomy in 1513; New York Public Library]]
The Spanish conquerors were horrified to discover sodomy openly practiced among native peoples, and attempted to crush it out by subjecting the ''[[Two-Spirit|berdache]]s'' (as the Spanish called them) under their rule to severe penalties, including public [[execution]], burning and being torn to pieces by dogs.&lt;ref name=coello&gt;Mártir de Anglería, Pedro.

==East Asia==
In [[East Asia]], same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history.

[[Homosexuality in China]], known as the ''pleasures of the bitten peach,'' ''the cut sleeve,'' or ''the southern custom,'' has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. These euphemistic terms were used to describe behaviors, not identities (recently some fashionable young Chinese tend to euphemistically use the term "brokeback," 斷背 ''duanbei'' to refer to homosexual men, from the success of director [[Ang Lee]]'s film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'').&lt;ref name=jongo&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.jongo.com/articles/07/0820/30157/MzAxNTcoluZIoia.html |title=Most frequently used new coinages in daily Chinese |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-07 |periodical=Jongo News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011175158/http://news.jongo.com/articles/07/0820/30157/MzAxNTcoluZIoia.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships were marked by differences in age and social position. However, the instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' seem as familiar to observers in the present, as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period.

[[Homosexuality in Japan#Ancient Japan|Homosexuality in Japan]], variously known as [[shudo]] or [[nanshoku]], has been documented for over one thousand years and had some connections to the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic life and the [[samurai]] tradition. This same-sex love culture gave rise to strong traditions of [[Ukiyo-e|painting]] and literature documenting and celebrating such relationships.

Similarly, in [[Thailand]], ''[[kathoey]]'', or "ladyboys," have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries, and Thai kings had male as well as female lovers. While ''kathoey'' may encompass simple [[effeminacy]] or [[transvestite|transvestism]], it most commonly is treated in [[Thai culture]] as a [[third gender]]. They are generally accepted by society, and Thailand has never had legal prohibitions against homosexuality or homosexual behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The earliest Western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, and [[Greek mythology|mythographic materials]]) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]].

The formal practice, an erotic yet often restrained relationship between a free-born (i.e. not a slave or [[freedman]]) adult male and a free-born [[adolescent]], was valued for its [[pedagogy|pedagogic benefits]] and as a means of [[population control]], though occasionally blamed for causing [[societal disorder|disorder]]. [[Plato]] praised its benefits in his early writings&lt;ref name=plato1&gt;[[Plato]], Phaedrus in the ''[[Symposium]]''&lt;/ref&gt; but in his late works proposed its prohibition.&lt;ref name=plato2&gt;Plato, Laws, 636D &amp; 835E&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Symposium'' (182B-D), Plato equates acceptance of homosexuality with [[democracy]], and its suppression with [[despotism]], saying that homosexuality "is shameful to [[barbarian]]s because of their despotic governments, just as [[philosophy]] and [[athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] are, since it is apparently not in best interests of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or physical unions, all of which love is particularly apt to produce".&lt;ref name=boswell1/&gt;

Aristotle, in his ''Politics'', dismissed Plato's ideas about abolishing homosexuality (2.4); he explains that barbarians like the [[Celt]]s accorded it a special honour (2.6.6), while the [[Cretan]]s used it to regulate the population (2.7.5).&lt;ref name=boswell1/&gt;

Little is known of [[lesbianism|female homosexuality]] in [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. [[Sappho]], born on the island of [[Lesbos]], was included by later [[Classical Greek people|Greeks]] in the canonical list of [[nine lyric poets]]. The adjectives deriving from her name and place of birth (''sapphic'' and ''lesbian'') came to be applied to female homosexuality beginning in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lesbian&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lesbian|title=Lesbian|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sapphic&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Sapphic|title=Sapphic|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sappho's poetry centers on [[passion (emotion)|passion]] and love for various personages and both genders. The [[narrator]]s of many of her poems speak of [[infatuation]]s and love (sometimes requited, sometimes not) for various females, but descriptions of [[sexual act|physical acts]] between women are few and subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;Denys Page, ''Sappho and Alcaeus'', Oxford UP, 1959, pp. 142–146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that she ran an academy for girls.

In [[ancient Rome]], the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention, but [[pederasty|relationships]] were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex.&lt;ref&gt;Prioreschi, Plinio (1996). A History of Medicine. Horatius Press. pp. 21–23, 29. {{ISBN|1-888456-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Every [[Roman emperor|emperor]] with the exception of [[Claudius]] took male lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward (1781). The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenophile]] emperor [[Hadrian]] is renowned for his relationship with [[Antinous]]. However, by 390 A.D., Emperor [[Theodosius I]] made homosexuality a legally punishable offense for the passive partner: "All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people." &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Robert Thornton, Bowers v. Hardrick: An Incomplete Constitutional Analysis, 65 U.N.C. L. Rev. 1100, 1100 n. 11 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; In 558, toward the end of his reign, [[Justinian I|Justinian]] expanded the proscription to the active partner as well, warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the "[[Divine retribution|wrath of God]]". Notwithstanding these regulations, taxes on [[brothels]] of boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected until the end of the reign of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] in 618.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius: Secret History: XIX.

During the [[Renaissance]], wealthy cities in northern [[Italy]]—[[Florence]] and [[Venice]] in particular—were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rocke, Michael, (1996), ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', {{ISBN|0-19-512292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Guido, (1985), ''The Boundaries of Eros'', {{ISBN|0-19-503465-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even as many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the aegis of the [[Officers of the Night]], were [[prosecution|prosecuting]], [[fine (penalty)|fining]], and [[imprisonment|imprisoning]] a good portion of that population.&lt;ref&gt;Florentine proverb, ca. 1480. After Sabadino degli Arienti in Le Porretane. Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', Oxford, 1996; p.87&lt;/ref&gt; The eclipse of this period of relative [[artistic freedom|artistic]] and [[sexual freedom|erotic freedom]] was precipitated by the rise to power of the moralizing monk [[Girolamo Savonarola]].&lt;ref&gt;On homoeroticism in Florence and Savonarola's campaign against it, Michael Rocke, Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence (New York, 1996). More generally, on youth culture, see Richard Trexler, Public Life in Renaissance Florence (New York, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships of socially prominent figures, such as [[Personal relationships of James I of England|King James I]] and the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], served to highlight the issue, including in anonymously authored street pamphlets: "The world is chang'd I know not how, For men Kiss Men, not Women now;...Of J. the First and Buckingham: He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled, To slabber his lov'd Ganimede" &lt;ref&gt;''Mundus Foppensis, or The Fop Display'd'', 1691&lt;/ref&gt;

The anonymous ''Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson'' was published in 1723 in England and was presumed by some modern scholars to be a novel.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. "Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson." ''Issue 2; Issue 19 of Journal of Homosexuality Series: No. 19, N''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1749 edition of [[John Cleland]]'s popular novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' includes a homosexual scene, but this was removed in its 1750 edition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Fanny_Hill:_Memoirs_of_a_Woman_of_Pleasure ''Fanny Hill'' at WikiSource] (1749) by [[John Cleland]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gertz, Stephen J.

Retrieved 15 July. 2017. &lt;http://www.booktryst.com/2012/10/the-wages-of-sin-80000-for-rare-fanny.html?m=1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1749, the earliest extended and serious defense of homosexuality in English, ''Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified'', written by [[Thomas Cannon]], was published, but was suppressed almost immediately. It includes the passage: "Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts."&lt;ref&gt;Gladfelder, Hal (May 2006) ''In Search of Lost Texts: Thomas Cannon's 'Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified"'', Institute of Historical Research&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1785 [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote another defense, but this was not published until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Homosexuality ({{ISSN|0091-8369}}) Volume: 3 Issue: 4, Volume: 4 Issue: 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Execution]]s for sodomy continued in the [[Netherlands]] until 1803 and in [[England]] until 1835.

Between 1864 and 1880 [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] published a series of twelve tracts, which he collectively titled ''Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love.'' In 1867 he became the first self-proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the [[Congress of German Jurists]] in [[Munich]] for a resolution urging the repeal of [[anti-homosexual law]]s. ''Sexual Inversion'' by [[Havelock Ellis]], published in 1896, challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as stereotypes, and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement.&lt;ref name=sexualinversion&gt;{{citation |title=Sexual Inversion |first=Havelock |last=Ellis |first2=John Addington |last2=Symonds |year=1975 |publisher=Arno Press |isbn=0-405-07363-1}} (reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[medical text]]s like these (written partly in [[Latin]] to obscure the sexual details) were not widely read by the general public, they did lead to the rise of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], which campaigned from 1897 to 1933 against [[Paragraph 175|anti-sodomy laws in Germany]], as well as a much more informal, unpublicized movement among British intellectuals and writers, led by such figures as [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Addington Symonds]]. Beginning in 1894 with ''Homogenic Love'', [[Socialist]] activist and poet [[Edward Carpenter]] wrote a string of pro-homosexual articles and pamphlets, and "came out" in 1916 in his book ''My Days and Dreams''. In 1900, [[Elisar von Kupffer]] published an [[anthology]] of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time, ''[[Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur]]''. His aim was to broaden the public perspective of homosexuality beyond its being viewed simply as a medical or biological issue, but also as an ethical and cultural one. In a backlash to this, the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] specifically [[History of gays in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|targeted LGBT people in the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Heger: ''Die Männer mit dem rosa Winkel.''

There are a handful of accounts by Arab travelers to Europe during the mid-1800s. Two of these travelers, Rifa'ah al-Tahtawi and Muhammad sl-Saffar, show their surprise that the French sometimes deliberately mis-translated love poetry about a young boy, instead referring to a young female, to maintain their social norms and morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Rouayheb|first=Khaled|title=Before Homosexuality in the Arab-Islamic World, 1500-1800|year=2005|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-72988-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many [[Middle East]]ern [[Muslim]] cultures egalitarian or age-structured homosexual practices were, and remain, widespread and thinly veiled. The prevailing pattern of same-sex relationships in the temperate and sub-tropical zone stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the relationships were—and are—either gender-structured or age-structured or both. In recent years, egalitarian relationships modeled on the western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare. Same-sex intercourse officially carries the death penalty in several Muslim nations: Saudi Arabia, Iran, [[Mauritania]], northern [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 ILGA:7 countries still put people to death for same-sex acts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029185853/http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 |date=2009-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, governments in the Middle East often ignore, deny the existence of, or criminalize homosexuality. Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], during his [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad#U.S. Visit and speech at Columbia University|2007 speech at Columbia University]], asserted that there were no gay people in Iran.

In many societies of [[Melanesia]], especially in [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture until the middle of the last century. The [[Etoro people|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, even viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would "inseminate" him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty. Many Melanesian societies, however, have become hostile towards same-sex relationships since the introduction of [[Christianity]] by [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[missionaries]].&lt;ref name=melanesia&gt;{{citation |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08096-3 |pages=128–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mastaba of Niankhkhum and Khnumhotep embrace.jpg|thumb|Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep kissing.]]
[[Homosexuality in ancient Egypt]] is a passionately disputed subject within [[Egyptology]]: historians and egyptologists alike debate what kind of view the Ancient Egyptians society fostered about [[homosexuality]]. Only a handful of direct hints have survived to this day and many possible indications are only vague and offer plenty of room for speculation.

The best known case of possible homosexuality in Ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials [[Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum|Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep]]. Both men lived and served under [[pharaoh]] [[Niuserre]] during the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|5th Dynasty]] (c. 2494&amp;ndash;2345 BC).&lt;ref name=RPH&gt;Richard Parkinson: ''Homosexual Desire and Middle Kingdom Literature''. In: ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (JEA)'', vol. 81, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same [[mastaba]] tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in Ancient Egypt the [[Eskimo kissing|nose-on-nose touching]] normally represented a kiss.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

Egyptologists and historians disagree about how to interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the Ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101020071548/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/africa/niankhkhnum_and_khnumhotep.html Dena Connors-Millard: ''Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep - Evidence of Gay Relationships Exists as Early as 2400 B.C.?''] (English).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were [[twin]]s, even possibly [[conjoined twins]]. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show at the very least that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

It remains unclear, what exact view the Ancient Egyptians fostered about homosexuality. Any document and literature that actually contains sexual orientated stories, never name the nature of the sexual deeds, but instead uses stilted and flowery paraphrases. While the stories about Seth and his sexual behavior may reveal rather negative thoughts and views, the tomb inscription of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep may instead suggest that homosexuality was likewise accepted. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. And no Ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were set under penalty. Thus, a straight evaluation remains problematic.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=EBT&gt;Emma Brunner-Traut: ''Altägyptische Märchen. Mythen und andere volkstümliche Erzählungen''. 10th Edition. Diederichs, Munich 1991, {{ISBN|3-424-01011-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century [[Mwanga II]] (1868–1903) the Kabaka of Buganda regularly had sex with his male page.&lt;ref&gt;"Long-Distance Trade and Foreign Contact". Uganda. Library of Congress Country Studies. December 1990. Retrieved 6 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ethiopia Bieber (1909) “encountered Uranism” among the Semitic Harari people and noted that “sodomy is not foreign to the Harari. Albeit not as commonly, it also occurs among the Galla [Oromo] and Somal[i].” He also noted mutual masturbation by both sexes and all ages for all three peoples, and specified that among the Harari, Uranism was practiced as often between
men as between men and boys. More recently, Gamst (1969) reported homosexual relations among shepherd boys of the Cushitic-speaking Qemant (Kemant) of central Ethiopia. Among Amhara peasants, Messing (1957) found (better-accepted) male transvestites, who they view as “god’s mistakes.” Wändarwäräd (“literally male-female”) with visible male sexual characteristics, but whose structure is popularly believed to be defective. Among the Maale of southern Ethiopia, “a small minority [of men] crossed over to feminine roles. Called ashtime, these (biological) males dressed like women, performed female tasks, cared for their own houses, and apparently had sexual relations with men,” according to Donald Donham (1990).

Cross-gender homosexuality not tied to possession cults has been reported in a number of East African societies. Needham (1973) described a religious leadership role called mugawe among the Meru of Kenya which includes wearing women's clothes and hairstyle. Mugawe are frequently homosexual, and sometimes are married to a man. Bryk (1964) reported active (i.e., insertive)
Kikuyu pederasts called onek. and also mentioned “homoerotic bachelors” among the pastoralist Nandi and Maragoli (Wanga).

== Historiographic considerations ==
The term ''homosexuality'' was invented in the 19th century, with the term ''heterosexuality''  invented later in the same century to contrast with the earlier term. The term ''bisexuality'' was invented in the 20th century as sexual identities became defined by the predominate sex to which people are attracted and thus a label was needed for those who are not predominantly attracted to one sex. This points out that the history of sexuality is not solely the history of different-sex sexuality plus the history of same-sex sexuality, but a broader conception viewing of historical events in light of our modern concept or concepts of sexuality taken at its most broad and/or literal definitions.

Historical personalities are often described using modern sexual identity terms such as ''straight'', ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'', ''[[gay]]'' or ''[[queer]]''. Those who favour the practice say that this can highlight such issues as discriminatory historiography by, for example, putting into relief the extent to which same-sex sexual experiences are excluded from biographies of noted figures, or to which sensibilities resulting from same-sex attraction are excluded from literary and artistic consideration of important works, and so on. As well as that, an opposite situation is possible in the modern society: some LGBT-supportive researchers stick to the homosexual theories, excluding other possibilities.

However, many, especially in the academic world, regard the use of modern labels as problematic, owing to differences in the ways that different societies constructed sexual orientation identities and to the connotations of modern words like ''queer''. For example, in many societies same-sex sex acts were expected, or completely ignored, and no identity was constructed on their basis at all. Academic works usually specify which words will be used and in which context. Readers are cautioned to avoid making assumptions about the identity of historical figures based on the use of the terms mentioned above.

=== Ancient Greece ===
{{Main|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Pederasty in ancient Greece}}
Greek men had great latitude in their sexual expression, but their wives were severely restricted and could hardly move about the town unsupervised if she was old enough that people would ask whose mother she was, not whose wife she was.

Men could also seek adolescent boys as partners as shown by some of the earliest documents concerning same-sex [[pederasty|pederastic]] relationships, which come from [[Ancient Greece]]. Often adolescent boys were favored over women. One ancient saying claimed that "Women are for business, boys are for pleasure." Though slave boys could be bought, free boys had to be courted, and ancient materials suggest that the father also had to consent to the relationship. Such relationships did not replace marriage between man and woman, but occurred before and during the marriage. A mature man would not usually have a mature male mate, but there were exceptions (among whom [[Alexander the Great]]) He would be the ''erastes'' (lover) to a young ''eromenos'' (loved one). Dover suggests that it was considered improper for the eromenos to feel desire, as that would not be masculine. Driven by desire and admiration, the erastes would devote himself unselfishly by providing all the education his eromenos required to thrive in society. In recent times, Dover's theory suggests that [[#Outside Reading|questioned]] in light of massive evidence of ancient art and love poetry, a more emotional connection than earlier researchers liked to acknowledge. Some research has shown that ancient Greeks believed semen to be the source of knowledge and that these relationships served to pass wisdom on from the erastes to the eromenos.

=== Ancient Rome ===
{{Main|Sexuality in ancient Rome|Homosexuality in ancient Rome}}
The "conquest mentality" of the [[ancient Romans]] shaped Roman homosexual practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xi; Marilyn B. Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Republic]], a [[Roman citizenship|citizen]]'s political liberty was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion or use by others;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; for the male citizen to submit his body to the giving of pleasure was considered servile.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a man played the penetrative role, it was socially acceptable and considered natural for him to have [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male–male sex|same-sex relations]], without a perceived loss of his [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|masculinity or social standing]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225, and "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex between male citizens of equal status, including [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex in the military|soldiers]], was disparaged, and in some circumstances penalized harshly.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Elise Phang, ''Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' 288a; Thomas Habinek, "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," in ''The Roman Cultural Revolution'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 39; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 545–546. Scholars disagree as to whether the ''Lex Scantinia'' imposed the death penalty or a hefty fine.&lt;/ref&gt; Male [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]], and entertainers or others considered ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'' (of no social standing) were acceptable sex partners for the dominant male citizen to penetrate.

"Homosexual" and "heterosexual" were thus not categories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]], and no words exist in [[Latin]] that would precisely translate these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; A male citizen who willingly performed [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|oral sex]] or received [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|anal sex]] was disparaged. In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Effeminacy and transvestism|effeminacy]] and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at "democratic" politicians ''([[populares]])'' such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Mark Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Roman Empire]] came under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia: Three Types of Explanation," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against men who were presumably "homosexual" in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 214–215; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Middle Ages ===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Two males accused of sodomy burned at the stake, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]
Through the medieval period, homosexuality was generally condemned and thought to be the moral of the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. Historians debate if there were any prominent homosexuals and bisexuals at this time, but it is argued that figures such as [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], [[Richard the Lionheart]], [[Philip II Augustus]], and [[William Rufus]] were engaged in same-sex relationships.

Also, historian Allan A. Tulchin recently argued that a form of male same-sex marriage existed in Medieval France, and possibly other areas in Europe, as well. There was a legal category called "enbrotherment" (affrèrement) that allowed two men to share living quarters, pool their resources, and effectively live as a married couple. The couple shared "one bread, one wine, one purse."&lt;ref&gt;Allan A. Tulchin, "Same-Sex Couples Creating Households in Old Regime France: The Uses of the Affrèrement," ''The Journal of Modern History''. Volume 79, Issue 3, Page 613–647, Sep 2007. [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/action/doSearch?searchText=tulchin&amp;filter=all&amp;x=0&amp;y=0]&lt;/ref&gt; The article received considerable attention in the English-language press, since Tulchin may have discovered the earliest form of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph {{cite web|url=http://my.telegraph.co.uk/go/tag/view/blog_post/humanity?num=10&amp;pg=3|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126082839/http://my.telegraph.co.uk/go/tag/view/blog_post/humanity?num=10&amp;pg=3|archivedate=2009-01-26|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-06-18|df=}}, NPR [https://www.npr.org/blogs/news/2007/08/could_the_idea_of_civil_unions.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Tulchin's views have also sparked significant controversy, as they challenge the generally held view that the medieval period was one of the most anti-gay in history.

== Psychiatry ==
Freud, among others, argued that neither predominantly different- nor same-sex sexuality were the norm, instead that what is called "bisexuality" is the normal human condition thwarted by society.

In 1948 [[Alfred Kinsey]] publishes ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'', popularly known as the [[Kinsey Reports]].

Homosexuality was deemed to be a psychiatric disorder for many years, although the studies this theory was based on were later determined to be flawed. In 1973 homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1986 all references to homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder were removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

== The sexual revolution ==
During the [[Sexual Revolution]], the different-sex sexual ideal became completely separated from procreation, yet at the same time was distanced from same-sex sexuality. Many people viewed this freeing of different-sex sexuality as leading to more freedom for same-sex sexuality.

In [[linguistics]] and [[pedagogy]], an '''interlinear gloss''' is a [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] (series of brief explanations, such as definitions or pronunciations) placed between lines (''[[wikt:inter-#Prefix|inter-]]'' + ''[[wikt:linear#Adjective|linear]]''), such as between a line of original text and its [[translation]] into another [[language]]. When glossed, each line of the original text acquires one or more lines of transcription known as an '''interlinear text''' or '''interlinear glossed text''' ('''IGT'''){{mdash}}'''interlinear''' for short. Such glosses help the reader follow the relationship between the [[source text]] and its translation, and the structure of the original language. In its simplest form, an interlinear gloss is simply a literal, word-for-word translation of the [[source text]].

==History==
[[File:Toussaint-Langenscheidt Spanisch 7.13.png|thumb|Interlinear text in ''Toussaint-Langenscheidt Spanisch'', a [[Spanish language]] textbook for [[German language|German]] speakers, 1910.]]
Interlinear glosses have been used for a variety of purposes over a long period of time. One common usage has been to annotate bilingual textbooks for language education. This sort of interlinearization serves to help make the meaning of a [[source text]] explicit without attempting to formally model the structural characteristics of the source language.

Such annotations have occasionally been expressed not through interlinear layout, but rather, through enumeration of words in the object and meta language. One such example is [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s annotation of [[Classical Nahuatl]]:&lt;ref name=lehmann2004directions/&gt;

{| style="line-height: 80%;"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || 1   || 2  || 3      || 4    || 5  || 6   || 7       || 8  || 9
|-
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || ni- || c- || chihui || -lia || in || no- || piltzin || ce || calli
|-
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || 1   || 3     || 2  || 4   || 5   || 6    || 7    || 8   || 9
|-
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || ich || mache || es || für || der || mein || Sohn || ein || Haus
|}

This "inline" style allows examples to be included within the flow of text, and for the word order of the target language to be written in an order which approximates the target language syntax. (In the gloss here, ''mache es'' is reordered from the corresponding source order to approximate German syntax more naturally.) Even so, this approach requires the readers to "re-align" the correspondences between source and target forms.

More modern 19th and 20th-century approaches took to glossing vertically, aligning the same sort of word-by-word content in such a way that the metalanguage terms were placed vertically below the source language terms. In this style, the given example might be rendered thus (here English gloss):

:{{interlinear| lang = nci
| ni- c- chihui -lia in no- piltzin ce calli
| I it make for to-the my son a house
|"I made my son a house."}}

Note that here word ordering is determined by the syntax of the object language.

Finally, modern linguists have adopted the practice of using abbreviated grammatical category labels. A 2008 publication which repeats this example labels it as follows:&lt;ref name=haspelmath2008handbook/&gt;

:{{interlinear| lang = nci
|ni-c-chihui-lia in no-piltzin ce calli
|1SG.SUBJ-3SG.OBJ-mach-APPL DET 1SG.POSS-Sohn ein Haus|}}

This approach is denser and also requires effort to read, but it is less reliant on the grammatical structure of the metalanguage for expressing the semantics of the target forms.

In computing, special text markers are provided in [[Specials (Unicode block)]] to indicate the start and end of interlinear glosses.

==Structure==

A semi-standardized set of parsing conventions and grammatical abbreviations is explained in the [[Leipzig Glossing Rules]].&lt;ref name=leipzigRules/&gt;

An interlinear text will commonly consist of some or all of the following, usually in this order, from top to bottom: 
*The original [[orthography]] (typically in ''italic'' or '''''bold italic'''''), 
*a conventional transliteration into the Latin alphabet,
*a [[phonetic]] transcription, 
*a [[morphophonemic]] transliteration,
*a word-by-word or [[morpheme]]-by-morpheme gloss, where morphemes within a word are separated by hyphens or other punctuation,
and finally 
*a free translation, which may be placed in a separate paragraph or on the facing page if the structures of the languages are too different for it to follow the text line by line.

As an example, the following [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]] clause has been transcribed with five lines of text: 
:1. the standard ''[[pe̍h-ōe-jī]]'' transliteration, 
:2. a gloss using [[tone number]]s for the surface tones, 
:3. a gloss showing the underlying tones in citation form (before undergoing [[tone sandhi]]), 
:4. a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss in [[English language|English]], and 
:5. an English translation:&lt;ref&gt;Example from ''A Basic Vocabulary for a Beginner in Taiwanese'' by Ko Chek Hoan and Tan Pang Tin&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{interlinear|italics1=yes|italics2=yes|italics3=yes|glossing2=no
|{{noitalic|(1.)}} goá iáu-boē koat-tēng tang-sî boeh tńg-khì
|{{noitalic|(2.)}} goa1 iau1-boe3 koat2-teng3 tang7-si5 boeh2 tng1-khi3.
|{{noitalic|(3.)}} goa2 iau2-boe7 koat4-teng7 tang1-si5 boeh4 tng2-khi3.
|(4.) I not-yet decide when want return.
|(5.) "I have not yet decided when I shall return."}}
In linguistics, it has become standard to align the words and to gloss each transcribed [[morpheme]] separately. That is, ''koat-tēng'' in line 1 above would either require a hyphenated two-word gloss, or be transcribed without a hyphen, for example as ''koattēng.'' Grammatical terms are commonly abbreviated and printed in {{small|SMALL CAPITALS}} to keep them distinct from translations, especially when they are frequent or important for analysis. Varying levels of analysis may be detailed. For example, in a [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]] text using standard romanization,&lt;ref&gt;Haspelmath 1993:207&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{interlinear|glossing = link| lang = lez
|Gila abur-u-n ferma hamišaluǧ güǧüna amuqʼ-da-č
|now they-OBL-GEN farm forever behind stay-FUT-NEG
|'Now their farm will not stay behind forever.'}}

Here every Lezgian morpheme is set off with hyphens and glossed separately. Since many of these are difficult to gloss in English, the [[root word|roots]] are translated, but the grammatical suffixes are glossed with three-letter grammatical abbreviations.

The same text may be glossed at a different level of analysis:

:{{interlinear| lang = lez
|Gila aburun ferma hamišaluǧ güǧüna amuqʼ-da-č
|now their.OBL farm forever behind stay-will-not
|'Now their farm will not stay behind forever.'}}

Here the Lezgian morphemes are translated into English as much as possible; only those which correspond to English are set off with hyphens.

A more colloquial gloss would be:

:{{interlinear| lang = lez
|Gila aburun ferma hamišaluǧ güǧüna amuqʼdač
|now their farm forever behind won't.stay
|'Now their farm will not stay behind forever.'}}

Here the gloss is word for word; rather than setting off Lezgian morphemes with hyphens, the English words in the gloss are joined with periods when more than one is required to translate a Lezgian word.

==Punctuation==
In interlinear morphological glosses, various forms of punctuation separate the glosses. Typically, the words are aligned with their glosses; within words, a hyphen is used when a boundary is marked in both the text and its gloss, a period when a boundary appears in only one. That is, there should be the same number of words separated with spaces in the text and its gloss, as well as the same number of hyphenated morphemes within a word and its gloss. This is the basic system, and can be applied universally. For example,

:{{interlinear| lang = tr| glossing = link
|top = ''Odadan hızla çıktım.'' (Turkish) 
|oda-dan hız-la çık-tı-m
|room-ABL speed-COM go.out-PFV-1sg
|room-from speed-with go_out-perfective-I
|'I left the room quickly.'}}

An underscore may be used instead of a period, as in ''go_out-{{small|PFV}}'', when a single word in the source language happens to correspond to a phrase in the glossing language, though a period would still be used for other situations, such as Greek ''oikíais'' house.{{small|FEM.PL.DAT}} 'to the houses'.

However, sometimes finer distinctions may be made. For example, [[clitic]]s may be separated with a double hyphen (or, for ease of typing, an equal sign) rather than a hyphen:

:{{interlinear| lang = fr
|top = ''Je t'aime.'' (French)
|je{{=}}te{{=}}aime
|I{{=}}you{{=}}love
|'I love you.'}} 

Affixes which case discontinuity ([[infix]]es, [[circumfix]]es, transfixes, etc.) may be set off by angle brackets, and [[reduplication]] with tildes, rather than with hyphens:

:{{interlinear|tone-superscripting = no| lang  = tl
|top = sulat, susulat, sumulat, sumusulat (verbal declensions) (Tagalog) 
|sulat su~sulat s{{infix|um}}ulat s{{infix|um}}u~sulat
|write [[contemplative mood]]~write {{infix|[[agent trigger]].past}}write {{infix|agent{{nbsp}}trigger}}contemplative~write
|}}
(See [[affix]] for other examples.)

Morphemes which cannot be easily separated out, such as [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]], may be marked with a backslash rather than a period:

:{{interlinear
|unser-n Väter-n| c1 = (German)
|our-DAT.PL father\PL-DAT.PL
|'to our fathers' (the singular of ''Väter'' 'fathers' is ''Vater'')}}

A few other conventions which are sometimes seen are illustrated in the Leipzig Glossing Rules.&lt;ref name=leipzigRules/&gt;

[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s, that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies."&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people face stigmatisation and discrimination from birth, particularly when an intersex variation is visible. In some countries (particularly in Africa and Asia) this may include [[infanticide]], abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in [[East Africa]] may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a [[curse]].&lt;ref name="cschrcl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbkci2015"/&gt;

Intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, may be surgically and/or hormonally altered to fit perceived more socially-acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes.&lt;ref name="apeg2013"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=aafe43f3-c6a2-4525-ad16-15e4210ee0ac&amp;subId=16191 | title = Submission 88 to the Australian Senate inquiry on the involuntary or coerced sterilisation of people with disabilities in Australia | work = Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group (APEG) | date = 27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such treatments may involve sterilization.

Implementation of human rights protections in legislation and regulation has progressed more slowly. In 2011, [[Christiane Völling]] won the first successful case brought against a surgeon for non-consensual surgical intervention.&lt;ref name="voll" /&gt; In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] recognized for the first time a right for intersex persons to ''not'' undergo sex assignment treatment.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw nonconsensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Reuters| title = Surgery and Sterilization Scrapped in Malta's Benchmark LGBTI Law| work = The New York Times| date = 1 April 2015| url = https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/04/01/world/europe/01reuters-gay-rights-malta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Star Observer| authorlink = Star Observer | title = Malta passes law outlawing forced surgical intervention on intersex minors| work = Star Observer| date = 2 April 2015| url = http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/international-news-news/malta-passes-law-outlawing-forced-surgical-intervention-on-intersex-minors/134800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other human rights and legal issues include the right to life, protection from discrimination, access to justice and reparations, access to information, and legal recognition.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt; Few countries so far protect intersex people from discrimination, or provide access to reparations for harmful practices.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

==Intersex and human rights==
[[File:ILGA conference 2018 Intersex Awareness Day group photo.jpg|thumb|300px|ILGA conference 2018, group photo to mark [[Intersex Awareness Day]]]]
Research indicates a growing consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal—if relatively rare—forms of human biology,&lt;ref name=Zderic&gt;{{cite book|first=  Stephen |last = Zderic|title=Pediatric gender assignment : a critical reappraisal ; [proceedings from a conference ... in Dallas in the spring of 1999 which was entitled "pediatric gender assignment - a critical reappraisal"]|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Acad. / Plenum Publ.|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=978-0306467592}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on medical practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. A 2013 first international pilot study. [[Human Rights between the Sexes]], by [[Dan Christian Ghattas]],&lt;ref name="ghattas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | title = Human Rights Between the Sexes | first1 = Dan Christian | last1 = Ghattas | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] | date = September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | title = A preliminary study on the life situations of inter* individuals | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide:
{{quotation|Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society.}}

The [[Council of Europe]] highlights several areas of concern:

* unnecessary "normalising" treatment of intersex persons, and unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics.
* unnecessary medicalisation is said to also impact a right to life.
* inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law; facilitating access to justice and reparations.
* access to information, medical records, peer and other counselling and support.
* respecting self-determination in gender recognition, through expeditious access to official documents.&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = [[Council of Europe]]| last2 = Commissioner for Human Rights| title = Human rights and intersex people, Issue Paper| date = April 2015| url = https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH/IssuePaper(2015)1&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights remains slow. These actions take place through legislation, regulation and court cases, detailed below.

=== "Pinkwashing" ===
{{main|Intersex and LGBT}}
Multiple organizations have highlighted appeals to LGBT rights recognition that fail to address the issue of unnecessary "normalising" treatments on intersex children, using the portmanteau term "[[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]". In June 2016, [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments, suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBTI (LGBT and intersex) people are recognized while, at the same time, harmful practices on intersex children continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Submission: list of issues for Australia's Convention Against Torture review | url = https://oii.org.au/30546/loi-cat-review/ | work = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] | date = June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, [[Zwischengeschlecht]] described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning "intersex genital mutilations" as a form of [[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Intersex legislation" that allows the daily mutilations to continue = PINKWASHING of IGM practices | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TRANSCRIPTION &gt; UK Questioned over Intersex Genital Mutilations by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Gov Non-Answer + Denial | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people face stigmatisation and discrimination from birth. In some countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, this may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families.

Non-consensual medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people take place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been explored.&lt;ref name="ghattas" /&gt; Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions. In low and middle income countries, the cost of healthcare may limit access to necessary medical treatment at the same time that other individuals experience coercive medical interventions.&lt;ref name="bbkci2015" /&gt;

Several rights have been stated as affected by stigmatization and coercive medical interventions on minors:
* the [[right to life]].&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;
* the [[right to privacy]], including a right to personal [[autonomy]] or self-determination regarding medical treatment.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt;

===Human rights reports===
[[File:Small Ela Luk.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong intersex activist [[Small Luk]]]]
{{further|Intersex human rights reports}}
These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions. In 2012, the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics reported.&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt; In 2013, they included the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,&lt;ref name="untorture"/&gt; and the Australian Senate.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt; In 2015 they included the Council of Europe, the United Nations [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw coercive medical interventions.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015" /&gt; In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right ''not'' to undergo sex affirmation interventions.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;

For [[Intersex Awareness Day]], October 26, UN experts including the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee against Torture]], the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], along with the Council of Europe [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]]s called for an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex persons, including in medical settings.

{{quotation|In countries around the world, intersex infants, children and adolescents are subjected to medically unnecessary surgeries, hormonal treatments and other procedures in an attempt to forcibly change their appearance to be in line with societal expectations about female and male bodies. When, as is frequently the case, these procedures are performed without the full, free and informed consent of the person concerned, they amount to violations of fundamental human rights...

States must, as a matter of urgency, prohibit medically unnecessary surgery and procedures on intersex children. They must uphold the autonomy of intersex adults and children and their rights to health, to physical and mental integrity, to live free from violence and harmful practices and to be free from torture and ill-treatment. Intersex children and their parents should be provided with support and counselling, including from peers.&lt;ref name="un-2016" /&gt;}}

===Constitutional Court of Colombia===
{{main|Intersex rights in Colombia}}
Although not many cases of children with intersex conditions are available, a case taken to the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] led to changes in their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Skyler|title=Reproductive Organs and Differences of Sex Development: The Constitutional Issues Created by the Surgical Treatment of Intersex Children|journal=McGeorge Law Review|year=2010–2011|volume=42|page=863|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mcglr42&amp;div=66&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case restricted the power of doctors and parents to decide surgical procedures on children's ambiguous genitalia after the age of five, while continuing to permit interventions on younger children. Due to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Colombia on Case 1 Part 1 (SU-337 of 1999), doctors are obliged to inform parents on all the aspects of the intersex child. Parents can only consent to surgery if they have received accurate information, and cannot give consent after the child reaches the age of five. By then the child will have, supposedly, realized their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corte Constitucional de Colombia: Sentencia T-1025/02|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2002/t-1025-02.htm|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case led to the setting of legal guidelines for doctors' surgical practice on intersex children.

(2) In exceptional circumstances treatment may be effected once agreement is reached between the Interdisciplinary Team and the persons exercising parental authority or tutor of the minor who is still unable to provide consent: Provided that medical intervention which is driven by social factors without the consent of the minor, will be in violation of this Act.&lt;ref name="gigesc"&gt;{{Citation| last = Malta| title = Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act: Final version| date = April 2015| url = http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=26805&amp;l=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Right to life==
{{further|Genetic diagnosis of intersex}}
[[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD or PIGD) refers to [[Genetics|genetic]] testing of [[embryo]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] (as a form of [[embryo profiling]]), and sometimes even of [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to [[prenatal diagnosis]]. When used to screen for a specific genetic condition, the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the condition under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to [[assisted reproductive technology]], and requires [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to obtain [[oocytes]] or [[embryo]]s for evaluation. The technology allows discrimination against those with [[intersex]] traits.

[[Georgiann Davis]] argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits led full and happy lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828119| issn = 1526-5161| volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = 51–53| last = Davis| first = Georgiann| author-link=Georgiann Davis|title = The Social Costs of Preempting Intersex Traits| journal = The American Journal of Bioethics| date = October 2013| pmid=24024811}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morgan Carpenter]] highlights the appearance of several intersex variations in a list by the UK [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] of "serious" "genetic conditions" that may be de-selected, including [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]] and [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], traits evident in elite women athletes and "the world's first openly [[Tony Briffa|intersex mayor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| author-link=Morgan Carpenter |title = Morgan Carpenter at LGBTI Human Rights in the Commonwealth conference| location = Glasgow| date = July 18, 2014| url = http://oii.org.au/27467/lgbti-human-rights-in-the-commonwealth/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] has called for the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] to prohibit such interventions, noting a "close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report| publisher = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last1 = Carpenter| first1 = Morgan| last2 = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]| title = Submission on the Review of Part B of the Ethical Guidelines for the Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology in Clinical Practice and Research, 2007| location = Sydney| date = April 30, 2014| url = http://oii.org.au/25621/submission-ethics-genetic-selection-intersex-traits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking:

{{quotation|Intersex people's right to life can be violated in discriminatory “sex selection” and “preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics”.

{{further|Intersex rights in Germany}}
In 2015, Michaela Raab sued doctors in Nuremberg, Germany who failed to properly advise her. Doctors stated that they "were only acting according to the norms of the time - which sought to protect patients against the psychosocial effects of learning the full truth about their chromosomes."&lt;ref name="local"&gt;{{Cite web| last = [[The Local]]| title = Intersex person sues clinic for unnecessary op| date = February 27, 2015| accessdate = 2015-12-21| url = http://www.thelocal.de/20150227/intersex-person-sues-doctors-for-unwanted-op}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 December 2015, the Nuremberg State Court ruled that the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] Clinic must pay damages and compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Zwischengeschlecht| title = Nuremberg Hermaphrodite Lawsuit: Michaela "Micha" Raab Wins Damages and Compensation for Intersex Genital Mutilations!| accessdate = 2015-12-21| date = December 17, 2015 | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Nuremberg-Hermaphrodite-Lawsuit-Damages-and-Compensation-for-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to information ==
[[File:Licence to Lie.jpg|thumb|"They should never be told ... "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Testicular Feminization.

With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, many intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed the birth of intersex babies as a "social emergency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coran|first1=Arnold G.|last2=Polley|first2=Theodore Z.|title=Surgical management of ambiguous genitalia in the infant and child|journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery|date=July 1991|volume=26|issue=7|pages=812–820|doi=10.1016/0022-3468(91)90146-K|pmid=1895191|citeseerx=10.1.1.628.4867}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure “normal” physical and psychosocial development.&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Holmes| first = Morgan| authorlink=Morgan Holmes |title = Is Growing up in Silence Better Than Growing up Different?| work = Intersex Society of North America| url = http://www.isna.org/node/743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = [[Intersex Society of North America]]| title = What's wrong with the way intersex has traditionally been treated?| url = http://www.isna.org/faq/concealment#fn2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosure also included telling people that they would never meet anyone else with the same condition.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt; Access to medical records has also historically been challenging.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; Yet the ability to provide free, informed consent depends on the availability of information.

The [[Council of Europe]]&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; and [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref name="who2015"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = World Health Organization| isbn = 9789241564984| last = [[World Health Organization]]| title = Sexual health, human rights and the law| location = Geneva| date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledge the necessity for improvements in information provision, including access to [[medical record]]s.

Some intersex organizations claim that secrecy-based models have been perpetuated by a shift in clinical language to [[Disorders of sex development]]. [[Morgan Carpenter]] of [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] quotes the work of [[Miranda Fricker]] on "hermeneutical injustice" where, despite new legal protections from discrimination on grounds of intersex status, "someone with lived experience is unable to even make sense of their own social experiences" due to the deployment of clinical language and "no words to name the experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| title = Intersex and ageing| date = February 3, 2015 | url = https://oii.org.au/28385/intersex-and-ageing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal recognition ==
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people}}
According to the [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions, few countries have provided for the legal recognition of intersex people. The Forum states that the legal recognition of intersex people is:

* firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; 
* secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and 
* thirdly, while opt in schemes may help some individuals, legal recognition is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population, but instead is about enabling an opt-in scheme for any individual who seeks it.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

In some jurisdictions, access to any form of identification document can be an issue.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

===Gender identities===
Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a particular sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl. Differentiation and dimorphism of gender identity from conception to maturity |year=1972|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-8018-1405-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Domurat Dreger |first=Alice |title=Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex |year=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-674-00189-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maranon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marañón |first=Gregorio |title=Los estados intersexuales en la especie humana |year=1929 |publisher=Morata |location=Madrid }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like non-intersex people, some intersex individuals may not identify themselves as either exclusively female or exclusively male. A 2012 clinical review suggests that between 8.5-20% of persons with intersex conditions may experience [[gender dysphoria]],&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P. S.| year = 2012 | title = Gender dysphoria associated with disorders of sex development | url = | journal = Nat. Rev. Urol. | volume = 9 | issue = 11| pages = 620–627 | doi = 10.1038/nrurol.2012.182 |display-authors=etal | pmid=23045263}}&lt;/ref&gt; while sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men and 6% unsure.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oiiaudemo"&gt;{{Citation| last = Organisation Intersex International Australia| title = Demographics| date = July 28, 2016| url = https://oii.org.au/demographics/ | accessdate = 2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to identification documents===
Depending on the jurisdiction, access to any birth certificate may be an issue,&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|journal=Reuters|date=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a birth certificate with a sex marker.&lt;ref name="adv-de"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/11/06/op-ed-germany's-third-gender-law-fails-equality | first = Hida | last = Viloria | work = The Advocate | title = Op-ed: Germany's Third-Gender Law Fails on Equality | date = November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, in the case of ''Baby 'A' (Suing through her Mother E.A) &amp; another v Attorney General &amp; 6 others [2014]'', a Kenyan court ordered the Kenyan government to issue a birth certificate to a five-year-old child born in 2009 with ambiguous genitalia.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"&gt;{{cite news| last = Migiro| first = Katy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]] a birth certificate is necessary for attending school, getting a national identity document, and voting.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"/&gt; Many intersex persons in [[Intersex rights in Uganda|Uganda]] are understood to be stateless due to historical difficulties in obtaining identification documents, despite a birth registration law that permits intersex minors to change assignment.&lt;ref name="sipd2016"&gt;{{Cite| last = Support Initiative for Persons with Congenital Disorders| title = Baseline Survey on Intersex Realities in East Africa - Specific Focus on Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to the same rights as other men and women===
The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of [[National Human Rights Institutions]] states that:
{{quotation|Recognition before the law means having legal personhood and the legal protections that flow from that. For intersex people, this is neither primarily nor solely about amending birth registrations or other official documents. Firstly, it is about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Binary categories===
Access to a birth certificate with a correct sex marker may be an issue for people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth,&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; or it may only be available accompanied by surgical requirements.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

===Third categories===
The passports and identification documents of [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] and some other nationalities have adopted "X" as a valid third category besides "M" (male) and "F" (female), at least since 2003.&lt;ref name="Science as Culture"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ingrid | last = Holme | title = Hearing People's Own Stories | journal = Science as Culture | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1080/09505430802280784 | date = 2008| pages=341–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzpass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passports.govt.nz/Transgender-applicants|title=New Zealand Passports - Information about Changing Sex / Gender Identity|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Germany became the first European nation to allow babies with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as ''indeterminate gender'' on birth certificates, amidst opposition and skepticism from intersex organisations who point out that the law appears to mandate exclusion from male or female categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dw.de/third-sex-option-on-birth-certificates/a-17193869 | title = Third sex option on birth certificates | work = [[Deutsche Welle]] | date = 1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/bluff-package-for-inter-leaving-sex-entry-open-is-not-an-option/ | title = Sham package for Intersex: Leaving sex entry open is not an option | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rt.com/news/germany-allows-third-gender-062/ | title = 'X' gender: Germans no longer have to classify their kids as male or female | work = [[RT (TV network)|RT]] | date = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe acknowledged this approach, and concerns about recognition of third and blank classifications in a 2015 Issue Paper, stating that these may lead to "forced outings" and "lead to an increase in pressure on parents of intersex children to decide in favour of one sex."&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; The Issue Paper argues that "further reflection on non-binary legal identification is necessary":

{{quotation|[[Mauro Cabral]], [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] (GATE) Co-Director, indicated that any recognition outside the “F”/”M” dichotomy needs to be adequately planned and executed with a human rights point of view, noting that: “People tend to identify a third sex with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker”&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;}}

''“Monumentalized Early Iron Age Landscapes in the Danube river basin”'' 

'''Iron-Age-Danube''' is a cross-border project and is part of the [[Interreg|Interreg Danube Transnational Programme]] of the [[European Union]]. 

In the Iron-Age-Danube project the early [[Iron Age]] landscapes in the [[Danube]] river basin are explored with the help of modern technology and traditional archaeological tools. The participating partners from [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] work together to promote the concept of archaeological [[landscape]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s beyond single [[Archaeological site|archaeological sites]] in these countries.

The project is funded by the [[European Union]] with about 2.169.200 EUR from the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF). These ERDF resources make 85% of the total project volume which is about 2.552.000 EUR.

The Iron-Age-Danube project lasts from the 1st of January 2017 till the 30th of June 2019.

== Goals of the project ==
The major goal of the project is to communicate a lively image of archaeological research and the Iron Age landscapes to the visitors and to raise the awareness for the importance of archaeological [[Ancient monument|monuments]] for the [[Human History|human history]]. 

The project Iron-Age-Danube ignores [[Border (disambiguation)|border]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;lines between the countries and researches the remains of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] (Iron Age) in the Danube region. The data of this research will help to understand the way of living in the past and the needs of the heritage today.

Another goal is the protection of the monuments and landscapes as well as their sustainable use for the tourism. To strengthen the local tourism, already existing archaeological parks or trails will be revitalised. New visitor programs in form of digital and analogous tools will be developed and implemented in 9 micro-regions. The micro-regions are: [[Großklein]] and Strettweg (Austria), [[Jalžabet]] and [[Kaptol, Požega-Slavonia County|Kaptol]] (Croatia), Poštela and [[Dolenjske Toplice]] (Slovenia) and [[Százhalombatta]], [[Süttő]] and [[Sopron]] (Hungary).

'''John Allen Paulos''' (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of [[mathematics]] at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He has gained fame as a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of [[numeracy|mathematical literacy]]. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical [[innumeracy]]; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability, and logic.

==Early life==
Paulos was born in [[Denver Colorado]] and grew up in Chicago, [[Illinois]] and [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. In an interview he described himself as lifelong skeptic.&lt;ref name=Podcast&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Skeptics!|url=http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|publisher=Christopher Brown|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062748/http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to high school in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. After his Bachelor of Mathematics at [[University of Wisconsin]] (1967) and his  Master of Science at [[University of Washington]] (1968) he received his [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1974). He was also part of the [[Peace Corps]] in the seventies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NNDB|url=http://www.nndb.com/org/786/000041663/|publisher=NNDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic work is mainly in [[mathematical logic]] and [[probability theory]].

His book ''[[Innumeracy (book)|Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences]]'' (1988) was a bestseller and ''A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper'' (1995) extended the critique. In his books Paulos discusses [[innumeracy]] with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more [[quantitative property|quantitative]] way.

He has also written on other subjects often "combining disparate disciplines", such as the mathematical and philosophical basis of humor in ''Mathematics and Humor'' and ''I Think, Therefore I Laugh'', the [[stock market]] in ''A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market'', quantitative aspects of narrative in ''Once Upon a Number'', the arguments for God in ''Irreligion'', and most recently "bringing mathematics to bear on...biography" in ''A Numerate Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Paulos |first=John Allen |interviewer=Jim Stein |title=A Numerate Life: A Mathematician Explores the Vagaries of Life, His Own and Probably Yours |url=http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |date=10 November 2015 |work=New Books in Mathematics |access-date=24 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115193717/http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |archivedate=January 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos also wrote a mathematics-tinged column for the UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' and is a [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] fellow (formally known as Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]])).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|url=http://www.csicop.org|publisher=CSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos has appeared frequently on radio and television, including a four-part [[BBC]] adaptation of ''A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper'' and appearances on the [[Lehrer News Hour]], [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]], [[Larry King]], and [[David Letterman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paulos at David Letterman |url=https://math.temple.edu/~paulos/other.html |publisher=Temple University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411001818/http://www.math.temple.edu/~paulos/other.html |archivedate=April 11, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Paulos taught a course on quantitative literacy for journalists at the Columbia University School of Journalism. The course stimulated further programs at Columbia and elsewhere in precision and data-driven journalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

His long-running "[[ABCNews.com]]" monthly column ''Who's Counting''&lt;ref name="Who's Counting"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WhosCounting/ Who's Counting] at ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; deals with mathematical aspects of stories in the news. All the columns over a 10- year period are archived here.&lt;ref name="Who's Counting"/&gt;

He is married and the father of two.

'''Juana María Rodríguez''' is a professor of Ethnic Studies, Gender and Women's Studies, and Performance Studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Her scholarly writing in [[queer theory]], [[critical race theory]], and [[performance studies]] highlights the intersection of race, gender, sexuality and embodiment in constructing subjectivity.

== Biography ==
Born Juana María de la Caridad Rodríguez y Hernández in [[Placetas|Placetas, Cuba]], Rodríguez emigrated to the United States in 1963 with her family.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces''. New York: NYU Press, 2003, p. 126.
&lt;/ref&gt; She has two siblings: and her sister [[Dinorah de Jesús Rodriguez|Dinorah de Jesús Rodríguez]],an experimental filmmaker and visual artist who works between Havana and Miami, and her brother René. Rodríguez identifies as queer and bisexual, and has published work about what she terms "bisexual erasure."&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Juana María. "Queer Politics, Bisexual Erasure: Sexuality at the Nexus of Race, Gender, and Statistics." ''Lambda Nordica'' 1-2 (2016): 169–182. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and career ===
Describing herself as an "accidental academic" in reference to her working class upbringing, Rodríguez attended [[City College of San Francisco]] before graduating with a Bachelor's degree from [[San Francisco State University]] in Liberal Studies. Her graduate degrees include a Masters in English and Comparative Literature from [[Columbia University]], and a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she studied with [[Norma Alarcón]], [[Judith Butler]], VèVè A. Clark, and [[Gerald Vizenor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crg.berkeley.edu/content/faculty-profile-associate-professor-juana-mar%C3%AD-rodr%C3%ADguez-gender-womens-studies|title=FACULTY SPOTLIGHT: Associate Professor Juana María Rodríguez, Gender &amp; Women's Studies|last=CRG Editor|first=|date=Fall 2009|website=Faultlines|publisher=Center for Race and Gender|access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining the faculty at Berkeley, Rodríguez was an Assistant Professor of English at [[Bryn Mawr College]], and an Associate Professor of Women and Gender Studies at the [[University of California, Davis]] where she served as Director of the Cultural Studies Graduate Group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heymiyuki.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/beyond-the-ivory-tower-interviews-with-academics-1-with-juana-maria-rodriguez/|title=Beyond the Ivory Tower: Interviews with Academics #1 with Juana María Rodríguez|last=Baker|first=Miyuki|date=November 30, 2015|website=|publisher=Word Press|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Berkeley, she is affiliated with the Center for Race and Gender, the Center for New Media, the Center for the Study of Sexual Culture and the [[Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society|Haas Institute for a Fair and Equitable Society]], where she was a founding member of the LGBTQ Citizen Cluster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, she was appointed to the [[University of California]] President's Advisory Committee on LGBT Students, Staff, and Faculty Member by [[Janet Napolitano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/lgbt-advisory-group-advances-recommendations-make-campuses-more-inclusive|title=LGBT advisory group advances recommendations to make campuses more inclusive|last=|first=|date=September 29, 2014|website=University of California|publisher=|access-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic contributions ==
The author of two books, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) and ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU 2014), Rodríguez has also published essays in ''[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|GLQ: a Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]]; Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory; [[Radical History Review]]; PMLA; [[MELUS]]; Profession'' and others''.'' Rodríguez's work is considered part of queer of color critique, an intervention into [[queer theory]] that argues that sexuality can not be understood or analyzed outside of the ways it is mutually constituted by race and other dimensions of difference.

=== ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ===
Rodríguez's first book, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) introduced the idea of queer ''[[latinidad]]'' as a way to disarticulate the ways that history, geography, colonialism, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, legal status, immigration status, class, color, and the politics of location exist to complicate facile notions of Latino identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In that book, Rodríguez identifies three case studies that involve different understandings of ethnic and sexual identity: activism through the queer Latino/a HIV prevention agency [[Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida]]; law through the [[Asylum in the United States|asylum]] case of Marcelo Tenorio, a gay Brazilian who was granted political asylum in the United States based on sexual persecution; and cyberspace by examining the internet chatrooms of the [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] (Internet Relay Chat) an early form of digital connectivity.

==== Queering Spanish language ====
In her chapter on the IRC, "'Welcome to the Global Stage': Confessions of a Latina Cyber-Slut" in ''Queer Latinidad'', Rodríguez documents the use of the "@" or arroba in words like Latin@, amig@s, or nostr@s seen in the Spanish language digital spaces she studied, as a "creative linguistic intervention in the highly gendered structure of Spanish." She writes, "Unlike the slash in words such as Latinos/as or amigas/os, which maintains a gender binary while attempting to be inclusive, the @ or "at sign," literally marks where an individual is at in terms of gender."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has also discussed the use of the "x" in terms such as Latinx and other approaches to the ungendering or queering of Spanish, although she also argues that gender can also be a site of pleasure and affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Sarah Hayley, and Oscar NÑ. "Latinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language." ''Latino USA''. N.p., 29 Jan. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' ===
Rodriguez's second book ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU Press 2014) looks at queer kinship practices, [[sodomy law]]s in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Latin dance]] styles, [[Television advertisement|commercials]], [[pornography]], [[burlesque]], [[San Francisco Pride|queer pride]] marches, alongside sexual practices such as [[BDSM]], [[polyamory]], daddy-play, and [[Butch and femme|butch-femme]] role playing to examine the relationship between sexual politics and sexual practices. In the book and elsewhere, she highlights how the [[Respectability politics|politics of respectability]] that surround sexuality inhibit the potential for more radical interventions into public policy and law around sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Sara. "Faculty Profile: Juana María Rodríguez on Sexuality in Public Discourse | Haas Institute." ''Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society''. N.p., 21 Mar. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, she uses the idea of [[gesture]] to emphasize non-verbal ways of communicating gendered and ethnic identity, and as a metaphor to think about activist practices that are partial, in-process and incomplete. The book features queer performance artist [[Xandra Ibarra]], and explores the taboo subject of racialized sexual violence.

==== Sexual practices ====
Rodríguez's work is often specifically praised for the ways in which it deals explicitly with queer sexual practices and forms of gender expression such as butch and femme.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dorrance, Jess. "Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings." ''Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory'' 0.0 (2016): 1–3. ''Taylor and Francis+NEJM''. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016"&gt;Dominguez, Pier. "The Potentiality of the Latina Femme Gesture." ''GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies'' 22.1 (2016): 143–145. ''glq.dukejournals.org''. Web. 10 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Tim. "No Sex Please, We're American." ''American Literary History'' (2015): ajv030. ''alh.oxfordjournals.org''. Web. 17 June 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; She frequently uses her own sexual experiences, or what she terms "sexual archives" to illuminate her ideas on racialized abjection, feminine subjection, sexual vulnerability, and femme identity. In her writing, she often references the sensory, particularly touch, as a way to articulate an embodied sexual practice and a writing practice rooted in sociality.&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dahl, Ulrika. "The Latina Femme Promise of Vulnerability and Access." ''Lambda Nordica'' 1-2 (2016): 191–196.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrido, Anahi Russo. "Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings by Juana María Rodríguez." ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' 42.1 (2016): 296–297. ''journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)''. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; In reviews of her work, reviewers frequently remark on her lyrical use of language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Other accomplishments ==

=== Awards ===
In 2015, her book, ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' won the Alan Bray Memorial Book Prize, by the GL/Q Caucus of the [[Modern Language Association]] and was a [[27th Lambda Literary Awards|Lambda Literary Foundation Finalist for LGBT Studies]].

At the University of California, Berkeley, she has won the Social Science Division, Distinguished Teaching Award and the Graduate Assembly's Faculty Mentor Award.

=== Professional affiliations ===
A member of the [[American Studies Association]], the [[Modern Language Association]], and the [[National Women's Studies Association]], she was chair of the [[Modern Language Association]]'s Committee on the Status of Literatures of People of Color in the United States and edited a collection of essays entitled the "Affirmative Activism Project"&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Juana María. "The Affirmative Activism Project." ''Profession'' (2007): 156–167. 
&lt;/ref&gt; on diversity in higher education. She was also elected to the National Council of the [[American Studies Association]] for a three-year term in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''linguistic turn''' was a major development in [[Western philosophy]] during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of [[philosophy]] and the other [[humanities]] primarily on the relationship between philosophy and [[language]].

Very different intellectual movements were associated with the "linguistic turn", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1967 anthology ''The Linguistic Turn'', in which it means the turn towards [[linguistic philosophy]]. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase "the linguistic turn" originated with philosopher [[Gustav Bergmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty]], "Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the Reification of Language" in Richard Rorty, ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'', Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, ''Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher'', University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
Traditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38153975|title=Origins of analytical philosophy|last=Dummett|first=Michael A.|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674644735|location=Cambridge. Mass.|pages=5|oclc=38153975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]], and the cleavage between [[Linguistic philosophy|ideal language philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].

===Frege===
According to [[Michael Dummett]], the linguistic turn can be dated to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1884 work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/#SH1b|title=Language, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Dummett, "Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to answer a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] question about [[Number|numbers]], "How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?" Frege invokes his "[[context principle]]", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining "the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs." Thus an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem, traditionally solved along [[Idealism|idealist]] lines, is instead solved along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Russell and Wittgenstein===
This concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to "facts" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] in "[[On Denoting]]", and played a weighty role in his early work in [[logical atomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf The Philosophy of Physical Atomism], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on [[Language game (philosophy)|language games]] in his later work. His later work (specifically ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'') significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Although Wittgenstein never used the term Linguistic turn. See  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Beyond%20the%20linguistic%20turn%20.pdf Analytic Philosophy: Beyond the Linguistic Turn and Back Again] (St. Johns College website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quine and Kripke===
[[W. V. O. Quine]] describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'']]: "[[Intension|Meaning]] is what [[essence]] becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word."&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, philosophers like [[Saul Kripke]] in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
Decisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to [[poststructuralism]] with the input of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David Kreps, ''Bergson, Complexity and Creative Emergence'', Springer, 2015, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential poststructuralist theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]].

These various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts.  According to this view, there is something like 'the ''real'' chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, ''chair'', to which the linguistic word "chair" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no ''real'' chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair ''as'' a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is ''not'' everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as ''reality'' is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called ''language''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11826">In [[art history]], an '''[[Notname|anonymous master]]''' is an [[Old Master]] whose work is known, but whose name is lost.

==Renaissance==
Only in the Renaissance did individual artists in Western Europe acquire personalities known by their peers (some listed by [[Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''), such as those known by :
* Their true name or their father's name  :
** [[Filippino Lippi]] after his father [[Fra Filippo Lippi]]
* A chosen [[pseudonym]], possibly linked to his birthplace or his father's trade :
** [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] worked on the gate of saint Gall
** [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], after his father, a chicken farmer (pollo in Italian)
** [[Jacopo del Sellaio]], after his father, a saddler (''sellier'')
** The [[Della Robbia]]s (after the Tuscan word ''robbia'', dyers' [[Rubia tinctorum|madder]], and his father, the dyer [[Luca della Robbia]])
** [[Masuccio Segondo]], student of [[Masuccio Primo]]
** etc.
* '''A surname attributed to him :'''
** [[Simone del Pollaiolo|Il Cronaca]], who never stopped talking about the ruins he had seen in Rome
** [[Daniele da Volterra]], nicknamed  ''Il Braghettone'' (the [[breeches]] maker) for having censored nudes in paintings by adding cloths or branches, at the request of [[pope Paul IV]]
** [[Luca della Robbia]], for the madder colour he used as a ceramicist
** [[Masaccio]], known as the idiot
** etc.
* '''A [[corporation]], whose generic name is given to works made by all its members :'''
** the [[Campionesi Masters]], sculptors and builders of religious buildings (Ugo da Campione, [[Bonino da Campione]], Giovanni da Campione, Zenone de Campione, Matteo da Campione)

==20th-century problems of attribution==
The idea of a named and recognised painter originated among art historians early in the 20th century, who were attributing works they recognised to known painters. They later went back on some of these attributions, renaming as anonymous the painters they had formerly named. One example is the case of [[Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], to whom [[Bernard Berenson]] attributed a number of works which were later re-attributed to [[Pseudo Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], a Florence copyist. Some painters have even been described as anonymous (even many times like [[Barthélemy Eyck]]) before later being recognised. They thus held several names historically (those who are noted on the page devoted to them), although doubts continue surrounding some, such as [[Giovanni Gaddi (painter)|Giovanni Gaddi]] (after 1333 – 1383) maybe the ''Master of the Misericordia dell’Accademia''.

==Artists whose names have since been established==
In recent years the names of a variety of artists who were formerly listed as "anonymous" have become known; accordingly scholarly writings and museum labels have been changed to reflect their new identities. Much the most famous of these is the Master of Flémalle (c 1378–1445), painter of the [[comté de Hainaut]], who was established as [[Robert Campin]]. Other examples include:
* [[Jehan Bellegambe]], sometimes called the "master of colours".
* Master of 1419 – recognised as [[Battista di Biagio Sanguigni]], having painted and dated in 1419 the central panel for a triptych executed for Santa Maria a Latera, broken up and dispersed
* Master of the Chiostro degli Aranci – recognised as being [[Giovanni Consalvo]], fresco painter at the monastery at [[Badia Fiorentina]]
* [[Barthélemy d'Eyck]] is the generally accepted as the painter known as the Master of the Aix Annunciation for paintings, and the Master of René of Anjou for illuminated manuscripts; he is also thought by many to be the Master of the Shadows
* The Dombild Master, as [[Stefan Lochner]]

The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Postman|first=Neil|date=|website=Media Ecology Association|publisher=|access-date=2 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Media ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and [[communication technology]] is the primary cause of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hakanen|first=Ernest A.|title=Branding the teleself: Media effects discourse and the changing self|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]", which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period.

Additionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of "traffic" between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=eea7d6ba-45f9-4434-912c-3d9a2405e153@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Infrastructuralism: Media as Traffic between Nature and Culture.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

===Marshall McLuhan===

In 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at [[Cambridge University]], a school which pioneered modern literary [[criticism]]. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, [[I.A. Richards]], a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan's later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards' approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication.&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchand|first=Philip|title=Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and The Messenger : A Biography|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-63186-5|pages=37–39|edition=Rev Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards believed that "words won't stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This element of Richards' perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as "[[Global village (term)|The Global Village]]" and "[[The Medium Is the Message]]" two of his most well known phrases that encapsulate the theory of Media Ecology.  
[[File:Marshall McLuhan.jpg|thumb|[[Marshall McLuhan]], c. 1936.]]
McLuhan used the approaches of Richards, [[William Empson]], and [[Harold Innis|Harlold Innis]] as an "entrée to the study of media".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that "if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their 'content' but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This led to the emergence of his ideas on Media Ecology.

In addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/|title=Who was Marshall McLuhan? – The Estate of Marshall McLuhan|website=marshallmcluhan.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie ''[[Annie Hall]]''.

Few theories receive the kind of household recognition that Media Ecology received, due directly to McLuhan's role as a pop culture icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Megan|year=2006|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw : Marshall McLuhan's 'Understanding Media'|jstor=40061070|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=373–380|doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an excellent debater and public speaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marshall McLuhan: The medium and the messenger|last=Marchand|first=Phillip|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|year=1989|isbn=0899194850|location=New York|pages=153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia.

=== Neil Postman ===
Inspired by McLuhan, [[Neil Postman]] founded the Program in Media Ecology at [[New York University]] in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "What is Media Ecology." ''Media Ecology Association.'' 2009. Web. 29 Sept 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments - like language itself, symbolic environments with in which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "Teaching as a conserving activity." Instructor 89.4 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Postman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. "I don't see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context."&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Em. A First Look at Communication Theory. 7th ed. New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill , 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  Postman's media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain?&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

=== North American, European and Eurasian versions ===
Media ecology is a contested term within [[media studies]] for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/index.html|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Nystrom|first=Christine|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strate|first=Lance|year=2004|title=A Media Ecology Review|url=http://cscc.scu.edu/trends/v23/v23_2.pdf|journal=Communication Research Trends|volume=23|pages=28–31|issn=0144-4646|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by [[Yuri Rozhdestvensky]]. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polski, M. |author2=Gorman, L.|year=2012|title=Yuri Rozhdestvensky vs. MArshall McLuhan: A triumph vs. a Vortex|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=10 |issue=3–4|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=13566/|doi=10.1386/eme.10.3-4.263_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Polski, M.|year=2013|title=Media Ecology Pedagogy—Art or Techne?|conference=MEA conference|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used "because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuller, Matthew|title=Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|pp=2–3|isbn=9780262062473|series=Leonardo Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following theorists such as [[Felix Guattari]], [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Manuel De Landa]], the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] and [[Jussi Parikka]]) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems.

=== Other contributions ===
Along with McLuhan {{Harv|McLuhan|1962}}, Postman {{Harv|Postman|1985}} and [[Harold Innis]], media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of [[Walter Ong]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Eric Havelock]], [[Susanne Langer]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Edward T. Hall]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], and [[Gregory Bateson]].

==Core concepts==

=== Assumptions of the theory ===
* Media are infused in every act and action in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = West|first = Richard|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year = 2010|publisher = Mc Graw Hill|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-07-338507-5|pages = 428–430|edition = 4|author2 = Lynn H. Turner|chapter = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Media fix our perceptions and organize our experiences.
* Media tie the world together.

These three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community.

===McLuhan's media history===

McLuhan believed there are three inventions that transformed the world: the [[phonemic orthography|phonetic alphabet]], the [[printing press]], and the [[telegraph]]. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan split history into four periods:&lt;ref name="epoch" /&gt; the tribal age, the literary age, the print age, and the [[electronic age]] (information age). Throughout the structure of their distinctive methods of communication (e.g., oral, written, printed, electronic), different media arouse patterns in the brain that are distinctive to each and every particular form of communication.&lt;ref name="epoch"&gt;{{cite book|last = McLuhan|first = M.|title = The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects|year = 1967|publisher = HardWired|location = San Francisco|isbn = 978-1-888869-02-6|pages = |author2 = Fiore Q.|author3 = Agel J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribal age====

The first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age, a time of community because the ear is the dominant sense organ. This is also known as an acoustic era because the senses of hearing, touch, taste, and smell were far more strongly developed than the ability to visualize. During this time, hearing was more valuable because it allowed people to be more immediately aware of their surroundings, which was extremely important for hunting. Everyone hears at the same time making listening to someone in a group a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this world of surround sound, everything is more immediate, more present, and fosters more passion and spontaneity. During the Tribal Age, hearing was believing.

====Literacy age====

The second age is the Literacy Stage, a time of private detachment because the eye is the dominant sense organ; also known as the visual era. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to read over and over again. Hearing no longer becomes trustworthy; seeing was believing. Even though people read the same words, the act of reading is an individual act of singular focus. Tribes didn't need to come together to get information anymore. This is when the invention of the alphabet came about. During this time, when people learned to read, they became independent thinkers.

====Print age====

The third stage is the Print Age, when individual products were mass produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book. It allowed people to carry books, so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from immediacy of their surroundings.

====Electronic age====

Lastly, the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the [[Information Age|information age]], is an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returned us to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. Being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone's business and everyone's business is everyone else's. This phenomenon is called the [[Global village (term)|global village]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Updating the ages ====
[[Robert K. Logan]] is professor emeritus of [[physics]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the [[Ontario College of Art and Design]]. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras:
# Age of nonverbal mimetic communication (characteristic of archaic [[Homo sapiens]])
# Age of orality
# Age of literacy
# Age of electric mass media
# Age of digital interactive media, or 'new media'&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding New Media: Extending Marshall McLuhan|last=Logan|first=Robert K.|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781433111266|location=New York|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a "[[participatory culture]]." Tom Valcanis argues that this very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple's iPhone. "If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and 'mash-up' culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a 'participatory culture'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2a4280c5-20e6-4610-831e-e8e7e7c9ae04@sessionmgr4007|title=AN IPHONE IN EVERY HAND: MEDIA ECOLOGY, COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES, AND THE G...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='The medium is the message'===

"The medium is the message"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding media|last = McLuhan|first = Marshall|publisher = Mentor|year = 1964|isbn = 978-0262631594|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society.

For example, [[traditional media]] is an extension of the human body, while the [[new media]] is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society.  The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That's why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianhong|author2=Guilan Ding|title=SPECIAL COMMENTARY New media as relations|journal=Chinese Journal of Communication|date=November 2009|volume= 2| issue =  3|pages=367–369|url=http://www.informaworld.com|doi=10.1080/17544750903209242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are accustomed to thinking the [[message]] is separate from a [[Medium (website)|medium.]] McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlook the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. "It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive.&lt;ref name="Strate"&gt;Strate, Lance. "Studying Media as Media: McLuhan and the Media Ecology Approach." MediaTropes eJournal. 1. (2008): 1-16. Web. 28 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us.

Different mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed.&lt;ref name="Strate" /&gt; With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.

==== The Metaphor ====
The key elements to Media Ecology has been largely attributed to Marshal McLuhan, who coined the statement “the medium is the message.” Levinson furthers McLuhan’s statement by stating that “the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=paul|date=2000|title=McLuhan and Media Ecology|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/levinson01.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=1|pages=17-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to Media Ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

The very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scolari|first=Carlos A.|date=2012-04-09|title=Media Ecology: Exploring the Metaphor to Expand the Theory|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article-abstract/22/2/204/4085708?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204–225|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01404.x|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Carlos Scolari states, “the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase “the medium is the message”. Author Niall Stephan argues that while most attribute the  metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of “media ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Niall|date=2014|title=Toward a More Substantive Media Ecology: Postman's Metaphor Versus Posthuman Futures|url=|journal=International Journal of Communications|volume=8|pages=2027-2045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Janet Sternburg|Janet Sternberg]] has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese “yin/ yang” metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions can be distinguished in the field: the “yang” tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on [[intrapersonal communication]] and the “yin” tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v3/Sternberg03.pdf|title=The Yin and Yang of Media Ecology|last=Sternberg|first=Janet|date=2002|year=|website=MEA Convention Proceedings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Connection to general systems theory ====
While [[general systems theory]] originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as "one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://summit.is4is.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/logan3text.pdf|title=General Systems Theory and Media Ecology: Parallel Disciplines that Inform Each Other|date=June 2015|doi=10.1386/eme.14.1-2.39_1|author=Robert Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology "cross pollinate each other" in that,  "a general system is a medium" due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are "quasi-deterministic".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, "A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Global village ===
Marshall McLuhan used the phrase [[Global village (term)|global village]] to describe that "humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous [[electronic media]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing communication theory: analysis and application|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073385075|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' saying, "Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremblay|first1=Gaetan|title=From Marshall McLuhan to Harold Innis, or From the Global Village to the World Empire|journal=Canadian Journal of Communications|date=2012|volume=37|issue=4|page=572|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2662/2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology, especially electronic media in today's age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries.

This seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan's day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today's society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Walkosz, Barbara J.|author2=Tessa Jolls|author3= Mary Ann Sund|title=Global/Local: Media Literacy for the Global Village|work=Medialit.org|conference= Proc. of International Media Literacy Research Forum, London|publisher=OfCom|year=2008|url=http://www.medialit.org/sites/default/files/33_globallocal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note is McLuhan's insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one's own community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of 'Spaceship Earth' where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-66-issue-4/herarticle/redefining-the-value-of-school_287|title=The Harvard Educational Review - HEPG|website=hepg.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the original person to coin the term 'Spaceship Earth' was futurists R. Buckminster Fuller who once said, "I've often heard people say: 'I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,' and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That's all we have experienced. We're all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/spaceshipearth|title=Spaceship Earth {{!}} The Buckminster Fuller Institute|website=www.bfi.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K|first=Dixon, Violet|date=2009-01-01|title=Understanding the Implications of a Global Village|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/61/understanding-the-implications-of-a-global-village|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=1|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the global village helps to conceptualize [[globalization]] within society. Michael Plugh writes, "[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global village: Globalization through a media ecology lens|date=2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|issue=3-4|pages=219–235|doi=10.1386/eme.13.3-4.219_1|author=Plugh, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, "Where literate societies exchange an 'eye for an ear,' according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or 'global' level."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Hot vs. cool media===
McLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall, and Quentin Fiore. "The medium is the message." New York 123 (1967): 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot media]] refer to a high-definition communication that demand little involvement from the audience and concentrate on one sensory organ at a time. These types of media require no interpretation because they give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. [[Cool media]] describe media that demand active involvement from the audience. Cool media require the audience to be active and fill in information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding media: The Extension of Man|year=1994|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-63159-4|author2=Lewis H. Lapham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Innis: The Philosophical Historian. An Exchange of Ideas Between Prof. Marshall McLuhan and Prof. Eric A. Havelock," recorded at Innis College, Toronto, October 14, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of media ecology is the ''laws of media,'' which McLuhan outlined with his son [[Eric McLuhan]] to further explain the influence of technology on society.&lt;ref name="Laws of media"&gt;{{cite book|title=Laws of media: The new science|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8020-7715-8|location=Toronto|pages=98–99|author2=Eric McLuhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples' critical thinking skills and to prepare people for "the social and physical chaos" that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology.
[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|thumb|Depiction of Media Tetrad]]
The four effects, as depicted in the [[tetrad of media effects]] are:&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt;
* ''Enhancement'': What does the medium enhance? Media can enhance various social interactions, such as the telephone, which reduced the need for face-to-face interactions.
* ''Obsolescence'': What does the medium obsolesce? Technological advancements can render older media obsolete, as television did for the radio. This does not necessarily mean that the older medium is completely eradicated however, as radio, for example, is still in use today. 
* ''Retrieval'': What does the medium retrieve? New media can also spur a restoration of older forms of media, which the new forms may not be able to incorporate into their new technologies. For example, the Internet has promoted new forms of social conversations, which may have been lost through television. 
* ''Reversal'': What will the medium reverse? When a medium is overwhelmed due to its own nature, "pushed to the limit of its potential,"&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt; it ceases to have functional utility and can cause a reversion to older media.

==Criticism==

===Technological determinism===
A significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. [[Determinism]] insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language ([[linguistic determinism]]), religion ([[theological determinism]]), financial ([[economic determinism]]). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man's technological achievements they can be classified as [[technological determinism]]. According to Postman, "The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Postman has also stated that "a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture's politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Postman|first=Neil|title=The Humanism of Media Ecology|url=http://media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/humanism_of_media_ecology.html|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Michael Zimmer (academic)|Michael Zimmer]] view McLuhan and his "Medium is the Message" theory as a prime example of technological determinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by McLuhan's (1964/1994) assertion 
that "the medium is the message", the technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism of the embodied theory of technological bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zimmer, Michael|authorlink=Michael Zimmer (academic)|title=Media Ecology and Value Sensitive Design: A Combined Approach to Understanding the Biases of Media Technology|conference=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=6|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world "by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio-cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important."&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fekete, John|title=McLuhanacy: Counterrevolution in cultural theory|journal=Telos|year=1973|volume=1973|issue=15|pp=75–123|doi=10.3817/0373015075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lance Strate]], on the other hand, argues that McLuhan's theories are in no way deterministic. "McLuhan never actually used the term, "determinism," nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, ''The Medium is the Message'', he wrote, "there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening" (McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan's position with the quote, "we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Culkin, J.|year=1967|chapter=Each culture develops its own sense ratio to meet the demands of its environment|editor=G. Stearn|title=McLuhan: Hot and cool|pp=49–57|location=New York: New American Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a transactional approach to media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strate, Lance|title=Studying media as media: McLuhan and the media ecology approach|journal=MediaTropes|volume=1|issue=1|year=2008|p=133|url=http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/3344/1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as "[[soft determinism]]" opposed to "[[hard determinism]]" with the difference being that "hard determinism" indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas "soft determinism" would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome.

While ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Paul-Peter Verbeek argued that technologies are "inherently moral agents" and their development is a "moral enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cussing the buzz-saw, or, the medium is the morality of Peter-Paul Verbeek|date=2016|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1386/eme.15.2.129_1|author=Grosswiler, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Technological Artefacts Be Moral Agents?|date=2011|publisher=|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=411–424|doi=10.1007/s11948-010-9241-3|pmid=20927601|pmc=3183318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter-Paul Verbeek|title=Obstetric Ultrasound and the Technological Mediation of Morality: A Postphenomenological Analysis|date=1 March 2008|publisher=|journal=Human Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=11–26|doi=10.1007/s10746-007-9079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disruptions to existing systems ===
While advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.waccglobal.org/articles/a-shifting-media-ecology-what-the-age-of-luther-can-teach-us|title=A shifting media ecology: What the age of Luther can teach us|journal=Media Development|date=2017|volume=64|issue=2|pp=5–10|author=Soukup, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# New Technologies
# New Audiences
# New Authority
#New Rhetoric

One example where this can be seen is in do-it-yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it-yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include "any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A media ecological analysis of do-it-yourself education: Exploring relationships between the symbolic and the material realms of human action|author=John Dowd|doi=10.1386/eme.13.2.155_1|date=June 2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|number=2|pp=155–175(21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.

==== Mobility and Modality ====
Various scholars have looked to media ecology theory through different lenses to better understand this theory in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. While Sternberg applied the yin/yang metaphor to make sense of the theory, Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick et. al create a new languages of modality. As such, contributing to a new rhetoric to contextualize Media Ecology in the age of the internet, social media, and advances in technologies. Hildebrand uses the conceptualization of ‘mediated mobilities’ to illustrate a connection between media ecology and mobilities research, ultimately making a case for a ''modal medium theory''. She looks into the articles of Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, and Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states Media Ecology Theory is “grammar and rhetoric, semiotics and systems theory, the history and the philosophy of technology”.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hildebrand|first=Julia M|date=2017-05-11|title=Modal media: connecting media ecology and mobilities research|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443717707343|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=348–364|doi=10.1177/0163443717707343|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hildebrand explains that Strate’s concept of media ecology is not limited to the study of information and communication technology but technology, in general. Technology is therefore implying materialities and mobilities that is put into relation with media ecology. As Hildebrand states, “[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Much like Media Ecology, mobilities research talk about a “flow” that shapes the environment, creating a contact zones. Dimmick furthers this statement by creating a term that describes the intersection of communication environments (“contact zones”) and issues of mobility- ''interstices.''&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimmick|first=John|last2=Feaster|first2=John Christian|last3=Hoplamazian|first3=Gregory J.|date=2010-05-18|title=News in the interstices: The niches of mobile media in space and time|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444810363452|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=23–39|doi=10.1177/1461444810363452|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of “nonspace” or “nonplace” considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===The medium is not the message===
McLuhan's critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really "the medium is the message" is a metaphor not an equation.  His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an "extension of man" and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments.&lt;ref name=Grosswiler&gt;{{cite book|last=Grosswiler|first=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|location=p.52|isbn=9781433110672|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of McLuhan's high profile critics was [[Umberto Eco]]. Eco comes from background in [[semiotics]], which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan's assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual's interpretation can vary.  Believing this to be true Eco says, "It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it." In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan's assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=W. Terrance|title=McLuhan: A Guide for the Perplexed|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing|location=London, GBR|isbn=9781441143808|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===

The North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"/&gt; and Neil Compton as meaningless or "McLuhanacy". According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, "it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Raymond|title=McLuhan: Pro and Con|year=1968|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|location=New York|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Jonathan Miller]] claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan's willingness to back away from a "probe" if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|title=Marshall McLuhan|year=1971|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0670019120|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists against McLuhan's idea, such as [[Raymond Rosenthal]], also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims:&lt;ref name='Strate'/&gt; "McLuhan's books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt; Additionally, As [[Lance Strate]] said: "Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a "Great Divide" theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics.

==Research ==

===New media===
Many ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current [[new media]] has a "new" stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of [[web 2.0]]. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, [[Tim O'Reilly]]. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about 'the widespread sense that there's something qualitatively different about today's Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and 'mash ups'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=What Is Web 2.0? Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2005/09/what-is-web-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a [[participatory culture]] which proves Neil Postman's saying "[[Wikiversity:Neil Postman: Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change|technological change]] is not additive; it is ecological".

As new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which "portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation".&lt;ref name=Milberry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milberry|first=K|author2=Anderson, S.|title=Open Sourcing Our Way to an Online Commons: Contesting Corporate Impermeability in the New Media Ecology|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|year=2009|pages=393–412|volume=33|issue=4|doi=10.1177/0196859909340349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers.&lt;ref name=Milberry/&gt; So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons.

There is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and [[media literacy]] in its youth.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gumpert|first=Gary|author2=Robert Cathcart|title=Media grammars, generations, and media gaps|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Communication|year=1985|volume=2|pages=23–35|doi=10.1080/15295038509360059}}&lt;/ref&gt; As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"/&gt; The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media.

According to the media ecology theory, analyzing today's generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today's new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is "the world's first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huntley|first=Rebecca|title=The World According to Y: Inside the New Adult Generation|year=2006|publisher=Crows Nest NSW|location=Australia|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, "there may actually be no unified ethos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Serazio|first=Michael|title=(New) Media Ecology and Generation Mash-Up Identity: The Technological Bias of Millennial Youth Culture|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/8/6/6/p238668_index.html|conference= NCA 94th Annual Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With "hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Screenagers: Lessons In Chaos From Digital Kids|year=2006|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1572736245|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 2009 a study was published by Cleora D'Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled "How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D'Arcy, C. J.|author2=Eastburn, D. M.|author3=Bruce, B. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs|journal=College Teaching|volume=57|issue=1|pp=56–63|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/274764053|doi=10.3200/CTCH.57.1.56-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested "new media" such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing "hot" and "cold" media at today's standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most "valued" method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning.

==Application and Case Studies ==
There is significant research being done on the rise of [[social media]] platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their influence on communication in society. Some of that research is being done through a media ecology perspective. Below are some examples: 

=== Social media activism ===
While many people utilize social media platforms to stay in contact with friends and family, socialize, or even shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correa|first=Teresa|last2=Hinsley|first2=Amber Willard|last3=de Zúñiga|first3=Homero Gil|date=2010-03-01|title=Who interacts on the Web?: The intersection of users' personality and social media use|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; these platforms have also been pivotal for social activism. [[Social media activism]] and [[hashtag activism]] have become popular ways to gain mainstream media and public attention for causes, and to facilitate protests.

Thomas Poell researched the influence of social media on the 2010 protests of the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit|Toronto G20 Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poell|first=Thomas|year=2014|title=Social media and the transformation of activist communication: exploring the social media ecology of the 2010 Toronto G20 protests|url=|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=716–731|via=|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2013.812674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, he focused on identifying how each social media site was used independently, and then how they were integrated together. The sites analyzed were [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Flickr|Flikr]], Facebook, and an open publishing website. What he found is that each site is used differently for social media activism. While this kind of activism was originally looked at as a way to promote causes and encourage long term focus on the issues, Poell found that sites like Twitter and Facebook tend to do the opposite. Posts center around photographs and videos of action during protests and rallies, not on the issues that are being protested. This would be an example of hot media, because the user can scroll through photos or watch videos without being otherwise engaged, instead of cool media where the user has to be more involved. Additionally, because activists are using sites they do not own, the social media platform actually has more control over the information being posted. For example, Twitter no longer allows unrestricted access to all posts made with a certain hashtag after a period of time. This seems to mean that the issue being highlighted fades over time.

Additionally, Heather Crandall and Carolyn M. Cunningham focus on hashtag activism, where activists use [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tags]] to focus on specific issues (ex: #activism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crandall|first=Heather|last2=Cunningham|first2=Carolyn M.|year=2016|title=Media ecology and hashtag activism: #Kaleidoscope|url=|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=22–32|doi=10.1386/eme.15.1.21_1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not look at one specific protest like the G20 summit, but rather at the benefits and criticisms of hashtag activism as a whole. They discuss that social media is a new media ecology, one where users can connect and share ideas without boundaries. This falls under McLuhan's idea of the world as a global village. By using hashtags, activists are able to bring awareness to social issues. Crandall and Cunningham point out that this is both beautiful and interesting, because it encourages learning, conversations, and community for social justice, and that it is also dark and confusing, because the open environment of the internet also allows hashtags to be used for hate speech and threats of violence. Also, they posit that hashtag activism is pointed and stacked, in that hashtags are often short lived, and the user has to be able to navigate the platform and understand hashtags in order to gain knowledge of the issue. When viewed through media ecology, hashtag activism is changing the way people encounter and engage in social justice.

=== Case Studies ===

==== [[Arab Spring]]: Egypt and Iran ====
Doctor Mark Allen Peterson of in the Department of Anthropology at Miami University published an article in the Summer of 2011 comparing the media ecology of 1970's Iran to that in Egypt in 2011. The article, title "Egypt's Media Ecology in a Time of Revolution"&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Peterson, Mark Allen. "Egypt's media ecology in a time of revolution." Arab media &amp; society 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; looks at the difference that social media made in the Egyptian uprising and makes two observations: social media extends the "[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]" network and that social media, despite the result of the uprising, completely changes the "[[mediascape]]" of Egypt. One dramatic difference between the two uprising noticed by Peterson is the ultimate position of the media of choice during each in the end. On the one hand, Iran's news media, the primary source of information at that time, reverted to its original role, while the Egyptian use of social media changed the media of choice for Egypt.

Peterson's study compared his observations to that of William Beeman, who in 1984 published an essay, "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after"&lt;ref name=Beeman&gt;Beeman, William O. "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after." The news media and national and international conflict (1984): 147-165.&lt;/ref&gt; on the media ecology of Iran. Beeman's ultimate conclusion of his review of the [[Iranian Revolution]] followed that of what you would expect to find from most media ecologists: "At times newly introduced mass media have produced revolutionary effects in the societal management of time and energy as they forged new spaces for themselves. Thus media are cultural forces as well as cultural objects. In operation, they produce specific cultural effects that cannot be easily predicted."&lt;ref name=Beeman/&gt;{{rp|147}}

Although there were many similarities between the Iranian and [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutions]], such as censorship in media, including newspaper and television, the one major difference was the availability of the internet and social media as a tool to spread messages and increase awareness in Egypt. Social media in 2011's uprising was equivalent to the use of cassette tapes in Iran in the 1970s. The tapes provided a way to spread information that could not be as easily censored and was repeatable through the country.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}} The rise of social media helped free Egyptians from censorship of other media. In this case, the medium was the message, a message of freedom and by the Egyptian government's attempt to also censor this medium, they only managed to spread the message further and faster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although we may never know the true impact, in fact it likely sped up the regime's fall. In the absence of new technologies, people were forced to rely on traditional means of communication, including knocking on doors, going to the mosque, assembling in the street, or other central gathering places. Thomas Schelling won a Nobel prize in part for discovering that in the absence of information, people will coordinate by selecting a focal point that seems natural, special or relevant to them. Given the protests, Tahrir Square was the obvious focal point. By blocking the Internet, the government inadvertently fueled dissent and galvanized international support for the people of Egypt. (Bowman 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Warigia. 2011. Dictators and the Internet. Cairo Review of Global Affairs. http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/CairoReview/Pages/articleDetails.aspx?aid=34 [accessed November 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 2011, leaders of the protest continue to utilize social media as a method to push democratic reform.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|4}} According to Peterson the role of social media in Egypt is also evolving the political culture as even state figures are beginning to make announcements using social media rather than more traditional forms of media.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Much like the Arab Spring, the Gezi protests were an environmental sit-in that ultimately turned into a social movement based on the influence of various forms of social media. Rolien Hoyng and Murat Es coin the term “Turkish media ecology” to evoke a sense of particularly on the part of Turkey’s relationship with media outlets and platforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc|title=Conspiratorial Webs: Media Ecology and Parallel Realities in Turkey|last=Hoyng|first=Rolien|last2=Es|first2=Murat|date=2016|website=International Journal of Communications|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, media censorship and control by state institutions most directly impact broadcast media. Both authors emphasize how “…media-ecological affordances are conditioned and modulated by legal frameworks and institutional-political rationalities”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They also note that such censored media ecology forms a ‘fertile milieu’ for the proliferation of conspiracy theories which both feed on one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Scholar Gulizar Haciyakupoglu examines how social media influenced the protests, specifically looking at how trust was built and maintained among protestors across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haciyakupoglu|first=Gulizar|last2=Zhang|first2=Weiyu|date=2015-03-18|title=Social Media and Trust during the Gezi Protests in Turkey|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/4/450/4067584|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=450–466|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12121|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his interviews, the scholar extrapolates that “closed groups” like Whatsapp and Facebook “…allowed the circulation of confidential and trustworthy information among first- and second-degree friends” whereas Twitter was used for “rapid acquisition of logistic information” that became important during the protest.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 

====[[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15M Movement]]: Spain  ====
Emiliano Treré looks to the Media Ecology metaphor as a way to investigate the relationship between social movements, media ecologies and communication technologies through the lens of Spain’s 15M movement. Treré states how most scholars believe the media ecological framework is particularly suited for the study of the social movements/media nexus “…because of its ability to provide fine-tuned explorations of the multiplicity, the interconnections, the dynamic evolution of old and new media forms for social change”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treré|first=Emiliano|last2=Mattoni|first2=Alice|date=2015-11-25|title=Media ecologies and protest movements: main perspectives and key lessons|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1109699|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=290–306|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109699|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also agrees with Scolari (mentioned above) that the key reflections from the theory is especially beneficial for modern analysis on media and social events.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One such application is seen with the analysis of Spain’s anti-austerity movement, also called the “15M movement.” Facing different degrees of mainstream media manipulation and bias “various media activists turned to Web TV services, radical online tools, Twitter and Facebook among others to organize, and contrast the official narratives of the protest."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Scholar John Postill argues that Twitter, among all the types of technologies used, produced a greater effect for setting and tone and agenda of the movement.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Postill|first=John|date=2013-10-23|title=Democracy in an age of viral reality: A media epidemiography of Spain’s indignados movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1466138113502513|journal=Ethnography|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=51–69|doi=10.1177/1466138113502513|issn=1466-1381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such appropriation of technologies demonstrates the dichotomies between old and new technologies that in term created a kind of “technological sovereignty” among activists.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Media Ecology has the innate ability to aggregate different analytical approaches to better understand the technology that is at place during such a protest. Postill and other scholars ultimately look to a new age in social activism, where “viral” posts shared by media professionals and amateurs empower people and become the rising voice for the future of democracy in Spain.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The '''mental lexicon''' is defined as a mental dictionary that contains information regarding a word's meaning, pronunciation, syntactic characteristics, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackendoff|first=R.S|title=Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, and Evolution|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental lexicon is a construct used in [[linguistics]] and [[psycholinguistics]] to refer to individual speakers' lexical, or word, [[Mental representation|representations]]. However, not all scientists agree as to the utility of the mental lexicon as a scientific construct.

The mental lexicon differs from the [[lexicon]] in that it is not just a general collection of words; instead, it deals with how those words are activated, stored, processed, and retrieved by each speaker. An individual's mental lexicon changes and grows as new words are learned and is always developing, but there are several theorists that argue exactly how this occurs. Some theories about the mental lexicon include the spectrum theory, the [[dual-coding theory]], [[Chomsky]]'s [[Universal grammar|nativist theory]], as well as the semantic network theory. Scientists also study the areas of the brain involved in lexical representations. The following addresses some of the physiological, social, and linguistic aspects of the mental lexicon.

Recent studies have also shown the possibility that the mental lexicon can shrink as an individual ages, limiting the number of words they can remember and learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima,|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time.|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology|year=2010|volume=25|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a second mental lexicon (L2) in bilingual speakers has also emerged as a topic of interest, suggesting that a speaker's multiple languages are not stored together, but as separate entities that are actively chosen from in each linguistic situation.&lt;ref name=jiang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Nan|title=Lexical Representation and Development in a Second Language|journal=Applied Linguistics|year=2000|volume=21|pages=47–77|doi=10.1093/applin/21.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of inquiry==
Although the mental lexicon is often called a mental "dictionary", in actuality, research suggests that it differs greatly from a dictionary. For example, the mental lexicon is not organized alphabetically like a dictionary; rather, it seems to be organized in a more complex manner, with links between phonologically and semantically related lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Jean"&gt;{{cite book | author = Aitchison, Jean | title = Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon | location = Malden, MA | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is suggested by evidence of phenomena such as [[slips of the tongue]], which showed that replacing words such as ''anecdote'' for ''antidote''.&lt;ref name = "Jean"/&gt;

Also, while dictionaries contain a fixed number of words to be counted, and remain outdated as language is continually changing, the mental lexicon consistently updates itself with new words and word meanings, while getting rid of old, unused words. The active nature of the mental lexicon makes any dictionary comparison unhelpful.&lt;ref name = "CLA"&gt;{{cite book | title = Contemporary Linguistic Analysis (5th Custom Edition for U of A) | publisher = Pearson Custom Publishing | location = Toronto, ON | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is continuing to identify the exact way that words are linked and accessed. A common method to analyze these connections is through a [[lexical decision task|lexical decision]]  task.&lt;ref name="CLA"/&gt;

'''Lexical Decision Tasks''' have been used for many years to access how the mental lexicon is structured. Participants in this task are required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to a string of letters presented on a screen to say if the string is a non-word or a real word.&lt;ref name=altman&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=Gerry|title=The Ascent of Babel: An Exploration of Language, Mind, and Understanding|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198523777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction times from this task indicate that certain words are more "active" in participants' minds after related words have been presented. An example of this would be to present the word "bread" to the participant and then see an decreased reaction time later to the word "butter". Since the word "bread" had activated all related words, including "butter", this decreased reaction time demonstrates that related words are stored closely in the mental lexicon.&lt;ref name=altman /&gt; By doing lexical decision tasks, researchers have been able to analyze what words are stored with what related counterparts, and what can activate these words.

==Theories and perspectives==
Not all linguists and psychologists believe in the mental lexicon's existence and there is much controversy over the concept. One theory about the mental lexicon states that it organizes our knowledge about words "in some sort of dictionary."&lt;ref name="Access"&gt;{{ cite book | title = Accessing the Mental Lexicon | url = http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090807014649/http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | archivedate = 2009-08-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another states that the mental lexicon is "a collection of highly complex neural circuits".&lt;ref name = "Access"/&gt; The latter, '''Semantic Network Theory''', proposes the idea of ''spreading activation'', which is a hypothetical mental process that takes place when one of the nodes in the semantic network is activated, and proposes three ways this is done: priming effects, neighborhood effects, and frequency effects, which have all been studied in depth over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forster|first=Kenneth|author2=Chambers|title=Lexical Access and Naming Time|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date=December 1973|volume=12|issue=6|pages=627–635|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(73)80042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marslen-Wilson|first=William|title=Functional Parallelism in Spoken Word-Recognition|journal=Cognition|date=March 1987|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=71–102|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90005-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Priming''' is a term used in Lexical Decision Tasks that accounts for decreased reaction times of related words. Interchangeable with the word "activation" in many cases, priming refers to the ability to have related words assist in the reaction times of others. In the example above, the word bread "primed" butter to be retrieved quicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Traxler|first=Matthew|title=Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1405198621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Neighborhood Effects''' refer to the activation of all similar "neighbors" of a target word. Neighbors are defined as items that are highly confusable with the target word due to overlapping features of other words. An example of this would be that the word "game" has the neighbors "came, dame, fame, lame, name, same, tame, gale, gape, gate, and gave," giving it a neighborhood size of 11 because 11 new words can be constructed by only changing 1 letter of "game". The neighborhood effect claims that words with larger neighborhood sizes will have quicker reaction times in a lexical decision task suggesting that neighbors facilitate the activation of other neighborhood words.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Sally|title=Frequency and Neighborhood Effects on Lexical Access: Activation or Search?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=September 1989|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.15.5.802|pages=802–814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Frequency Effects''' suggest that words that are frequent in an individual's language are recognized faster than words that are infrequent. Forster and Chambers, 1973, found that high frequency words were named faster than low frequency ones, and Whaley, 1978 found that high frequency words were responded to faster than low frequency ones in a lexical decision task.&lt;ref name="Access"/&gt;

In the '''spectrum theory''', at one end "each phonological form is connected to one complex semantic representation", at the opposite end, homonyms and polysemes have their "own semantic representation[s]".&lt;ref name = "Brown"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brown, S. W | title = Polysemy in the Mental Lexicon. Colorado Research in Linguistics | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | year = 2008 |url=http://www.colorado.edu/ling/CRIL/Volume21_Issue1/paper_BROWN.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The middle of the spectrum contains the theories that "suggest that related senses share a general or core semantic representation".&lt;ref name = "Brown"/&gt; The "[[dual coding theory]] (DCT)"&lt;ref name = "Paivio"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paivio, A | title = Dual coding theory and the mental lexicon | journal = The Mental Lexicon | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–230 | year = 2010 | doi=10.1075/ml.5.2.04pai}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts multiple and [[common coding theory|common coding theories]]. DCT is "an internalized nonverbal system that directly represents the perceptual properties and affordances of nonverbal objects and events, and an internalized verbal system that deals directly with linguistic stimuli and responses".&lt;ref name = "Paivio"/&gt; Similarly, we do not observe words "as elements in a data structure" that are "retrieved from memory, but rather as stimuli that alter mental states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elman, J. L | title = Lexical knowledge without a lexicon? | journal = The Mental Lexicon | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–33 | year = 2011 | doi=10.1075/ml.6.1.01elm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others work around Chomsky's theory that "all syntactic and semantic features are included directly in the abstract mental representation of a lexical word".&lt;ref name = "Paivio"/&gt;

==Development==

=== First language development ===
[[File:Chart updated.jpg|thumb|Average vocabulary size of an English-speaking child by age.]]One aspect of research on the development of the mental lexicon has focused on vocabulary growth. Converging research suggests that at least English children learn several words a day throughout development. The figure at left illustrates the growth curve of a typical English-speaking child's vocabulary size.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;

The words acquired in the early stages of language development tend to be nouns or nounlike, and there are some similarities in first words across children (e.g., ''mama, daddy, dog'').&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt; [[Fast mapping]] is the idea that children may be able to gain at least partial information about the meaning of a word from how it is used in a sentence, what words it is contrasted with, as well as other factors. This allows the child to quickly hypothesize about the meaning of a word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heibeck|first=Tracy|author2=Ellen M. Markman|title=Word Learning in Children: An Examination of Fast Mapping|journal=Child Development|year=1987|volume=58|pages=1021–1034|doi=10.2307/1130543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that, despite the [[fast mapping]] hypothesis, words are not just learned as soon as we are exposed to them, each word needs some type of activation and/or acknowledgement before it is permanently and effectively stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Miller |first= G.A |year= 1986|title= Dictionaries in the mind |journal= Language and Cognitive Processes |volume= 1|issue=3 |pages=171–185 |doi=10.1080/01690968608407059}}&lt;/ref&gt; For young children, the word may be accurately stored in their mental lexicon, and they can recognize when an adult produces the incorrect version of the word, but they may not be able to produce the word accurately.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;{{Clear}}

As a child acquires their vocabulary, two separate aspects of the mental lexicon develop named the [[lexeme]] and the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]].&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt; The lexeme is defined as the part of the mental lexicon that stores morphological and formal information about a word, such as the different versions of spelling and pronunciation of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levelt | first=Willem| authorlink = Willem Levelt | title=Accessing Words in Speech Production: Stages, Processes and Representations|journal=Cognition|year=1992|volume=42|issue=1–3|pages=1–22|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(92)90038-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lemma is defined as the structure within the mental lexicon that stores semantic and syntactic information about a word, such as part of speech and the meaning of the word. Research has shown that the lemma develops first when a word is acquired into a child's vocabulary, and then with repeated exposure the lexeme develops.&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt;

[[File:Structure of a lexical entry.png|thumb|The Internal Structure of a Lexical Entry (adapted from [[Willem Levelt|Levelt]] 1989).]]

=== Bilingual development ===

The development of the mental lexicon in bilingual children has increased in research over recent years, and has shown many complexities including the notion that bilingual speakers contain additional and separate mental lexicons for their other languages. Selecting between two or more different lexicons has shown to have benefits extending past language processes. Bilinguals significantly outperform their monolingual counterparts on executive control tasks. Researchers suggest that this enhanced cognitive ability comes from continually choosing between L1 and L2 mental lexicons.&lt;ref name=bia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bialystok|first=Ellen|title=Reshaping the Mind: The Benefits of Bilingualism|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2011|volume=65|issue=4|pages=229–235|doi=10.1037/a0025406|pmc=4341987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilinguals have also shown resilience against the onset of Alzheimer's disease, monolinguals being an average of 71.4 years old and the bilinguals 75.5 years old when symptoms of dementia were detected, a difference of 4.1 years.&lt;ref name=bia /&gt;

==Brain==
Studies have shown that the [[temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobe|parietal]] lobes in the left hemisphere are particularly relevant for the processing of lexical items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pulvermüller, F. | title = Nouns and verbs in the intact brain: Evidence from event-related potentials and high-frequency cortical responses | journal = Tübingen: Oxford Journals | volume = 9 | pages = 497–506 | year = 1999 | doi=10.1093/cercor/9.5.497}} http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/5/497.short&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some hypotheses pertaining to semantic comprehension in the brain:

# '''Organized Unitary Content Hypothesis (OUCH):''' this hypothesis posits that lexical items that co-occur with high frequency are stored in the same area in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adorni, R. |author2=Proverbio, A. | title = New insights into name category-related effects: is the age of acquisition a possible factor? | journal = Milan: BioMed Central | volume = 5 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmc=2726156 | pmid=19640289 | doi=10.1186/1744-9081-5-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Domain-Specific Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis uses the theory of evolution to posit that certain categories that have an evolutionary advantage over others (such as useful items like tools) have their specialized and functionally dissociated neural circuits in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;
# '''Sensory/Functional Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis posits that the ability to identify (i.e. be able to recognize and name) living things depends on visual information, while the ability to identify non-living things depends on functional information. Thus this hypothesis implies that modality-specific subsystems compose an overarching semantic network of lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;

==Impaired access ==

[[Anomic aphasia]], [[aphasia]] ([[expressive aphasia|expressive]] + [[receptive aphasia]]) and [[Alzheimer's disease]] can all affect recalling or retrieving words.  Anomia renders a person completely unable to name familiar objects, places and people,&lt;ref name = "Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speech-therapy-on-video.com/receptiveaphasia.html |title=Improving Receptive Aphasia: Your Source of Information and solutions |publisher=Speech-therapy-on-video.com |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a involves specific naming difficulties; sufferers of anomia have difficulties recalling words.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Anomia is a lesser level of dysfunction, a severe form of the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon where the brain cannot recall the desired word.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Stroke, head trauma and brain tumors can cause anomia.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt;

Expressive and receptive aphasia are neurological language disorders.&lt;ref name = "Diseases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alldiseases.org/what-is-a-dysnomia/ |title=What Is A Dysnomia? |publisher=Alldiseases.org |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive aphasia limits the ability to convey thoughts through the use of speech, language or writing.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Receptive aphasia affects a person's ability to comprehend spoken words, causing disordered sentences that have little or no meaning and which can include addition of [[nonce words]].&lt;ref name = "Diseases"/&gt;

Harry Whitaker states that Alzheimer's disease patients are forgetful of proper names. Patients have difficulty generating names, especially with phonological tasks such as words starting with a certain letter.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"&gt;{{cite book | author = Whitaker, Harry A | title = Concise Encyclopedia of Brain and Language  | chapter =  Alzheimer's Disease | pages = 19–22| location = Oxford, UK: Elsevier Ltd | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have word-retrieval difficulties in spontaneous speech but still have relatively preserved naming of presented stimuli.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"/&gt; Later, loss of naming of low-frequency lexical items occurs. Eventually, the loss of ability to comprehend and name the same lexical item indicates semantic loss of the lexical item.

== Shrinking ==

The majority of current research focuses on the acquisition and functioning of the mental lexicon, without much focus on what happens to the mental lexicon over time. Current studies suggest that as individuals age, they become less capable of storing and remembering words indicating that their "mental dictionary" is, in fact, shrinking. One study showed that the size of a Japanese woman's healthy mental lexicon of kanji shrank at a rate of approximately 1% per year between ages 83 and 93 on average. This was tested through a simple naming task once when the subject was 83, and then again at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time |year=2010|volume=25|issue=1|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==

===Storage of acronyms===

As research on the mental lexicon continues to expand into our modern world of abbreviations, researchers have begun to question whether the mental lexicon has the capacity to store acronyms as well as words. Using a lexical decision task with acronyms as priming words, researchers saw that acronyms could in fact prime other related information. This finding suggests that acronyms are stored alongside their related information in the mental lexicon just as a word would be. Research also demonstrated that these acronyms would still prime related information despite inaccurate capitalization (i.e. bbc had the same priming effects as BBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brysbaert|first=M|author2=S Speybroeck |author3=D Vanderelst |title=Is there room for the BBC in the mental lexicon? On the recognition of acronyms.|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2009|volume=62|issue=9|pages=1832–1842|doi=10.1080/17470210802585471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2964">'''Noddy headshots''' or '''noddies ''' are a type of camera shot used in recorded news or current affairs interviews. The noddies consist of nods and other similar "listening gestures" made by the interviewer. If only one camera is available at the interview site, then these shots are recorded after the actual interview takes place. The shots are spliced into the interview during the editing process to mask any cuts that have been made. This editing technique is universally "read" by audiences as expressing realism and therefore creates the illusion of a seamless dialogue in the interview.

The earliest use of the term recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates from 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=noddy, ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |edition=online  |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/240498?result=6&amp;rskey=EX8zqe&amp; }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was explained more fully by [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] in 1987: "the camera is then turned onto the interviewer who asks some of the questions again and gives a series of "noddies," that is, reaction shots, nods, smiles, or expressions of sympathetic listening. These are then used to disguise later edits in the interviewee's speech... Without the "noddy", the visuals would show an obvious "jump" that would reveal the edit."&lt;ref&gt;Fiske 1987, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversial use ==

In the United Kingdom, the term came to public prominence in 2007 when it was revealed that a BBC programme inserted noddies featuring the senior broadcaster [[Alan Yentob]] into interviews that he did not conduct, creating the impression that he had been present.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/07/bbc.television1&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy, which was covered in many newspapers as ''Noddygate'', came at a time when the BBC was already under scrutiny for falsifying certain aspects of entertainment shows for editorial reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">An '''open-ended question''' cannot be answered with a "yes" or "no" response, or with a static response. Open-ended questions are phrased as a statement which requires a response. The response can be compared to information that is already known to the questioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ackley | first = Betty | title = Nursing diagnosis handbook : an evidence-based guide to planning care | publisher = Mosby | location = Maryland Heights, Mo | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780323071505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of open-ended questions:
*Tell me about your relationship with your supervisor.  
*How do you see your future?
*Tell me about the children in this photograph.
*What is the purpose of government?
*Why did you choose that answer?
*Tap?

== Education: open questioning ==
The received wisdom in education is that open questions are broadly speaking ‘good’ questions. They invite students to give longer responses that demonstrate their understanding. They are preferable to [[Closed-ended question|closed questions]] (i.e. one that demands a yes/no answer) because they are better for discussions or enquiries, whereas closed questions are only good for knowledge testing. 

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are “grammatically closed, but conceptually open”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2016-12-03|title=Ariadne’s Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in standard parlance, ‘is it ever right to lie?’ would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes/no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes/no answer to it can be ‘opened up’ by the questioner (‘why do you think that?,’ ‘Could there be an instance where that’s not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry. 

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, “gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=2017-04-19|work=Tes|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Closed questions, simply require ‘opening up’ strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential. 

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention 'Open Questioning Mindset', or OQM. OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student’s contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls ‘guess what’s in my head’ teaching, that relies on [[Closed-ended question|closed]] and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2015-11-29|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4938">'''Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember''' is a [[traveling exhibition]] that explores the [[history]] of [[disability]] within the lives of Canadians.

The exhibition was produced in collaboration with students, scholars and [[alumni]] from the School of Disability Studies at [[Ryerson University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofu.ryerson.ca/about/index.html |title=Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember |publisher=Ryerson University |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition originated from a special topic seminar designed to uncover the hidden history of disability in Canada. Each student identified an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] to explore that represented a particular moment in Canadian disability history. Thirteen objects were then selected for the exhibition, revealing [[narratives]] that pay homage to the resilience, creativity, and the civic and cultural contributions of Canadians with disabilities. Accompanying interpretive texts help confront [[stereotypical]] representations of disability such as [[pity]], [[wikt:inspiration|inspiration]] or [[freak]], helping to illustrate the complexity of disability struggles for social and political acknowledgement, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], survival and remembrance.

Out from Under is curated by three [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members from Ryerson University’s School of [[Disability Studies]].

==Exhibition components==
Each objects’ history is represented by a single word title: Digging, Labouring, Dressing, Fixing, Measuring, Naming, Breathing, Remembering, Packing, Trailblazing, Struggling, Leading and Aspiring.

The '''Paley Center for Media''', formerly the '''Museum of Television &amp; Radio''' ('''MT&amp;R''') and the '''Museum of Broadcasting''', founded in 1975 by [[William S. Paley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paleycenter.org/about-mission-history-history/ "History"] Paley Center for Media website&lt;/ref&gt; is an American cultural institution in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]] dedicated to the discussion of the cultural, creative, and social significance of television, radio, and emerging platforms for the professional community and media-interested public.

It was renamed The Paley Center for Media on June 5, 2007, to encompass emerging broadcasting technologies such as the [[Internet]], [[mobile video]], and [[podcasting]], as well as to expand its role as a neutral setting where media professionals can engage in discussion and debate about the evolving media landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtr.inet7.com/PressRoom/pressRelease/060507.htm "The Museum of Television &amp; Radio announces new name"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609200514/http://mtr.inet7.com/PressRoom/pressRelease/060507.htm |date=2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
With an ever-growing collection of content [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on [[radio]] and [[television]], the Paley Center has two branches; in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The New York City branch is in the heart of [[Midtown Manhattan]] at 25 West [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] between [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|5th]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Avenues]]. The Los Angeles branch is located at 465 N [[Beverly Drive]] in [[Beverly Hills]], near [[Rodeo Drive]].

===New York===
The original Museum of Broadcasting, founded in 1975 by William S. Paley, opened in Manhattan on November 9, 1976, occupying two floors in an office building at 1 East 53rd Street, near the corner of 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue. This was adjacent to the Doubleday Book Store on Fifth Avenue.

The Museum of Broadcasting's name was changed to The Museum of Television &amp; Radio with the September 12, 1991 move into the William S. Paley Building. Designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and located at 25 West 52nd Street (adjacent to the famed [[21 Club]] at 21 West 52nd Street), the 16-story building was itself renamed The Paley Center for Media in 2007. It has two front entrances: the one on the left is for office staff, and the main entrance on the right for the general public. The [[Alexander Mackendrick]] film ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957) has an exterior location scene with different angles revealing how the neighborhood looked in the years before the building was constructed.

The ground-level floor of the New York museum features the ticket and information area and the [[Steven Spielberg]] Gallery, used for exhibitions, receptions and fund-raising events. Reservations to use the Library are made at the front desk. In addition to the elevator, a staircase on the first floor leads down to the large basement-level theater. The fourth floor has numerous computers, used by visitors to locate programming in the collection. When a selection is made, it can be watched on the computer.  Computers are available both for individuals and for groups.

===Los Angeles===
The Museum of Television &amp; Radio in Los Angeles at 465 North Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, opened March 18, 1996 in a new building designed by [[Richard Meier]] and named for [[Leonard H. Goldenson]]. When the Los Angeles building opened, it featured a collection duplicated from the tapes in the New York collection. Rooms are named for the celebrity sponsors: the [[Danny Thomas]] Lobby, the [[Aaron Spelling]] Reception Area and the [[Garry Marshall]] Pool. Screenings are held in the 150-seat [[John H. Mitchell]] Theatre. The Ahmanson Radio Listening Room has headphones for use with five pre-programmed channels.

==Archives==
The Paley Center for Media is committed to the idea that many television and radio programs are significant works and should be preserved for posterity's sake. Instead of collecting [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[memorabilia]], the Paley Center comprises mostly screening rooms, including two full-sized theaters. Nearly 160,000 television shows, commercials, and radio programs are available in the Paley Center's library, and during each visit, viewers can select and watch shows at individual consoles, and radio programs are accessed through these same consoles.

Some television programs are from the 1940s with radio programs dating back to the 1920s. The earliest TV program in the Museum's collection is a silent film of NBC's 1939 production of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s melodrama ''The Streets of New York'' (1857), with [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]], [[George Coulouris]], and [[Jennifer Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Michael. (1994) ''Please Stand By''. Overlook Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum does not sell the material or permit it to leave the premises. Viewing copies of television programs are [[8 mm video format|Hi-8mm video tape]] dubs. The originals are kept in a vault outside of New York City, and the collection is being digitized.&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, Elizabeth. (June 5, 2007) [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/arts/design/05pale.html?ex=1338696000&amp;en=40d8832d1846f00c&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss/ "New Name and Mission for Museum of Television"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Paley Center has acquired many lost episodes of classic television shows and has produced [[Documentary film|documentary]] features about the history and impact of television and radio. In recent years, the Center has sponsored advance viewing of the [[pilot episodes]] of each network's new programs.

[[File:Melissa &amp; Joey cast and crew at Paley Center.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The cast and crew of ''[[Melissa &amp; Joey]]'' at an "Onstage @ Paley LA" event]]

Television and radio shows are added to the collection after archival discoveries and through donations from individuals and organizations. In 2002, the Museum held a showing of the previously unseen rehearsal film of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'' telecast from March 17, 1957.  This rehearsal was found in the [[CBS]] vault while the Museum was on a quest for other "lost" ''Cinderella'' materials. It had been believed that on the night of the live broadcast the show was preserved on both [[kinescope]] and [[videotape]] and then transmitted to the West Coast. Seeking either of these, Jane Klain, the Director of Research at the New York facility, asked CBS to search their vaults. The CBS database listed three 16mm films featuring five-minute segments of [[Julie Andrews]] performing in the show. When the earliest one was brought from the CBS vault, it was discovered to be the full dress rehearsal.

The Center is also known for its many discoveries involving daytime [[game show]]s. Episodes of [[wiping|destroyed]] shows such as ''[[High Rollers]]'', ''[[Celebrity Sweepstakes]]'', ''[[The Money Maze]]'', the [[Chuck Woolery]] version of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US daytime game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[To Say the Least]]'', and daytime ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' episodes are all available for viewing in the library. Episodes of other game shows such as ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', and ''[[The Gong Show]]'' are also in the library.

==Programming and education==
Seminars and interviews with public figures are conducted frequently, all of which are recorded and available for later viewing on individual consoles. Past seminar participants have included [[Lucille Ball]], [[Carol Burnett]], [[Dick Cavett]], [[Alan Alda]], [[Al Franken]], [[John Frankenheimer]], [[James Garner]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Roy Huggins]], [[Jack Paar]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Dick Van Dyke]], and [[Gore Vidal]]. Also available for viewing are seminars featuring creators and cast members from TV shows, including ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', and ''[[The League]]''. Panel discussions have varied from what it was like to work with [[Orson Welles]] to a celebration of [[Roy Huggins]]'s career.

PaleyFest, also known as the William S. Paley Television Festival, is an annual television festival hosted by the Paley Center in the Los Angeles area. Founded in 1984, the festival, held annually in the spring, features panels composed of the casts and prominent creative talent from popular television shows such as ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', ''[[Parks and Recreation (TV series)|Parks and Recreation]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'', and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', among many others.

The festival has been in many venues over its history, including the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] Bing Theater, the [[Directors Guild of America]] theater, the [[Cinerama Dome]], and the [[Saban Theatre]] in Beverly Hills.

===Media Advanced Management Program===
In 2010, The Paley Center for Media announced a partnership with [[IESE Business School]] to offer the Advanced Management Program in Media and Entertainment or the "Media AMP", a postgraduate level program for media and entertainment executives to preparing them for high level leadership roles in their companies.  Launched in January 2011, the program’s goal is to bring executives up to speed on new business models, management techniques, and technologies. A key feature is access to leaders in the industry.

The Media AMP curriculum covers four modules over a six-month period. Three of the modules are held in New York, and one in Los Angeles. Key discussion topics include:  Value Creation; Digital Strategy; Accounting, Finance and Management Control; Content and Customers; Leadership; Production, Technology and Operations Management; Entrepreneurship and Innovation; IT Systems and Strategy; Managerial Economics and Decision Analysis; Marketing Strategy; and others.

[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], [[National Gallery, London]] 1434.  Among other changes, his face was higher by about the height of his eye, hers was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front.  Each of his feet was underdrawn in one position, painted in another, and then overpainted in a third.  These alterations are seen in infra-red reflectograms.]]
A '''pentimento''' (plural '''pentimenti''') is an alteration in a painting, evidenced by traces of previous work, showing that the artist has changed their mind as to the composition during the process of painting. The word is [[Italian language|Italian]] for ''repentance,'' from the verb ''[[wikt:pentirsi|pentirsi]]'', meaning to repent.

==Significance==
Pentimenti may show that a composition originally had an element, for example a head or a hand, in a slightly different place, or that an element no longer in the final painting was originally planned.  The changes may have been done in the [[underdrawing]] of the painting, or by the visible layers of paint differing from the underdrawing, or by the first painted treatment of the element having been over-painted.

Some pentimenti have always been visible on the final painting with careful inspection; others are revealed by the increasing transparency that some paint acquires after several centuries. Others, especially in the underdrawing, can only be seen with modern methods such as [[X-ray]]s and [[Infrared reflectography#Art history|infrared reflectography]] and photographs.  These are able to record photographically some [[pigment]]s, depending on their chemical composition, which remain covered by later paint layers. For example, [[white lead]], a common pigment, will be detected by X-ray, and [[carbon black]] underdrawings can often be seen with great clarity in infra-red reflectograms.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221432/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/72881.html] These methods have greatly expanded the number of pentimenti art historians are aware of, and confirmed that they are very common in the works of many [[old master]]s, from [[Jan van Eyck]] onwards.
[[File:OldGuitaristLady.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The face of the woman in the image that ''[[The Old Guitarist]] ''is painted over. These marks would not usually be described as ''pentimenti'' as the subjects are totally different]]

Pentimenti are considered especially important when considering whether a particular painting is the first version by the original artist, or a second version by the artist himself, or his workshop, or a later copyist. Normally secondary versions or copies will have few if any pentimenti, although this will not always be the case, as in ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'' by [[Caravaggio]].  Like [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] and many other masters, Caravaggio seems rarely to have made preliminary drawings, but to have composed straight onto the canvas.  The number of pentimenti found in the work of such masters naturally tends to be higher.

Marks revealing a totally different subject, for example in ''[[The Old Guitarist]] ''by [[Picasso]], are not usually described as pentimenti - the artist has abandoned his ''earlier composition'' to begin a new one. In cases where a composition has been changed by a later painter or restorer, marks showing the original composition would not be described as pentimenti either—it must be the original painter who has changed his mind.

==Usage in English==
The term is usually treated as an Italian word and therefore written in italics, depending on the style used in the individual context.  The fully anglicised word ''pentiment'' (plural ''pentiments'') is much rarer, though included in the [[Grove Dictionary of Art]].  The distinction between singular and plural is also rather flexible; some writers refer to a change of just one outline as ''pentimenti'', whilst others treat each area that has been changed as a single ''pentimento''. The word "pentimento" is occasionally used synonymously with "palimpsest", but strictly the latter is used for documents and parchments which, due to fading, have been reused.

==Examples==
[[File:Cardsharps.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caravaggio]], ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|The Cardsharps]]'' in the [[Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth]].]]
[[File:La casa de Nazaret, por Zurbarán.jpg|thumb|right|''Christ and the Virgin in the House at Nazareth'' by [[Zurbarán]], Cleveland.]]
A portrait in the [[National Gallery, London]] of Jacques de Norvins by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] was painted in 1811–12 when the sitter was [[Napoleon]]'s Chief of Police in Rome. Originally, instead of the curtain at the left, there was a fully painted bust of a boy's head on top of a small column.  Probably this was a bust of Napoleon's son, who was known as the King of Rome. The presumption is that this was overpainted with the curtain after the fall of Napoleon, either by Ingres himself, or another artist.&lt;ref&gt;The National Gallery, Complete Illustrated Catalogue, National Gallery Publications, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85709-050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bust can just be made out in the enlarged online photo, with its chin level with the sitter's hair-line; the top of the column was level with the middle of the sitter's ear.  These may always have been (just) visible, or have become so by the paint becoming transparent with age.  Few viewers of the painting would notice the bust without it being pointed out.  Strictly speaking, these alterations might not be described as pentimenti, because of the presumed lapse of time, and because another artist may have made the change.[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3291]

An example by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] can be found in his work ''[[Leonardo Da Vinci|Salvator Mundi]]'', which was sold to a private collector for more than $450 million after being restored by Christie's auction house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/leonardo-da-vinci-painting-salvator-mundi-sells-for-450-3-million-1510794281|title=Leonardo da Vinci Painting ‘Salvator Mundi’ Smashes Records With $450.3 Million Sale|first=Kelly|last=Crow|date=16 November 2017|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another work  by [[Caravaggio]], ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|The Cardsharps]]'' in the [[Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth]], has a number of typical minor pentimenti, altering the position of the figure on the right, which are revealed by infra-red reflectograms.  These are used in discussing the painting and comparing it to another version of the subject in [[Bari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kimbellart.org/database/conservation.cfm?acquisition_id=AP%201987.06 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001114100/http://www.kimbellart.org/database/conservation.cfm?acquisition_id=AP%201987.06 |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Zurbarán]] in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] shows that the size of a white cloth was expanded after the dark background under-paint had been applied; the expanded area is a darker white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/zurPent.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221750/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/zurPent.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, as a result of the discovery of pentimenti after conservation and cleaning, the [[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld Institute]] changed its opinion on its version of Manet’s ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' from that of it being a copy to  it being a preparatory painting that predates the version in the Louvre. Pentimenti were visible once the old varnish was removed, including alterations to the curve of the back of the female nude and one of the male figure's cap, suggesting that the Courtauld picture is a preparatory work.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Baily, "London version of Manet’s Le déjeuner sur l’herbe predates the bigger picture in Paris", The Art Newspaper, 26 Nov 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term has sometimes been used in a modern sense to describe the appearance of the sides of buildings with painted advertising.  Often old ads are painted over with newer ads and the paint wears away to reveal the older layers. Examples in [[Amsterdam]], [[New York City]] and elsewhere have been photographed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fadingad.com/009.html|title=Amsterdam Ediglyph|last=Jump|first=Frank H.|date=2008-02-28|website=www.fadingad.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankjump.com|title=Fading Ad Campaign|website=www.frankjump.com|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Method acting]] is employed by actors to evoke realistic emotions into their performance by drawing on personal experiences. Raymond Hamden, doctor of Clinical and Forensic Psychology, defines the purpose of method acting as “compartmentalizing their own feelings while playing another character [so] they could bring the emotions of that personal feeling to cry if they needed to with that character.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when these emotions are not compartmentalized, they can encroach on other facets of life, often seeming to disrupt the actor’s psyche. This occurs as the actor delves into previous emotional experiences, be they joyful or traumatic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological effects, like emotional fatigue, comes when suppressed or unresolved raw emotions are unburied to add to the character,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; not just from the employing personal emotions in performance. The question becomes whether the actor calls up resolved or unresolved emotions in their acting.

== Psychological effects ==
The psychological effects of method acting vary in intensity from individual to individual. Some common effects include; 
*Fatigue
*Fear
*Anxiety
*Shame
*Sleep deprivation
*Personality changes
*Psychotic disorders.

Fatigue, or emotional fatigue, comes mainly when actors “create dissonance between their actions and their actual feelings.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A mode of acting referred to as “surface acting” involves only changing one’s actions without altering the deeper thought processes. Method acting, when employed correctly, is mainly deep acting, or changing thoughts as well as actions, proven to generally avoid excessive fatigue. Surface acting is statistically “positively associated with a negative mood and this explains some of the association of surface acting with increased emotional exhaustion.” &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idJudge|Judge, Timothy A. “Is Emotional Labor More Difficult for Some than for Others? A Multi-level, Experience-sampling Study.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; This negative mood that is created leads to fear, anxiety, feelings of shame and sleep deprivation.

Raw emotion or unresolved emotions conjured up for acting, may result in a sleep deprivation and the cyclical nature of the ensuing side effects. [[Sleep deprivation]] alone can lead to impaired function, causing some individuals to “acute episodes of psychosis.” Sleep deprivation initiates chemical changes in the brain that can lead to behavior similar to psychotic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes can lead to more lasting psychological damage. In cases where raw emotion that has not been resolved, or traumas have been evoked before closure has been reached by the individual, the emotion can result in greater emotional instability and increased sense of anxiety, fear or shame.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem seen in method acting comes from the inability of actors to compartmentalize the emotions of the character from their own in daily life. Generally the actors who suffer personality changes and psychotic disorders already have some psychotic tendencies or are emotionally unstable. Those who have [[dissociative identity disorder]] “can’t recognize that the role isn’t theirs” and, even though these individuals appear normal, they have psychotic disorders that sometimes take months to identify.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Dissociative identity disorder is a chemically based disorder that results from “high stress and trauma.” What these individuals experience psychologically can further detriment their chemical and physiological makeup.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor that is rarely discussed when observing the emotional effects of method acting is that the individuals that practice method acting may already be emotionally unstable. Dr. Hamden notes that “many actors have had a traumatic life, [and] acting gives [them] the opportunity to be someone else.” &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are already emotionally unstable and so the effects of method acting are more severe for them. It is only a minority of people, about 32%, that will have extreme traumatic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
In the professional acting field, most companies have a psychoanalyst that consults on films to give analysis and characteristics for characters. Their responsibility lies in aiding actors in understanding how the character would act. These professionals help when actors cannot relate. Their responsibility is to draw connections and pull raw emotions from the actor to connect with the character.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   

Under professional supervision, method acting proves safe and effective. Many actors find the practice of method acting cathartic, similar to psychiatrist Jacob L. Moreno’s [[psychodrama]]. In this technique, a professional aids in keeping the individual in alignment while they achieve closure for traumatic emotional damage. The harmful situations in method acting arise when there is no professional supervising the process, such as in “cult-like” weekend courses&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   provided by unqualified individuals that cannot monitor the individuals and keep them in alignment psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   

This would be evident in weekend courses where the instructor promises to instruct method acting to a large public class, sometimes as many as one hundred people. The instructor would then be incapable of meeting the psychological needs of each individual in the class. Harmful psychological effects arise “when control of necessary skill falls short, [and] the balance [shifts] to the negative.” This occurs “because the [psychological] risks are in fact greater than anticipated, or because unanticipated obstacles or hurdles arise.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The acting situation then becomes threatening and results in the unpleasant feelings of fear, anxiety or shame.

=== Correlation between acting and physiology ===
It is commonly believed that there is a strong correlation between acting and the physiological reaction to acting. According to the task-emotion theory, “the positive emotions of the actor should be coupled with a specific physiological activation. In particular, excited physical reactions were expected to co-exist with task-emotions such as tension, excitement, and challenge.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The emotion-task theory proposes that “the ‘action tendencies’ in characters occupy a special place and differ somewhat from [the] impulses in general behavior.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, studies have been done that show that the correlation between emotions and physical reactions are moderately weak. .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger comes when control precedence “manifests itself by sudden interruptions of behavior, changes in behavior or by persistence of [character’s] behavior.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   “Control precedence” by emotions is the “feelings, thoughts, impulses, actions or activation going along with aroused emotion that takes precedence over other planned or half executed thoughts, feelings, impulses, etc.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Control precedence is the main concern for method acting. It proves a challenge for actors to come out of character after employing method acting techniques, sometimes altering their behavior, urging them to follow impulses that would be foreign to their own personal nature. This difficulty of returning to one’s own behavior is the common concern linked with method acting.

'''''Rhema''''' (ῥῆμα in [[Koine Greek|Greek]]) literally means an "utterance" or "thing said" in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of linguistics'' by Mark Aronoff, Janie Rees-Miller 2003 {{ISBN|1-4051-0252-7}} page 83 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rl8LDiR11nYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a word that signifies the action of utterance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sophists (A History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. 3, Part 1)'' by W. K. C. Guthrie 1977 {{ISBN|0-521-09666-9}} page 220 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pDOqZfQ5tqUC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bvF4TLqoCoaG4Qb9zr27Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzg8#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], it was used by both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to refer to [[proposition]]s or sentences.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"/&gt;

In [[Christianity]], it is used in reference to the concept of ''Rhematos Christou''; Jesus Christ's sayings.

==Etymology==
The Greek noun [[wikt:ῥῆμα|ῥῆμα]] "saying, utterance, word, verb" is analyzed as consisting of the root ἐρ-/ῥε- (er-/rhe-) "say" (cf. [[wikt:εἴρω|εἴρω]] "I say"; ἐρῶ "I will say") and the suffix -μα (-ma), a suffix used to form nouns from verbs.

Both [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) used the terms ''logos'', ''rhema'' and ''onoma''. In Plato's usage, a [[logos]] (often translatable as a ''sentence'') is a sequence in which verbs are mingled with nouns and every logos must have an onoma and rhema. For Plato, every logos was either true or false and in a logos, names included rhema ''which denotes actions'' and onoma a ''mark set on those who do the actions''.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} page 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle identified three components as central to the proposition: ''onoma'', ''rhema'' and ''logos''. These terms are translated differently depending on the context of the discussion—grammar or logic, as in the table on the right. But it was only in the 12th century that grammarians began to think in terms of units we understand as ''subject'' and ''predicate''.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-56532-4}} page 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Septuagint usage==
The [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek uses the terms ''rhema'' and ''logos'' as equivalents and uses both for the [[Hebrew]] word ''[[dabar]]'', as the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 1'' by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich, Geoffrey William Bromiley 1985 {{ISBN|0-8028-2404-8}} page 508 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltZBUW_F9ogC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=dabar+rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nhR5TOrOBtuT4gbY9uyrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z'' by Geoffrey W.

==In Christianity==
{{Main article|Rhema (doctrine)}}
In Christianity, ''rhema'' is used in [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] to signify Jesus Christ's utterances.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The Greek word ''rhema'' is useful to distinguish between two meanings of ''word''. While both ''rhema'' and ''logos'' are translated into the English ''word'', in the original Greek there was a substantial distinction.

Some modern usage distinguishes ''rhema'' from ''logos'' in [[Christian theology]], with ''rhema'' at times called "spoken word",&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; referring to the revelation received by disciples when the  [[Holy Spirit]] "speaks" to them.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;''What Every Christian Ought to Know'' by Adrian Rogers 2005 {{ISBN|0-8054-2692-2}} page 162 [https://books.google.com/books?id=W0os7ZiHsf0C&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Identified Life of Christ'' by Joe Norvell 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-294-3}} page [https://books.google.com/books?id=3FAhz_eshkMC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEp4TLvMKtH14AaetLmABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In this usage, "Logos" refers to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trinitarian controversy'' by William G.

A '''singing telegram''' is a message that is delivered by an [[artist]] in a musical form.  Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal [[telegram]]s, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing.  Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.

[[Western Union]], the American [[telegraph]] company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. That July 28, a fan sent Hollywood singing star [[Rudy Vallee]] a birthday greeting by telegram. [[George P. Oslin]] (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular.  He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | title = Special delivery: The singing telegram endures | newspaper = Columbia News Service | date = July 7, 2002 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108220256/http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | archivedate = November 8, 2006 | df =  | author=Liz Sadler }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought "that messages should be fun," he recalled that he "was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = George Oslin, 97, creator of the singing telegram | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = October 31, 1996 | page = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Western Union Tuning Out Singing Telegram | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 29, 1972 | page = 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.

==Variants==
A '''DIY singing telegram''' is a specially written song all about the person in karaoke DVD form, so that any singer anywhere in the world can deliver the fully personalised singing telegram.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Kissogram===
A '''kissogram''', also called '''kissagram''' (short for kissing [[telegram]]), is a [[message]] delivered along with a [[kiss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/kissogram |title=Definition of kissogram |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually arranged as a fun surprise for a person for a special occasion. Message deliverers can be hired either by themselves, or as part of an [[Employment agency|agency]]. A kissogram is usually presented by a performer dressed in a costume or uniform such as a [[police officer]], [[nurse]], [[french maid]] or [[nun]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This term was used in the TV program Doctor Who to describe the profession of Doctor Who's companion Amy Pond. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/doctor-who/news/a197176/new-who-companion-has-kissogram-job/|title=New 'Who' companion 'has kissogram job'|date=2010-01-18|work=Digital Spy|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stripogram===
A '''stripogram''' or '''strippergram'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strippergram|title=strippergram - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of message delivery in which a [[stripper]] will perform a [[striptease]] while singing or dancing.  The word is a combination of [[telegram]] and striptease.  This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to the UK and Europe during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thecelebratedmisterk|title=Newsroom Stripper|date=2012-03-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lusr48t3cBM|accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a [[birthday]], [[anniversary]] or [[bachelor party]].  A common practice is for the stripper-gram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some form of charade connected with this, before commencing their act - for example a police officer 'arresting' somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended 'victim' has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law). Usually a Strip-o-gram entertainer is accompanied by a chaperone, who plays her music, holds on to the money, tips and secures her safety. Unlike an escort who comes alone and does more of a one on one with the celebrant and is not chaperoned. Now-a-days, some agencies or performers do both to secure a bigger pay out.

==Star System==
In the early 1980s, a collaboration of independent singing telegrams companies in the U.S. was formed by Larry Balsamo, Hey!Wires Sing Telegrams in Chicago. Similar to [[Florists' Transworld Delivery]], the Star System was a referral system for people to send a singing telegram to friends and family throughout the United States.

==In popular culture==
In the 1976 season 5, episode 1 of The Bob Newhart Show, Bob receives a singing telegram announcing a visit from his college roommate and his new wife.  

In the 1985 movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Sam Lowry ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) received an invitation to his mother's party via singing telegram. When told the message had been sent Reply Paid, he attempted to sing his reply.

In ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'', 1985, a singing telegram ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) arrives and is shot on the doorstep. She is later revealed to be a secret blackmail informant. 

In a classic episode of [[Sesame Street]], Grover poses as a singing telegram artist. He goes up to [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]] singing a series of singing telegrams not directed for him until he eventually gives him the right telegram. The telegram is about Mr. Johnson's hat being found by someone in Buffalo, New York, but to Mr. Johnson's dismay, Grover forgets who sent the telegram.

In the 1987 [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]] episode "Soft Touch", [[Penny Parker]] ([[Teri Hatcher]]) tries her hand at being a singing telegram deliveryperson. But due to her forgetfully visiting the wrong address, she happens to witness two thugs torturing a man.

In ''[[The Fisher King]]'', 1991, Parry ([[Robin Williams]]) sends a singing telegram ([[Michael Jeter]]) to Lydia, the love interest in her office.

In the 2010 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]", the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor's]] [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Amy Pond]] worked delivering kissograms, prior to traveling with the Doctor.

Within the linguistic study of [[endangered languages]], sociolinguists distinguish between different '''speaker types''' based on the type of [[Competence (linguistics)|competence]] they have acquired of the endangered language. Often in situations where a community is gradually shifting away from an endangered language to a majority language, not all speakers acquire full linguistic competence, but have varying degrees and types of competence depending on the kind of exposure to the minority language they experienced in their upbringing. Originally the relevance of speaker types in situations of language shift was noted by [[Nancy Dorian]] who coined the term [[semi-speaker]] to refer to those speakers of Sutherland Gaelic who were predominantly English-speaking and whose Gaelic competence was limited and showed considerable influence from English.&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, N. C. (1977). The problem of the semi-speaker in language death. Linguistics, 15(191), 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, N. C. (1980). Language shift in community and individual: The phenomenon of the laggard semi-speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 1980(25), 85-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies added additional speaker types such as [[Speaker types#Typology|rememberers]] (who remember some words and phrases but have little or no grammatical competence and do not actively speak the language), [[Passive speaker (language)|passive speakers]] (who have nearly full comprehension competence but do not actively speak the language). In the context of language revitalization, [[new speakers]] who have learned the endangered language as a second language are sometimes distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Hornsby, Michael. "The “new” and “traditional” speaker dichotomy: bridging the gap." International Journal of the Sociology of Language 2015, no. 231 (2015): 107-125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Colette. "Speakers and documentation of endangered languages." Language documentation and description 1 (2003): 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Collette &amp; Michel Bert. 2011. "Speakers and Communities" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88215-6}}. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

In contexts of language acquisition and language teaching studies sometimes there is a distinction between [[native speakers]] and [[Second language|second language speakers]], depending on whether language was learned as a language of primary socialisation or learned after already having fully acquired a first language. In contexts of [[multilingualism]] a bilingual speaker may also be described as a [[heritage speaker]] (A heritage language actually refers to a language whose speakers have moved from the original area where the language was spoken: e.g. Welsh is a heritage language in Patagonia, but not in Wales) if they have not been as fully exposed to one of their languages, leading to a diminished degree of confidence in themselves as speakers, and sometimes also limited competence in one of their languages.

==Typology==
A '''rememberer''' is a person who knows individual words or phrases (sometimes entire texts) but cannot use the target language productively. Such persons are of particular interest when studying any [[Endangered language|endangered]] or [[Language death|dying language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages|last = Grinevald|first = Colette|authorlink=Colette Grinevald|publisher = Cambridge|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 51|url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/colloques/3l_2012/pageweb/pdf/Grinevald%20&amp;%20Bert2011-Speakers&amp;Community.pdf|last2 = Bert|first2 = Michel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rememberers are contrasted with [[fluency|fluent]] or full speakers, who have a good command of the language, and [[semi-speaker]]s, who have a partial command of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Research Methods in Linguistics|last = Podesva|first = Robert J.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107696358|location = |pages = 52|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gU5kAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=rememberer+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LQ3k8zd5F9&amp;sig=fqDd-Vf1laDbkOva58-pc6A6oo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PgCyVNWNEsGwogTf_IHwAw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rememberer%20linguistics&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between fluent speakers and rememberers is important in fieldwork, but accurately determining where a member of a language community falls on the speaker-rememberer continuum can be challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Descriptive Linguistic Fieldwork|last = Chelliah|first = Shobhana L.|authorlink=Shobhana Chelliah|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2010|isbn = 978-9048190256|location = |pages = 176–177|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d1FfE30hZ7EC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=rememberer+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kBdn4yvVFI&amp;sig=cxxXaXUZDLl_0jvg16rehWK72F0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TgKyVLXlEtLloASOuoHYCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rememberer%20linguistics&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Passive speaker (language)|passive speaker]] (also referred to as a ''receptive bilingual'' or ''passive bilingual'') is someone who has had enough exposure to a language in childhood to have a [[native speaker|native-like]] comprehension of it, but has little or no active command of it. Such speakers are especially common in [[language shift]] communities where speakers of a declining language do not acquire active competence. Around 10% of the [[Ainu people]], for example, who speak the language are considered passive speakers. Passive speakers are often targeted in [[language revival]] efforts to increase the number of speakers of a language quickly, as they are likely to gain active and near-native speaking skills more quickly than those with no knowledge of the language. They are also found in areas where people grow up hearing another language outside their family with no formal education.

A '''semi-speaker''' is a speaker who has acquired a partial [[linguistic competence]] in a given language, but who does not generally use it regularly in conversation. Their speech can contain erroneous forms. Semi-speakers are often among the most motivated and engaged participants in language revitalization projects.&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Collette &amp; Michel Bert. 2011. "Speakers and Communities" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88215-6}}. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;  As languages become obsolete and [[speech community|speech communities]] shift to other languages, they are spoken less frequently and in fewer social domains. Many speakers learn the language partially, often in a simplified way, with significant influence from the majority language. They are sometimes referred to as "semi-speakers", "quasi-speakers" or "rememberers". The word semi-speaker was introduced by linguist [[Nancy Dorian]] in describing the last speakers of the East Sutherland dialect of [[Scottish Gaelic]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, Nancy C. 1980. Language Shift in Community and Individual: The Phenomenon of the Laggard Semi-Speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Vol. 1980, Iss. 25, Pages 85–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Dorian, "The Problem of the Semi-Speaker in Language Death," International Journal of the Sociology of Language 12 (1977): 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  When semi-speakers form a significant part of the speech, community [[language death|language contraction]] often ensues, as the linguistic norms are accommodated to the competences of the speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knowles-Berry |first=Susan |date=Winter 1987 |title=Linguistic decay in Chontal Mayan: the speech of semi-speakers |journal=Anthropological Linguistics |volume=29 |number=4 |pages=332–341 |jstor=30028108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorian |first=Nancy C. |date=September 1978 |title=Fate of morphological complexity in language death: Evidence from East Sutherland Gaelic |journal=Language |volume=54 |number=3 |pages=590–609 |jstor=412788 |doi=10.1353/lan.1978.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''terminal speaker''' is the last speaker of a language. A terminal speaker may still be alive, or may have been the last person speaking what is now an [[extinct language]].&lt;ref&gt;Polinsky, Maria. 1995. Cross-linguistic parallels in language loss. ''Southwest Journal of Linguistics'' 14.1-2 pp. 87-123.&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of [[language death]], the remaining speakers begin to lose some of the vocabulary and grammar of the language, so when there is only a last terminal speaker, the person will not remember a complete form of the language as it had been spoken by a larger community using it in all language domains. Being a terminal speaker means that the person is bilingual, remembering their [[heritage language]] but interacting with their community in another language. The importance of this distinction is seen in the story of [[Dolly Pentreath]] of [[Cornwall]]. She is popularly named as the last fluent, first-language speaker of [[Cornish language|Cornish]], but there were others who still spoke it for many years, though possibly incompletely. Terminal speakers are sometimes found by linguists doing [[language documentation]] on a language before it dies. A clear example of a terminal speaker being contacted by a linguist is the case of Abegaz, the last speaker of the [[Mesmes language]] in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Ahland, Michael Bryan. (2010). ''Language death in Mesmes''. Dallas: SIL International and the University of Texas at Arlington.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in an isolated hilly area and was about 80 years old when he was contacted by a team of sociolinguistic [[language survey]]ors; he has died since that contact.  [[Ned Maddrell]] was the last speaker of the [[Manx language]], having died in 1974. In 2008, Doris McLemore was reported to be the last speaker of the [[Wichita language]] as she worked with a team of linguists to document the language before it died completely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18532656 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt; Many more terminal speakers are listed under the Wikipedia category [[List of last known speakers of languages|Last known speakers of a language]].

The name refers to the fact that the participants will attempt to "[[spin (public relations)|spin]]" or influence the perception of the debate among the assembled reporters. The benefit for reporters is that they quickly get in-person interviews with debaters or their representatives, complete with audio, video and photos. For a [[United States presidential election debates|U.S. presidential debate]], the number of reporters in the spin room can number into the thousands.&lt;ref name="TwitterSpin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Calderone|first=Michael|title=For 2012 Presidential Debates, Campaigns Speed Up The Spin|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/2012-presidential-debates-spin-room_n_1929185.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest known spin room was set up by the [[political campaign|campaign]] of U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. In a hotel banquet room, campaign officials spoke on the record with [[talking point]]s playing up their own candidate's debate performance and minimizing opponent [[Walter Mondale]]'s success, despite many observers believing Mondale had just won. This operation was dubbed the "spin patrol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santini|first=Maureen|title='Spin patrol' spins out|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=toNGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2229,1288893|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=The Evening News|date=13 October 1984|agency=The Associated Press|location=Newburgh-Beacon, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
A spin room may also be active before a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Zeke|title=Before The Spin Room, Campaigns Pre-Wash The Press|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/before-the-spin-room-campaigns-pre-wash-the-press|work=BuzzFeed|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of pre-debate spin is for each side to try to raise expectations for the opposing debater and lower expectations for their own team, a pursuit known as playing the [[expectations game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Leigh Ann|title=What's behind the debate expectations game?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57529085/whats-behind-the-debate-expectations-game/|work=CBS News|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some observers have criticized the overt nature of the [[media manipulation]] in spin rooms, and the media's willing participation in it.&lt;ref name="TribCritic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jay|title=Raze Spin Alley, That Strange Creation of the Press|url=http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/11/22/spin_alley.html|work=PressThink|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=22 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanson|first=Jerry|title=The spin room - oily engine of the political meat grinder|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1212/p11s01-coop.htm|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=12 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders have said reporters know it's scripted and aren't persuaded by the spin, but rather, they use the talking points to analyze candidates' strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardman|first1=Isabel|title=A (partial) defence of the spin room|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/a-partial-defence-of-the-spin-room/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin rooms can occasionally include moments of candor, such as when presidential candidate [[Rick Perry]] admitted that he had "stepped in it" during a debate response that became known as his [[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012#November 2011: "Oops" moment and continued struggles|"oops" moment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perry in spin room explains flub: "I stepped in it" (with video)|url=http://blogs.star-telegram.com/politex/2011/11/perry-in-spin-room-explains-flub-i-stepped-in-it-with-video.html|website=PoliTex|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin rooms have also been portrayed as outdated in an era of instant online reaction from all quarters before a debate is even over.&lt;ref name="TwitterSpin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaudin|first=Sharon|title=Twitter becomes new debate spin room|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232060/Twitter_becomes_new_debate_spin_room|work=Computer World|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Focus group]]s and instant post-debate "snap [[opinion poll|polls]]" attempt to provide a more scientific method than spin rooms in determining who has won a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US presidential debate: Early polls give Barack Obama slender victory|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/presidentialdebates/3092194/US-presidential-debate-Early-polls-give-Barack-Obama-slender-victory.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 October 2015|date=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clegg Beats Brown, Cameron in U.K. TV Debate, Polls Show|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-15/clegg-wins-top-mark-in-u-k-debate-polls-as-brown-cameron-stay-deadlocked.html|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 November 2012|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Grammatical categories}}

In [[linguistics]], the '''topic''', or '''theme''', of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the '''comment''' ('''rheme''' or '''focus''') is what is being said about the topic. This opposition of the given/new information is called [[information structure]]. That the [[information structure]] of a clause is divided in this way is generally agreed on, but the boundary between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus  depends on [[grammatical theory]]. 

The difference between "topic" and [[Subject (grammar)|grammatical subject]] is that topic is used to describe the information structure, or pragmatic structure of a clause and how it coheres with other clauses, whereas the subject is a purely grammatical category. ''Topic'' and ''subject'' must also be distinguished from ''actor'' (or ''agent''), the "doer". In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, for instance, the topic is typically the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition ''by''. In some languages, word order and other [[Syntax|syntactic phenomena]] are determined largely by the topic–comment (theme–rheme) structure. These languages are sometimes referred to as [[topic-prominent language]]s. Korean and Japanese are often given as examples of this.

The distinction was probably first suggested by [[Henri Weil]] in 1844&lt;ref&gt;H. Weil, De l’ordre des mots dans les langues anciennes compares aux
langues modernes: question de grammaire gnrale. Joubert, 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;. He established the
connection between [[information structure]] and word order. [[Georg von der Gabelentz]] distinguished '''psychological subject''' (roughly topic) and '''psychological object''' (roughly focus). In the [[Prague school]], the dichotomy, termed '''topic–focus articulation''', has been studied mainly by [[Vilém Mathesius]]&lt;ref&gt;V. Mathesius and J. Vachek, A Functional Analysis of Present Day
English on a General Linguistic Basis, ser. Janua linguarum : Series
practica / Ianua linguarum / Series practica. Mouton, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jan Firbas]], [[František Daneš]], [[Petr Sgall]] and [[Eva Hajičová]]. They have been concerned mainly by its relation to intonation and word-order. [[Mathesius]] also pointed that the topic does not provide new information but connects the sentence to the context. The work of [[Michael Halliday]] in the 1960s is responsible for developing linguistic science through his [[systemic functional linguistics]] model for English&lt;ref&gt;M.A.K.Halliday, An Introduction to Functional Grammar, 2nd ed.
London: Arnold, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==

The sentence- or clause-level "topic", or "theme", can be defined in a number of different ways. Among the most common are
*a) the phrase in a clause that the rest of the clause is understood to be about,
*b) a special position in a clause (often at the right or left-edge of the clause) where topics typically appear.

In an ordinary English clause, the subject is normally the same as the topic/theme (example 1), even in the passive voice (where the subject is a patient, not an agent: example 2):
*(1) ''The dog'' bit the little girl.
*(2) ''The little girl'' was bitten by the dog.

These clauses have different topics: the first is about ''the dog'', and the second about ''the little girl''.

In English it is also possible to use other sentence structures to show the topic of the sentence, as in the following:
*(3) ''As for the little girl'', the dog bit her.
*(4) ''It was the little girl'' that the dog bit.

The case of [[Syntactic expletive|expletives]] is sometimes rather complex. Consider sentences with expletives (meaningless subjects), like:

*(6) It is raining.
*(7) There is some room in this house.
*(8) There are two days in the year in which the day and the night are equal in length.

In these examples the syntactic subject position (to the left of the verb) is manned by the meaningless expletive ("it" or "there"), whose sole purpose is satisfying the [[extended projection principle]], and is nevertheless necessary. In these sentences the topic is never the subject, but is determined [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]]. In all these cases, the whole sentence refers to the comment part&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gotze, Stephanie Dipper, and Stavros Skopeteas. 2007. Information Structure in Cross-Linguistic Corpora: Annotation Guidelines for Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Information Structure. Interdisciplinary Studies on Information Structure (ISIS), Working papers of the SFB 632, Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The relation between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus should not be confused with the topic-comment relation in [[Rhetorical structure theory]] Discourse Treebank (RST-DT corpus) where it is defined as "a general statement or topic of discussion is introduced, after which a specific remark is made on the statement or topic" (ex. "[As far as the pound goes,] [some traders say a slide toward support at 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week.]") &lt;ref&gt;L. Carlson and D. Marcu, “Discourse tagging reference manual,” ISI Technical Report ISI-TR-545, vol. 54, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;L. Ermakova and J. Mothe. 2016. Document re-ranking based on topic-comment structure. In X IEEE International Conference RCIS, Grenoble, France, June 1-3, 2016. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Realization of topic–comment ==
Different languages mark topics in different ways. Distinct intonation and word-order are the most common means. The tendency to place topicalized constituents sentence-initially ("topic fronting") is widespread. Topic fronting refers to placing the topic at the beginning
of a clause regardless whether it is marked or not&lt;ref&gt;D. Bring, Topic and Comment. Cambridge University Press, 2011, three
entries for: Patrick Colm Hogan (ed.) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of
the Language Sciences. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Again, linguists disagree on many details. 

Languages often show different kinds of grammar for sentences that introduce new topics and those that continue discussing previously established topics. 

When a sentence continues discussing a previously established topic, it is likely to use pronouns to refer to the topic. Such topics tend to be subjects.  In many languages, pronouns referring to previously established topics will show [[pro-drop]].

=== In English ===
The topic/theme comes first in the clause, and is typically marked out by intonation as well.&lt;ref&gt;MAK Halliday (1994). ''An introduction to functional grammar'', 2nd ed., Hodder Arnold: London, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other languages===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
* [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]: the topic is normally marked with a [[postposition]] such as {{Nihongo||は|-wa}} or 는/은, ''-(n)eun''.
* In [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian French]], the topic is marked by the postposition « là ». The topic can be a noun or a nominal group but not necessarily : « Voiture-là est jolie deh » ; « Aujourd'hui-là il fait chaud » ; « Pour toi-là n'est pas comme pour moi hein » ; « Nous qui sommes ici-là, on attend ça seulement ».
* So-called free-word order languages (e.g. Russian, [[Czech language|Czech]], to a certain extent [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[German language|German]]) use word-order as the primary means. Usually the topic precedes focus. However, for example in Czech, both orders are possible. The order with comment sentence-initial is referred as ''subjective'' ([[Vilém Mathesius]] invented the term and opposed it to ''objective'') and expresses certain emotional involvement.  The two orders are distinguished by intonation.
* In [[Hebrew language|modern Hebrew]], a topic may follow its comment. In this case, the syntactic subject of the sentence is an expletive זה ("ze", lit. "this"). For example, זה מאד מענין הספר הזה "ze meod meanyen ha-sefer ha-ze" (lit. "This is very interesting this book") means "This book is very interesting".
* In [[American Sign Language#Topic and main clauses|American Sign Language]], a topic can be declared at the beginning of a sentence (indicated by raised eyebrows and head tilt) describing the object, then the rest of the sentence describes what happens to that object.

== Practical applications ==
The main application of the topic-comment structure is in the domain of speech technology, especially the design of embodied conversational agents (intonational focus assignment, relation between information structure and posture and gesture)&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Justine, ed. Embodied conversational agents. MIT press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;. There were some attempts to apply the theory of topic/comment for the information retrieval &lt;ref&gt;A. Bouchachia and R. Mittermeir, “A neural cascade architecture for
document retrieval,” in Neural Networks, 2003. Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on, vol. 3. IEEE, 2003, pp. 1915–1920.&lt;/ref&gt; and the automatic summarization &lt;ref&gt;L. Ermakova, J. Mothe, A. Firsov. A Metric for Sentence Ordering Assessment Based on Topic-Comment

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in computing''' have shaped the evolution of [[information technology]]. They were among the first programmers in the early-20th century, and contributed substantially to the industry. As technology and practices altered, the role of women as programmers has changed, and the recorded history of the field has downplayed their achievements.

Since the 18th century, women have developed scientific computations, including [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]]'s prediction of [[Halley's Comet]], and [[Maria Mitchell]]'s computation of the motion of [[Venus]]. The first [[algorithm]] intended to be executed by a computer was designed by [[Ada Lovelace]] who was a pioneer in the field. [[Grace Hopper]] was the first person to design a [[compiler]] for a [[programming language]]. Throughout the 19th and early-20th century, and up to [[World War II]], programming was predominantly done by women; significant examples include the [[Harvard Computers]], codebreaking at [[Bletchley Park]] and engineering at [[NASA]].

After the 1960s, the "soft work" that had been dominated by women evolved into modern [[software]], and the importance of women decreased. The gender disparity and the lack of women in computing from the late 20th century onward has been examined, but no firm explanations have been established. Nevertheless, many women continued to make significant and important contributions to the IT industry, and attempts were made to readdress the gender disparity in the industry. In the 21st century, women held leadership roles in multiple tech companies, such as [[Meg Whitman]], president and chief executive officer of [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]], and [[Marissa Mayer]], president and CEO of [[Yahoo!]] and key spokesperson at [[Google]].

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of women in computing}}

=== 1700s ===
[[Nicole-Reine Lepaute|Nicole-Reine Etable de la Brière Lepaute]] was one of a team of [[Human computer|human computers]] who worked with [[Alexis Clairaut|Alexis-Claude Clairaut]] and [[Jérôme Lalande|Joseph-Jérôme Le Français de Lalande]] to predict the date of the return of [[Halley's Comet]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=16}} They began work on the calculations in 1757, working throughout the day and sometimes during mealtimes.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=20-21}} Their methods were followed by successive human computers.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=25}} They divided large calculations into "independent pieces, assembled the results from each piece into a final product" and then checked for errors.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=25}} Lepaute continued to work on computing for the rest of her life, working for the [[Connaissance des Temps|''Connaissance de Temps'']] and publishing predictions of [[Solar eclipse|solar eclipses]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=24}}

=== 1800s ===
[[File:Astronomer_Edward_Charles_Pickering's_Harvard_computers.jpg|thumb|left|Astronomer Edward Charles Pickering's [[Harvard Computers|Harvard computers]]]]
One of the first computers for the American ''[[Nautical almanac|Nautical Almanac]]'' was [[Maria Mitchell|Maria Mitchel]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=61}} Her work on the assignment was to compute the motion of the planet [[Venus]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=62}} The ''Almanac'' never became a reality, but Mitchell became the first [[astronomy]] professor at [[Vassar College|Vassar]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=71}}

[[Ada Lovelace]] was the first person to publish an [[algorithm]] intended to be executed by the first modern computer, the [[Analytical Engine]] created by [[Charles Babbage]]. As a result she is often regarded as the first computer [[programmer]].&lt;ref name="Annals of the History of Computing"&gt;{{cite journal|first=J.|last=Fuegi|first2=J.|last2=Francis|title=Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'|journal=Annals of the History of Computing|volume=25|issue=4 |date=2003|pages=16–26|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips|first=Ana Lena|title=Crowdsourcing gender equity: Ada Lovelace Day, and its companion website, aims to raise the profile of women in science and technology|journal=American Scientist|date=November–December 2011|volume=99|issue=6|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelace Google"&gt;{{Cite news|date=December 10, 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/10/ada-lovelace-honoured-google-doodle|title=Ada Lovelace honoured by Google doodle|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelace was introduced to Babbage's [[difference engine]] when she was 17.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=16}} In 1840, she wrote to Babbage and asked if she could become involved with his first machine.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=17}} By this time, Babbage had moved on to his idea for the Analytical Engine.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=18}} A paper describing the Analytical Engine, ''Notions sur la machine analytique'', published by L.F. Menabrea, came to the attention of Lovelace, who not only translated it into English, but corrected mistakes made by Menabrea.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=19}} Babbage suggested that she expand the translation of the paper with her own ideas, which, signed only with her initials, AAL, "synthesized the vast scope of Babbage's vision."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=19-20}} Lovelace imagined the kind of impact of the Analytical Engine might have on society.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=20}} She drew up explanations of how the engine could handle inputs, outputs, processing and data storage.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} She also created several [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] to show how the engine would handle calculations of [[Bernoulli number|Bernoulli Numbers]] on its own.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} The proofs are considered the first examples of a computer program.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}}&lt;ref name="Annals of the History of Computing" /&gt; Lovelace downplayed her role in her work during her life, for example, in signing her contributions with AAL so as not be "accused of bragging."{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=5}}

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the United States, more women were hired as human computers.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=81}} Many were war widows looking for ways to support themselves.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=81}} Others were hired when the government opened positions to women because of a shortage of men to fill the roles.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=81}}

[[File:Annie Jump Cannon sitting at desk.jpg|thumb|[[Annie Jump Cannon]] working at Harvard]]
[[Anna Winlock]] asked to become a computer for the Harvard Observatory in 1875 and was hired to work for 25 cents an hour.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} By 1880, [[Edward Charles Pickering]] had hired several women to work for him at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] because he felt that women could do the job as well as men and he could ask them to volunteer or work for less pay.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=13}}{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} The women, described as "Pickering's harem" and also as the [[Harvard Computers]], performed clerical work that the male employees and scholars considered to be tedious at a fraction of the cost of hiring a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-female-computers-mapped-the-universe-and-brought-america-to-the-moon|title=How Female Computers Mapped the Universe and Brought America to the Moon|date=March 4, 2016|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=September 29, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women working for Pickering cataloged around ten thousand stars, discovered the [[Horsehead Nebula]] and developed the system to describe stars.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} One of the "computers," [[Annie Jump Cannon]], could classify stars at a rate of three stars per minute.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} The work for Pickering became so popular that women volunteered to work for free even when the computers were being paid.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=105}} Even though they performed an important role, the Harvard Computers were paid less than [[factory]] workers.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}}

By the 1890s, women computers were college graduates looking for jobs where they could use their training in a useful way.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=103}} Florence Tebb Weldon, was part of this group and provided computations relating to biology and evidence for [[evolution]], working with her husband, W.F. Raphael Weldon.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=106}} Florence Weldon's calculations demonstrated that statistics could be used to support [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of evolution.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=107}} Another human computer involved in biology was [[Alice Lee (mathematician)|Alice Lee]], who worked with [[Karl Pearson]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=110}} Pearson hired two sisters to work as part-time computers at his Biometrics Lab, [[Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave|Beatrice]] and [[Frances Cave-Browne-Cave|Frances Cave-Brown-Cave]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=112}}

=== 1910s ===
During [[World War I]], Karl Pearson and his Biometrics Lab helped produce [[ballistics]] calculations for the British [[Minister of Munitions|Ministry of Munitions]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}} Beatrice Cave-Brown-Cave helped calculate trajectories for bomb shells.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}} In 1916, Cave-Brown-Cave left Pearson's employ and started working full-time for the Ministry.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=131}} In the United States, women computers were hired to calculate ballistics in 1918, working in a building on the [[Washington Mall]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=138}} One of the women, Elizabeth Webb Wilson, worked as the chief computer.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=139}} After the war, women who worked as ballistics computers for the U.S. government had trouble finding jobs in computing and Wilson eventually taught high school math.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=152}}

=== 1920s ===
[[File:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14570000517).jpg|thumb|upright|A group of operators working on an [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] telephone switchboard]]
In the early 1920s, [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]], professor [[George W. Snedecor|George Snedecor]] worked to improve the school's science and engineering departments, experimenting with new punch-card machines and calculators.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=165-166}} Snedecor also worked with human calculators most of them women, including Mary Clem.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=167}} Clem coined the term "zero check" to help identify errors in calculations.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=167}} The computing lab, run by Clem, became one of the most powerful computing facilities of the time.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=167}}{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=169}} 

Women computers also worked at the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|American Telephone and Telegraph]] company.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170}} These human computers worked with [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] to help figure out how to boost signals with [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170}} One of the computers, Clara Froelich, was eventually moved along with the other computers to their own division where they worked with a mathematician, Thornton Fry, to create new computational methods.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170}} Froelich studied IBM [[Tabulating machine|tabulating equipment]] and desk calculating machines to see if she could adapt the machine method to calculations.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170-171}}

[[Edith Clarke]] was the first woman to earn a degree in [[electrical engineering]] and who worked as the first professionally employed electrical engineer in the United States.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ge.com/reports/edith-clarke-mother-of-invention/|title=Mother Of Invention: This Barrier-Busting Electrical Engineer Joined Edison, Tesla in National Inventors Hall of Fame – GE Reports|last=Kellner|first=Tomas|date=2017-02-10|work=GE Reports|access-date=2018-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825185215/https://www.ge.com/reports/edith-clarke-mother-of-invention/|archive-date=25 August 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was hired by [[General Electric]] as a full engineer in 1923.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Clarke also filed a patent in 1921 for a [[graphical calculator]] to be used in solving problems in power lines.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.women.cs.cmu.edu/ada/Resources/Women/|title=Pioneering Women in Computer Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ada Project|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326031002/https://www.women.cs.cmu.edu/ada/Resources/Women/|archive-date=26 March 2018|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was granted in 1925.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== 1930s ===
The [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) which became [[NASA]] hired a group of five women in 1935 to work as a computer pool.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/larc/from-computers-to-leaders-women-at-nasa-langley|title=From Computers to Leaders: Women at NASA Langley|last=Atkinson|first=Joe|date=August 24, 2015|work=NASA|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women worked on the data coming from [[wind tunnel]] and flight tests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1940s ===
[[File:'bombe'.jpg|alt=Woman working on a Bombe computing device.|thumb|left|Woman working on a [[Bombe]] computing device.]]
"Tedious" computing and calculating was seen as "women's work" through the 1940s{{Sfn|Mundy|2017|p=21}} resulting in the term "kilogirl", invented by a member of the [[Applied Mathematics Panel]] in the early 1940s.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=24}} A kilogirl of energy was "equivalent to roughly a thousand hours of computing labor."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=24}} While women's contributions to the United States war effort during [[World War II]] was championed in the media, their roles and the work they did was minimized.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=455-456}} This included minimizing the complexity, skill and knowledge needed to work on computers or work as human computers.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=455-456}} During WWII, women did most of the ballistics computing, seen by male engineers as being below their level of expertise.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=460}}  [[Black women]] computers worked as hard (or more often, twice as hard) as their white counterparts, but in segregated situations.{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=47-48}} By 1943, almost all people employed as computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}}

NACA expanded its a pool of women human computers in the 1940s.{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} NACA recognized in 1942 that "the engineers admit themselves that the girl computers do the work more rapidly and accurately than they could."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1943 two groups, segregated by race, worked on the east and west side of [[Langley Air Force Base]].{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} The black women were the [[West Area Computers]].{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} Unlike their white counterparts, the black women were asked by NACA to re-do college courses they had already passed and many never received promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a24429/hidden-figures-real-story-nasa-women-computers/|title=The True Story of 'Hidden Figures' and the Women Who Crunched the Numbers for NASA|last=Blitz|first=Matt|date=February 3, 2017|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=October 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were also working on ballistic missile calculations. In 1948, women such as [[Barbara Paulson]] were working on the [[WAC Corporal]], determining trajectories the missiles would take after launch.{{Sfn|Holt|2016|p=58-59}}

Women worked with [[cryptography]] and, after some initial resistance, many operated and worked on the [[Bombe]] machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/women-were-key-code-breaking-bletchley-park-180954044/|title=Women Were Key to WWII Code-Breaking at Bletchley Park|last=Fessenden|first=Marissa|work=Smithsonian|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Aylard]] operated the Bombe machine testing different methods to break the [[Enigma machine|Enigma code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/jul/24/meet-the-female-codebreakers-of-bletchley-park|title=Meet the female codebreakers of Bletchley Park|last=Bearne|first=Suzanne|date=July 24, 2018|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Clarke]] was a cryptographer who worked with her friend, [[Alan Turing]], on the Enigma machine at [[Bletchley Park]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29840653|title=The woman who cracked Enigma cyphers|last=Miller|first=Joe|date=November 10, 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was promoted to a higher salary grade, there were no positions in the civil service for a "senior female cryptanalyst," and she was listed as a linguist instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/members/achievements/women-code-breakers-forgotten-by-history|title=Women Code Breakers: Forgotten by History|last=Pretz|first=Kathy|date=February 5, 2015|website=The Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Clarke developed a method of increasing the speed of double-encrypted messages, unlike many of the men, her decryption technique was not named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/joan-clarke-one-of-the-forgotten-women-of-bletchley|title=Joan Clarke, one of the forgotten women of Bletchley|last=Condie|first=Bill|date=May 14, 2015|website=Cosmos|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cryptographers at Bletchley included [[Margaret Rock]], [[Mavis Batey|Mavis Lever]] (later Batey), Ruth Briggs and Kerry Howard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1941, Batey's work enabled the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to break the Italian's naval code before the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-12-23/alan-turing-may-have-cracked-nazi-codes-thousands-women-helped|title=Alan Turing may have cracked Nazi codes, but thousands of women helped|last=Porzucki|first=Nina|date=December 23, 2014|work=Public Radio International|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, several faster Bombe machines were created.{{Sfn|Mundy|2017|p=270-271}} Women, like Louise Pearsall, were recruited from the [[WAVES]] to work on code breaking and operate the American Bombe machines.{{Sfn|Mundy|2017|p=271-272}}

[[Hedy Lamarr]] and co-inventor, [[George Antheil|George Anthei]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l, worked on a [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum|frequency hopping]] method to help the Navy control torpedoes remotely.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Navy passed on their idea, but Lamarr and Antheil received a patent for the work on August 11, 1942.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This technique would later be used again, first in the 1950s at Sylvania Electronic Systems Division and is used in everyday technology such as [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The programmers of the [[ENIAC]] computer in 1944, were six female mathematicians; [[Marlyn Meltzer]], [[Betty Holberton]], [[Kathleen Antonelli]], [[Ruth Teitelbaum]], [[Jean Bartik]], and [[Frances Spence]] who were human computers at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering|Moore School's]] computation lab.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=39}} [[Adele Goldstine]] was their teacher and trainer and they were known as the "ENIAC girls."{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=459}} The women who worked on ENIAC were warned that they would not be promoted into professional ratings which were only for men.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} Designing the hardware was "men's work" and programming the software was "women's work."{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=469}}  Sometimes women were given [[blueprint]]s and [[wiring diagram]]s to figure out how the machine worked and how to program it.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=470}} They learned how the ENIAC worked by repairing it, sometimes crawling through the computer, and by fixing "bugs" in the machinery.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=470}} Even though the programmers were supposed to be doing the "soft" work of programming, in reality, they did that and fully understood and worked with the hardware of the ENIAC.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=471}} When the ENIAC was revealed in 1946, Goldstine and the other women prepared the machine and the demonstration programs it ran for the public.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=472}} None of their work in preparing the demonstrations was mentioned in the official accounts of the public events.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=473}} After the demonstration, the university hosted an expensive celebratory dinner to which none of the ENIAC six were invited.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=51}}

In Canada, [[Beatrice Worsley]] started working at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council of Canada]] in 1947 where she was an aerodynamics research officer.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/beatrice-worsley|title=Beatrice Worsley|last=Raymond|first=Katrine|date=25 October 2017|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113171457/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/beatrice-worsley/|archive-date=13 January 2018|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, she started working in the new Computational Centre at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; She built a [[Differential analyser|differential analyzer]] in 1948 and also worked with IBM machines in order to do calculations for [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; She went to study the [[EDSAC]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; She wrote the program that was run the first time EDSAC performed its first calculations on May 6, 1949.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/5484/EDSAC-performed-its-first-calculations/|title=EDSAC performed its first calculations|last=|first=|date=|website=Computing History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Grace Hopper]] was the first person to create a [[compiler]] for a [[programming language]] and one of the first programmers of the [[Harvard Mark I]] computer, an electro-mechanical computer based on Analytical Engine. Hopper's work with computers started in 1943, when she started working at the [[Bureau of Ordnance]]'s Computation Project at Harvard where she programmed the Harvard Mark I.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} Hopper not only programmed the computer, but created a 500 page comprehensive manual for it.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Even though Hopper created the manual which was widely cited and published, she was not specifically credited in the manual.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Hopper is often credited with the coining of the term "bug" and "[[debugging]]" when a moth caused the Mark II to malfunction.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=176}} While a moth was found and the process of removing it called "debugging," the terms were already part of the language of programmers.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=176}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2515435/app-development/moth-in-the-machine--debugging-the-origins-of--bug-.html|title=Moth in the machine: Debugging the origins of 'bug'|last=|first=|date=September 3, 2011|work=Computerworld|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/12/googles-doodle-honors-grace-hopper-and-entomology/|title=Google Honors Grace Hopper...and a "bug"|last=Pearson|first=Gwen|date=December 9, 2013|work=WIRED|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adele Mildred Koss, who had worked at UNIVAC with Hopper, started work at [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC) in 1965.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} There she developed algorithms for graphics, including graphic storage and retrieval.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}}

[[Mary K. Hawes]] of [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroghs Corporation]] set up a meeting in 1959 to discuss the creation a computer language that would be shared between businesses.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} Six people, including Hopper, attended to discuss the philosophy of creating a common business language (CBL).{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} Hopper became involved in developing [[COBOL]] (Common Business Oriented Language) where she innovated new symbolic ways to write computer code.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Hopper developed programming language that was easier to read and "self-documenting."{{Sfn|Ceruzzi|1998|p=92}} After COBOL was submitted to the [[CODASYL]] Executive Committee, Betty Holberton did further editing on the language before it was submitted to the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] in 1960.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} IBM were slow to adopt COBOL, which hindered its progress but it was accepted as a standard in 1962, after Hopper had demonstrated the compiler working both on UNIVAC and RCA computers.{{sfn|Marx|2004|p=60}} The development of COBOL led to the generation of compilers and generators, most of which were created or refined by women such as Koss, Nora Moser, Deborah Davidson, Sue Knapp, Gertrude Tierney and [[Jean E. Sammet]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=73}}

Sammet, who worked at IBM starting in 1961 was responsible for developing the programming language, [[FORMAC]].{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} She  published a book, ''Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals'' (1969), which was considered the "standard work on programming languages," according to Denise Gürer {{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} It was "one of the most used books in the field," according to ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Times]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24510360/|title=Computer Authority to Speak Here|last=|first=|date=April 9, 1972|work=The Times|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] announced a "White-Hot" revolution in technology, that would give greater prominence to IT work. As women still held most computing and programming positions at this time, it was hoped that it would give them more positive career prospects.{{sfn|Hicks|2017|p=14}} In 1965, [[Mary Kenneth Keller|Sister Mary Kenneth Keller]] became the first American woman to earn a doctorate in computer science.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=180}} Keller helped develop [[BASIC]] while working as a graduate student at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], where the university "broke the 'men only' rule" so she could use its computer science center.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=180-181}}

[[Christine Darden]] began working for NASA's computing pool in 1967 having graduated from the [[Hampton Institute]].{{sfn|Edwards|Harris|2016|p=50}} Women were involved in the development of [[Whirlwind I|Whirlwind]], including [[Judy Clapp]].{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} She created the prototype for an air defense system for Whirlwind which used radar input to track planes in the air and could direct aircraft courses.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}}

In 1969, [[Elizabeth J. Feinler|Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler]], who was working for [[Stanford University|Stanford]], made the first Resource Handbook for [[ARPANET]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=112}} This led to the creation of the ARPANET directory, which was built by Feinler with a staff of mostly women.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=113}} Without the directory, "it was nearly impossible to navigate the ARPANET."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=116}} 

By the end of the decade, the general demographics of programmers had shifted away from being predominantly women, as they had before the 1940s.{{sfn|Hicks|2017|p=1}} Though women accounted for around 30 to 50 percent of computer programmers during the 1960s, few were promoted to leadership roles and women were paid significantly less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76-77}} ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' ran an article in the April 1967 issue about women in programming called "The Computer Girls."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=75}} Even while magazines such as ''Cosmopolitan'' saw a bright future for women in computers and computer programming in the 1960s, the reality was that women were still being marginalized.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76}}

In the early 1970s, Pam Hardt-English led a group to create a computer network they named Resource One and which was part of a group called [[Project One (San Francisco)|Project One]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=100}} Her idea to connect Bay Area bookstores, libraries and Project One was an early prototype of the [[Internet]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76}} To work on the project, Hardt-English obtained an expensive [[SDS 940|SDS-940]] computer as a donation from TransAmerica Leasing Corporation in April 1972.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=98}} They created an electronic library and housed it in a record store called Leopold's in Berkeley.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=101}} This became the Community Memory database and was maintained by hacker, [[Jude Milhon]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=102}} After 1975, the SDS-940 computer was repurposed by Sherry Reson, Mya Shone, Chris Macie and Mary Janowitz to create a social services database and a Social Services Referral Directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=104-105}} Hard copies of the directory, printed out as a subscription service, were kept at city buildings and libraries.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=106-107}} The database was maintained and in use until 2009.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=107}}

In the early 1970s, Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler, who worked on the Resource Directory for ARPANET, and her team created the first [[WHOIS]] directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=119}} Feinler set up a server at the [[Domain name registry|Network Information Center]] (NIC) at Stanford which would work as a directory that could retrieve relevant information about a person or entity.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=119}} She and her team worked on the creation of [[Domain name|domains]], with Feinler suggesting that domains be divided by categories based on where the computers were kept.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=120}} For example, military computers would have the domain of .mil, computers at educational institutions would have .edu.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=120-121}} Feinler worked for NIC until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/elizabeth-jake-feinler/|title=Before Google and GoDaddy, There Was Elizabeth Feinler|last=Metz|first=Cade|date=June 18, 2012|work=WIRED|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, several attempts have been made to reduce the gender disparity in IT and get more women involved in computing again. A 2001 survey found that while both sexes use computers and the internet in equal measure, women were still five times less likely to choose it as a career or study the subject beyond standard secondary education.{{sfn|Frieze|Quesenberry|2015|p=15}} Journalist [[Emily Chang (journalist)|Emily Chang]] said a key problem has been [[personality test]]s in job interviews and the belief that good programmers are introverts, which tends to self-select the stereotype of an antisocial white male nerd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-emily-chang-brotopia-interview|title=Why sexism is rife in Silicon Valley|first=Emily|last=Chang|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 17, 2018|accessdate=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6367">'''Zhuang studies''' (or Zhuangology; [[Standard Zhuang]]: Cuenghhag; {{zh|t=壯學|s=壮学|p=Zhuàngxué}})  is an [[interdisciplinary]] intellectual field concerned with the [[Zhuang people]]&amp;nbsp;– their history, anthropology, religion, politics, [[Zhuang languages|languages]], and literature. The majority of such research is being carried out in the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Huang Xianfan]] (黄现璠) is considered by many to be the father of Zhuang studies.&lt;ref&gt;Mo jun:《A Master of Zhuang Studies》.Guangxi's daily, on 3 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Areas commonly included under this rubric include [[history]] of Zhuang, [[literature]] of Zhuang, [[art]] of Zhuang, [[music]] of Zhuang, [[language]] of Zhuang, [[sociology]] of Zhuang, political science of Zhuang, [[economics]] of Zhuang, [[folklore]] of Zhuang, and ethnomusicology of Zhuang. It may be compared to other ethnic groups studies disciplines, such as Tai studies and Yao studies. Zhuang studies is sometimes included within a broader regional area of focus including: "[[Lingnan]] studies", "[[Baiyue|Yue people]] studies","[[South Asia]] studies", or "[[ASEAN]] Studies".

==History==
Zhuang studies is a relatively new discipline.

Huang Xianfan may be considered as the first Zhuangologist and he did much to make Zhuang known in China. Since 1950, Huang Xianfan led the group making a largest and deepest investigation on ethnic history and traditional [[culture]] in [[Guangxi]] history. They had collected a lot of valuable materials and laid a foundation for further research on Zhuang ethnic social and historical culture.That was a very important beginning for later development of Zhuang ethnic research and establishment of Guangxi institute of ethnic studies. Therefore, the inception of Zhuang studies as an authentic academic discipline is thus associated with the  first  ethnologist Huang Xianfan de Zhuang who is considered as its founder to present day,&lt;ref&gt;Mo jun:《A Master of Zhuang Studies》.Guangxi's daily, on 3 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the other early zhuang studies of note being Huang Zengqing ([[Huang group]]'s member and the first archaeological researcher of the Guangxi) who in 1957 occupied the first chair for Zhuang's  [[archaeology]] studies in China and Zhou Zuoqiou, who was primarily the pioneering subject of the zhuang literature in [[Guangxi Normal University]].

The [[Huang group|Bagui School]] (The first ethnic school in [[China]] and pioneer is [[Huang Xianfan]]) was particularly significant for the development of the discipline since the early 1950s with Huang Xianfan, Huang Zengqing, Ban Xiouwen, Ou Yang Ruoxiou, Qin Cailuan, Qin Naichang, Qin Shengmin, He Longqun, Yu Shijie, Qin Deqing, Pan Qixu, Huang Hanjin and Zeng Chaoxiong.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-HSKX200808010.htm Chen Ji Sheng:《On Bagui School of Chinese Ethnology》, Guangxi Social Sciences，7th–11th Issues，2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc88.com/p-405985601120.html  Chen Ji Sheng:《On Bagui School of Chinese Ethnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the Guangxi government established the Guangxi institute of ethnic studies to promote Zhuang studies around China. In 1991 the Guangxi Zhuang Studies Society was established, and in April 1999 the first international Zhuang studies conference was held in Wuming with scholars from 8 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-MZYJ903.012.htm 郭爱民  :《壮学首届国际学术研讨会综述》, 《民族研究》 1999年03期]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last few decades in other countries the studies of the Zhuang have opened towards other disciplines, resulting in works with interdisciplinary approach. As examples of such open-minded Zhuang researcher we might mention the [[United States|American]] anthropologist Jeffrey Barlow, among others, who has done noted research and publications on lexical questions, about Zhuang culture  and the modern history of Zhuang. Others are [[Japanese people|Japanese]] anthropologist Chikada Sigeyuki, [[Australian]] anthropologist David Holm, and many more.

Note: This book is written in English by Professor Jin Li of [[Guangxi University for Nationalities]]. It is addressed to two groups of readers for two different purposes. First, it is hoped that Chinese students whose majors are related to Zhuang studies would by reading this book be exposed to academic writing in English on relevant subjects. Second, it may be beneficial to English-speaking people who have an interest in the Zhuang, their history and their culture.
