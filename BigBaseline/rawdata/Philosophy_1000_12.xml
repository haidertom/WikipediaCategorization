'''16th-century philosophy''' is generally regarded as the later part of [[Renaissance philosophy]].

Early 16th-century philosophy is often called the '''High Renaissance''' and is considered to succeed the [[Renaissance philosophy]] era and precede the [[Age of Rationalism]].  Notable philosophers from the time period include [[Desiderius Erasmus]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and [[Michel de Montaigne]].&lt;ref&gt;''Early Modern Philosophy: Essential Readings with Commentary'', edited by [[Aloysius Martinich|A.

{{Love sidebar|types}}
'''''Amour de soi''''' (French, "self-love") is a concept in the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that refers to the kind of [[self-love]] that humans share with brute animals and predates the appearance of society. Acts committed out of ''amour de soi'' tend to be for individual well-being. They are naturally good and not malicious because ''amour de soi'' as self-love does not involve pursuing one's self-interest at the expense of others. The sentiment does not compare oneself with others, but is concerned solely with regarding oneself as an absolute and valuable existence. It is related to an awareness of one's future and can restrain present impulse. Rousseau contrasts it with ''[[amour-propre]]'', that kind of self-love, found in [[Thomas Hobbes]]' philosophy, in which one's opinion of oneself is dependent on what other people think and which arises only with society.

Rousseau suggested that ''amour de soi'' was lost during the transition from the pre-societal condition to society, but it can be restored by the use of "good" institutions created with the [[social contract]]. This renewed passage from the [[state of nature]] to the civilized state, would bring man to favor [[justice]] instead of [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Derathé, ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau et la science politique de son temps'', Paris, Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1995, pp. 135-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy, '''animalism''' is a theory according to which humans are animals.&lt;ref&gt;Eric T. Olson (2007) ''What are we?: a study in personal ontology'', Oxford University Press, section 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of animalism is advocated by philosophers [[Eric T. Olson (philosopher)|Eric T. Olson]], Paul Snowdon, Stephan Blatti, and [[David Wiggins]].&lt;ref name=garrett&gt; Brian Garrett, ''Personal Identity and Self-Consciousness''. Routledge, 1998. 137 pages. {{ISBN|0-415-16573-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blatti, Stephan and Snowdon, Paul (eds.)

The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ἄπορον}}'', which signifies something very difficult and impracticable, being formed from the privative ''α'', and ''{{lang|grc|πόρος}}'', "passage". When a question was proposed to any of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers, especially of the sect of [[Academists]], if he could not give a solution, his answer was ''{{lang|grc|ἀποροῶ}}'', q.d.

The '''argument from free will''', also called the '''paradox of free will''' or '''[[Theological determinism|theological fatalism]]''', contends that [[omniscience]] and [[free will]] are [[Incompatible-properties argument|incompatible]] and that any conception of [[God]] that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently [[Contradiction|contradictory]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the various [[Omniscience#Controversies|controversies]] over claims of God's omniscience, in particular the critical notion of [[predestination|foreknowledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/ Foreknowledge and Free Will]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow|title=Foreknowledge and Free Will|last=Swartz|first=Norman|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

==Omniscience and free will==
[[File:Chess-king.JPG|thumb|right|150px|If God made the game, its rules, and the players, then how can any player be free?]]
Some arguments against the [[existence of God]] focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing [[free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

[[Moses Maimonides]] formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:

{{quote|… "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that the man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand how he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A logical formulation of this argument might go as follows:&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;
# God knows choice "C" that a human would claim to "make freely".
# It is now necessary that C.
# If it is now necessary that C, then C cannot be otherwise (this is the definition of “necessary”). That is, there are no actual "possibilities" due to predestination.
# If you cannot do otherwise when you act, you do not act freely (Principle of Alternate Possibilities)
# Therefore, when you do an act, you will not do it freely.

[[Norman Swartz]], however, contends that the above arguments commit the [[modal fallacy]]. In particular, he asserts that these arguments assume that if C is true, it becomes necessary for C to be true, which is incorrect as C is contingent (see [[Modal logic | modal logic]]). Otherwise, one can argue that the future is set already regardless of his actions.&lt;ref name=iep /&gt;

Other means of reconciling God's omniscience with human free will have been proposed. Some have attempted to redefine or reconceptualize free will:
* God can know in advance what I will do, because free will is to be understood only as freedom from [[coercion]], and anything further is an illusion. This is the move made by [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic]] philosophies.
* The sovereignty (autonomy) of God, existing within a free agent, provides strong inner compulsions toward a course of action (calling), and the power of choice (election). The actions of a human are thus determined by a human acting on relatively strong or weak urges (both from God and the environment around them) and their own relative power to choose.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosopher's Handbook'', Stanley Rosen, ed., Random House Reference, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposition first offered by [[Boethius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Consolatio Philosophiae'', Boethius, book 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also ''[[Divine Providence]]'' versus the concept of [[Destiny|Fate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C. S. Lewis]], suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', Lewis argues that God is actually outside time and therefore does not "foresee" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:
{{quote|But suppose God is outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call "tomorrow" is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call "today". All the days are "Now" for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday, He simply sees you doing them: because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not. He does not "foresee" you doing things tomorrow, He simply sees you doing them: because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you, it is for Him. You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same way—because He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done it is already "Now" for Him.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 p.149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common objection is to argue that [[Molinism]], or the belief that God can know counterfactually the actions of his creations, is true. This has been used as an argument by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Lane Craig]], amongst others.

==Freewill argument for the nonexistence of God==
[[Dan Barker]] suggests that this can lead to a "Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God"&lt;ref&gt;''The Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God'' by Dan Barker, [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] [https://ffrf.org/legacy/about/bybarker/fang.php]&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that God's omniscience is incompatible with God having free will and that if God does not have freewill God is not a [[personal God|personal being]].

Theists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is [[omniscience|omniscient]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[Richard Swinburne]] ''Does God Exist?'' of ''The Catechism of the Catholic Church''&lt;/ref&gt; but there is some disagreement about whether "omniscient" means:
# "knows everything that God chooses to know and that is logically possible to know"; Or instead the slightly stronger:
# "knows everything that is logically possible to know"&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These two terms are known as ''inherent'' and ''total'' omniscience, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7822">'''Assemblage''' (from {{lang-fr|agencement}}, "a collection of things which have been gathered together or assembled") is an ontological framework developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], originally presented in their book ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980). Assemblage theory provides a bottom-up framework for analyzing social complexity by emphasizing fluidity, exchangeability, and multiple functionalities through entities and their connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UT2016&gt;Wikis.la.utexas.edu,. (2016). Assemblage Theory | University of Texas Theory. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from {{cite web|url=http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314011817/http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |archivedate=2016-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblage theory asserts that, within a body, the relationships of component parts are not stable and fixed; rather, they can be displaced and replaced within and among other bodies, thus approaching systems through relations of exteriority.&lt;ref name=UT2016 /&gt;

==Overview==
The term assemblage, in a philosophical sense, originally stems from the French word ''agencement'', whose meaning translates narrowly to English as "arrangement", "fitting, or "fixing".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J.|title=Agencement/Assemblage|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026327640602300219|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=23|issue=2-3|pages=108–109|doi=10.1177/026327640602300219}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Agencement'' asserts the inherent implication of the connection between specific concepts and that the arrangement of those concepts is what provides sense or meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, I., 2015. Assemblage theory and its discontents. Deleuze Studies, 9(3), pp.382-392.&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblage, on the other hand, can be more accurately described as the integration and connection of these concepts and that it is both the connections ''and'' the arrangements of those connections that provide context for assigned meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, I., 2015. Assemblage theory and its discontents. Deleuze Studies, 9(3), pp.382-392.&lt;/ref&gt; 

John Phillips argued in 2006 that Deleuze and Guattari rarely used the term assemblage at all in a philosophical sense, and that through narrow, literal English translations, the terms became misleadingly perceived as analogous. The translation of ''agencement'' as assemblage that "give[s] rise to the connotations based on analogical impressions, which liberate elements of a vocabulary from the arguments that once helped form it." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Deleuze and Guattari&lt;!--linked from 'Gilles Deleuze' and 'Template:Deleuze-Guattari'--&gt; ==
In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', Deleuze and Guattari draw from [[dynamical systems theory]], which explores the way material systems self-organize, and extend the theory to include social, linguistic, and philosophical systems in order to create assemblage theory.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008"&gt;Smith, D., &amp; Protevi, J. (2008). Gilles Deleuze. plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/#ThoPla&lt;/ref&gt; In assemblage theory, assemblages (or relationships) are formed through the processes of coding, stratification, and territorialization&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;. Any one philosophical context never operates in isolation. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deleuze and Guattari use the term "constellation" when they talk about assemblage.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A constellation, like any assemblage, is made up of imaginative contingent articulations among myriad heterogeneous elements.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise"&gt;Wise, J., &amp; Slack, J. (2014). Culture and Technology. New York, NY: Lang, Peter New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of ordering matter around a body is called coding.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; According to Deleuze and Guattari, assemblages are coded by taking a particular form; they select, compose, and complete a territory.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; In composing a territory, there exists the creation of hierarchical bodies in the process of stratification.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; Drawing from the constellation metaphor, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the constellation includes some heavenly bodies but leaves out others; the included bodies being those in close proximity given the particular gathering and angle of view.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; The example constellation thus defines the relationships with the bodies in and around it, and therefore demonstrates the social complexity of assemblage.

Territorialization is another process of assemblage theory, and is viewed as the ordering of the bodies that create the "assemblage".&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; Assemblages territorialize both forms of content and forms of expression. Forms of content, also known as material forms, include the assemblage of human and nonhuman bodies, actions, and reactions. Forms of expression include incorporeal enunciations, acts, and statements.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; Within this ordering of the bodies, assemblages do not remain static; they are further characterized by processes of [[deterritorialization]] and reterritorialization. Deterritorialization occurs when articulations are disarticulated and disconnected through components "exiting" the assemblage; once again exemplfying the idea that these forms do not and can not operate alone&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; Reterritorialization describes the process by which new components "enter" and new articulations are forged, thus constituting a new assemblage.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; In this way, these axes of content/expressive and the processes of territorialization exist to demonstrate the complex nature of  assemblages.

== DeLanda ==
[[Manuel DeLanda]] detailed the concept of assemblage in his book ''[[A New Philosophy of Society]]'' (2006) where, like Deleuze and Guattari, he suggests that social bodies on all scales are best analyzed through their individual components. Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda’s approach examines relations of exteriority, in which assemblage components are self-subsistent and retain autonomy outside of the assemblage in which they exist &lt;ref name="Karaman2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karaman | first1 = O | year = 2008 | title = A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory And Social Complexity by Manuel DeLanda | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2008.00646.x | journal = Antipode | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 935–937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLanda details Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) assemblage theory of how assemblage components are organized through the two axes of material/expressive and territorializing/deterritorializing.&lt;ref name="Karaman2008" /&gt; DeLanda's additional contribution is to suggest that a third axis exists: of genetic/linguistic resources that also defines the interventions involved in the coding, decoding, and recoding of the assemblage.&lt;ref name="Karaman2008" /&gt; Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda suggests that the social does not lose its reality, nor its materiality, through its complexity.&lt;ref name="UT2016" /&gt; In this way, assemblages are effective in their practicality; assemblages, though fluid, are nevertheless part of historically significant processes.

'''''At the Existentialist Cafe: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails''''' is a 2016 book written by [[Sarah Bakewell]] that covers the philosophy and history of the 20th century movement [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakewell|first1=Sarah|title=At the Existentialist Cafe: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails|date=2016|publisher=Other Books|location=New York, New York|edition=1st|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary==
Bakewell structures ''At the Existentialist Cafe'' by focusing each chapter on a particular philosopher or time period within the existentialist movement first starting by introducing the early existentialists [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Dostoevsky]], and [[Kafka]] and then moving onto the lives and philosophies of [[Heidegger]], [[Husserl]], [[Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir|Beauvoir]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Merleau-Ponty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6803">In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], '''Benacerraf's identification problem''' is a [[philosophical argument]], developed by [[Paul Benacerraf]], against [[set-theoretic Platonism]].&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be"&gt;Paul Benacerraf (1965), “What Numbers Could Not Be”, ''Philosophical Review'' Vol. 74, pp. 47–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, Benacerraf published a [[Paradigm shift|paradigm changing]] article entitled "What Numbers Could Not Be".&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hale and Crispin Wright (2002) [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.693.9943&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Benacerraf's Dilemma Revisited"] ''European Journal of Philosophy'', '''10'''(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, the work became a significant catalyst in motivating the development of [[Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|mathematical structuralism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Shapiro (1997) ''Philosophy of Mathematics: Structure and Ontology'' New York: Oxford University Press, p. 37. {{ISBN|0195139305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification problem argues that there exists a fundamental problem in [[Reductionism|reducing]] [[natural numbers]] to [[pure sets]].  Since there exists an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of ways of identifying the natural numbers with pure sets, no particular set-theoretic method can be determined as the "true" reduction.  Benacerraf infers that any attempt to make such a choice of reduction immediately results in generating a meta-level, set-theoretic falsehood, namely in relation to other [[Elementarily equivalent|elementarily-equivalent]] set-theories not [[Law of identity|identical]] to the one chosen.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  The identification problem argues that this creates a fundamental problem for Platonism, which maintains that mathematical objects have a real, abstract existence.  '''Benacerraf's dilemma'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; to Platonic set-theory is arguing that the Platonic attempt to identify the "true" reduction of natural numbers to pure sets, as revealing the [[intrinsic properties]] of these abstract mathematical objects, is impossible.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  As a result, the identification problem ultimately argues that the relation of set theory to natural numbers cannot have an [[Ontology|ontologically]] Platonic nature.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;

== Historical motivations ==

The historical motivation for the development of Benacerraf's identification problem derives from a fundamental problem of ontology.  Since [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval]] times, philosophers have argued as to whether the ontology of mathematics contains [[abstract objects]].  In the philosophy of mathematics, an abstract object is traditionally defined as an entity that: (1) exists independent of the mind; (2) exists independent of the empirical world; and (3) has eternal, unchangeable properties.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loux (2006) ''Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction'' (Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy), London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0415401348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional mathematical Platonism maintains that some set of mathematical elements–[[natural numbers]], [[real numbers]], [[Functions (mathematics)|functions]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[systems]]–are such abstract objects.  Contrarily, mathematical [[nominalism]] denies the existence of any such abstract objects in the ontology of mathematics.  
   
In the late 19th and early 20th century, a number of anti-Platonist programs gained in popularity.  These included [[intuitionism]], [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], and [[predicativism]].  By the mid-20th century, however, these anti-Platonist theories had a number of their own issues.  This subsequently resulted in a resurgence of interest in Platonism.  It was in this historic context that the motivations for the identification problem developed.

== Description ==

The identification problem begins by evidencing some set of elementarily-equivalent, set-theoretic models of the natural numbers.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  Benacerraf considers two such set-theoretic methods:

::'''Set-theoretic method I''' (using [[Zermelo ordinals]])
::0 = ∅
::1 = {{mset|∅}}
::2 = {{mset|{{mset|∅}}}}
::3 = {{mset|{{mset|{{mset|∅}}}}}}
::...

::'''Set-theoretic method II''' (using [[von Neumann ordinals]])
::0 = ∅
::1 = {{mset|∅}}
::2 = {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}}}
::3 = {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}, {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}}}}}
::...

As Benacerraf demonstrates, both method I and II reduce natural numbers to sets.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  Benacerraf formulates the dilemma as a question: which of these set-theoretic methods uniquely provides the true identity statements, which elucidates the true ontological nature of the natural numbers?&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  Either method I or II could be used to define the natural numbers and subsequently generate true arithmetical statements to form a mathematical system.  In their relation, the elements of such mathematical systems are [[isomorphic]] in their structure.  However, the problem arises when these isomorphic structures are related together on the meta-level.  The definitions and arithmetical statements from system I are not identical to the definitions and arithmetical statements from system II.  For example, the two systems differ in their answer to whether 0 ∈ 2, insofar as ∅ is not an element of {{mset|{{mset|∅}}}}.  Thus, in terms of failing the [[transitivity of identity]], the search for true identity statements similarly fails.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt; By attempting to reduce the natural numbers to sets, this renders a set-theoretic falsehood between the isomorphic structures of different mathematical systems.  This is the essence of the identification problem.

According to Benacerraf, the philosophical ramifications of this identification problem result in Platonic approaches failing the ontological test.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  The argument is used to demonstrate the impossibility for Platonism to reduce numbers to sets that reveals the existence of abstract objects.

'''Bradley's Regress''' is a philosophical problem concerning the nature of [[Relation (philosophy)|relations]].  It is named after [[F. H. Bradley]] who discussed the problem in his 1893 book ''Appearance and Reality''.  It bears a close kinship to the issue of the [[unity of the proposition]].

== Description==

Bradley raises the problem while discussing the [[bundle theory]] of objects, according to which an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is merely a "bundle" of [[property|properties]].  This theory raises the question of how the various properties that together comprise an object are related when they in fact comprise an object.  More generally, the question that arises is what has to be the case for any two things to be related. Bradley's Regress appears to show that the notion of two things being related generates an [[infinite regress]].  

Suppose, for example, that ''a'' respects ''b''.  This [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] seems to involve three things: ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting.  For the state of affairs of ''a'' respecting ''b'' to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting) exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might say, is that ''a'' and ''b'' "stand in" the relation of respecting.  But now we seem to have another state of affairs: the state of affairs of ''a'' and ''b'' standing in the relation of respecting.  This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: ''a'', ''b'', the relation of respecting, and the relation of standing in.  Again, however, for it to be the case that ''a'' and ''b'' stand in the relation of respecting, it doesn't suffice that these four items exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might now say, is that ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, [[ad infinitum]].

== Responses ==

In ''Appearance and Reality'', Bradley seems to conclude that the regress should lead us to abandon the idea that relations are "independently real".  One way to take this suggestion is as recommending that in the case of a respecting b, we are dealing with a state of affairs that has only two constituents: a and b.  It does not, in addition, involve a third item, "the relation of respecting", to which a and b must then bear some further relation ("standing in").

A different option is to accept that the regress is real, but to deny that it is a [[infinite regress|vicious regress]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2533">The concept of '''canon''' is very broad; in a general sense it refers to being a rule or a body of rules.

In philosophy, the '''Cartesian Other''', part of a thought experiment, is any other than the mind of the individual thinking about the experiment. The Other includes the individual's own body. According to the philosopher [[Descartes]], there is a divide intrinsic to consciousness, such that you cannot ever bridge the space between your own consciousness and that of another.

This "other" is in essence theoretical, since one cannot ever be [[empirical]]ly shown such an "other."

Put differently, Descartes concluded ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'', "I think, therefore I am," that is, that the presence of a self of which to speak (an "I") proves its existence to oneself; however, according to his [[Descartes#Philosophical work|Wax Argument]], one could never similarly demonstrate the existence of the "other."

'''Cartesian anxiety''' refers to the notion that, since [[René Descartes]] posited his influential form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-mind dualism]], Western [[civilization]] has suffered from a longing for [[ontology|ontological]] certainty, or feeling that [[scientific method]]s, and especially the study of the world as a thing separate from ourselves, should be able to lead us to a firm and unchanging [[knowledge]] of ourselves and the world around us. The term is named after Descartes because of his well-known emphasis on "mind" as different from "body", "[[self]]" as different from "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]". 

[[Richard J. Bernstein]] coined the term in his 1983 book ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2015">The '''Cheng–Zhu school''' ({{zh|p=Chéng Zhū lĭxué|t=程朱理學}}), is one of the major philosophical schools of [[Neo-Confucianism]], based on the ideas of the Neo-Confucian philosophers [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]], [[Cheng Hao]], and [[Zhu Xi]]. It is also referred to as the Rationalistic School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qs9W6Km6UC&amp;pg=PA545#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy |pages=545&amp;ndash;546 |isbn=9781400820030 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhu Xi's formulation of the Neo-Confucian world view is as follows. He believed that the Dao (Chinese: 道; pinyin: dào; literally "way") of Tian (Chinese: 天; pinyin: tiān; literally "heaven") is expressed in principle or li (Chinese: 理; pinyin: lǐ), but that it is sheathed in matter or qi (Chinese: 氣; pinyin: qì). In this, his system is based on Buddhist systems of the time that divided things into principle (again, li), and shi (Chinese: 事; pinyin: shì). In the Neo-Confucian formulation, li in itself is pure and almost-perfect, but with the addition of qi, base emotions and conflicts arise. Human nature is originally good, the Neo-Confucians argued (following Mencius), but not pure unless action is taken to purify it. The imperative is then to purify one's li. However, in contrast to Buddhists and Daoists, neo-Confucians did not believe in an external world unconnected with the world of matter. In addition, Neo-Confucians in general rejected the idea of reincarnation and the associated idea of karma.

Different Neo-Confucians had differing ideas for how to do so. Zhu Xi believed in gewu (Chinese: 格物; pinyin: géwù), the Investigation of Things, essentially an academic form of observational science, based on the idea that li lies within the world.

'''Chronocentrism''' is the assumption that certain time periods (typically the [[present]]) are better, more important, or a more significant frame of reference than other time periods, either past or future.

==History==
Chronocentrism (from the Greek ''[[wikt:chrono-|chrono-]]'' meaning "time") was coined by sociologist Jib Fowles in an article in the journal ''Futures'' in February, 1974. Fowles described chronocentrism as "the belief that one's own times are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fowles |first1=Jib |title=On Chronocentrism |work=Futures |volume=6 |number=1 |doi=10.1016/0016-3287(74)90008-1 |date=February 1974 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "the egotism that one's own generation is poised on the very cusp of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Standage |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Standage |title=[[The Victorian Internet|The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's On-line Pioneers]] |year=2007 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |isbn=0-8027-1604-0 |pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term had been used earlier in a study about attitudes to ageing in the workplace. Chronocentricity: "...only seeing the value of one's own age cohort...described the tendency for younger managers to hold negative perceptions of the abilities or other work-related competencies of older employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyon |first1=Phil |last2=Pollard |first2=D|title=Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing?|journal=Personnel Review|volume=26 |number=4 |doi=10.1108/00483489710172051|date=1 January 1997 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination is a form of [[ageism]].

==Ethnocentrism==

Chronocentrism as [[ethnocentrism]] is the perceiving and judging of a culture's historical values in terms of the standards of one's own time period.

==Antichronocentrism==

The [[Long Now Foundation]] is an organization that encourages the use of 5-digit years, e.g. "02016" instead of "2016," to help emphasize how early the present time is in their vision of the timeline of humanity.  The use of two-digit years before [[Y2K]] was an example of chronocentrism (in the early years of computing, the years 2000 and 1899 were believed to be too far in the future or the past, and thus of less importance than being able to save two digits in computerizing and typing out years).

==In science==
The "Copernican time principle" is a temporal analog of the [[Copernican principle]] for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e., that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g., in outdated [[steady-state theories]]), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g., the [[Big-Bang singularity]] is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events.)

Conscious evolution refers to the ability of the human species to choose what the species [[Homo sapiens|''Homo sapiens'']] will become in the future, based on recent advancements in science, medicine, technology, psychology, sociology, and spirituality. Most leading thinkers in this area have focused on the conscious evolution of how we think, live, organize ourselves, work together, and address issues, rather than on [[evolution|biological evolution]]. 

The idea of conscious evolution is not a specific theory, but it has loose connections to [[Ervin László|integral theory]], [[Spiral Dynamics]], and [[noosphere]] thought.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/conscious-evolution-save-humanity-planet/|title=Eco-Futurist Creates Revolutionary 10 Point Plan To Save Humanity &amp; The Planet|date=2015-11-28|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes connected to the theory of the [[global brain]] or [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some have suggested “conscious cultural-evolution”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-04-01|title=Accounting’s contribution to a conscious cultural evolution: an end to sustainable development|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045235403000236|journal=Critical Perspectives on Accounting|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=185–208|doi=10.1016/S1045-2354(03)00023-6|issn=1045-2354}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a more accurate term, to reduce association with standard [[Evolution|biological evolution]], though this is not widely applied.

Conscious evolution suggests that now that humanity is conscious of its history and of how things evolve (evolutionary consciousness), and given the rapid pace of change in society and culture, humanity can (and should) choose advancement through co-operation, co-creation and sustainable practices over self-destruction through separateness, competition, and ecological devastation.

== Conscious Evolution - A Mechanism ==

At the centre of the concept of conscious evolution are the approximate definitions of the term’s constituent phenomena ('[[consciousness]]' and '[[evolution]]'). However, the term implies more than these phenomena generally encompass, not least as it is often used with strong assumptions of a collective interest/ common good.

Evolution does not exclusively act upon [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] ([[Phenotype|phenotypic]]) variation; it can also work on a cognitive level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] has suggested that evolution is simply a process which uses [[natural selection]] as a basic [[algorithm]] for progression.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=0-684-82471-X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be applied to changes in behaviours, practices, concepts, theories and ideas ([[cultural evolution]]). In these situations the mutating [[The Selfish Gene#"Replicators"|replicators]] of evolution can be considered [[Meme|memes]] (theoretical units of cultural information)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The selfish gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than [[Gene|genes]]. Over the last 10,000 years humanity is increasingly capable of influencing its own environment and cognitively adapting to these environmental changes through the use of evolving [[Meme|memes]]. [[Memetics|Memetic]] (cognitive) innovation (as opposed to morphological variation) has therefore become the primary driver of humanity’s [[Evolution|evolutionary success]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Humans are ‘[[Consciousness|conscious]]’, and are consciously manipulating the [[Meme|memes]] they use. Consciousness itself (in humans’ brains) can therefore be said to have agency over its own evolution, because [[Memetics|memetic]] usage influences evolutionary success. Evolution is also something humans are conscious of. Consciousness (in human brains) can therefore be simultaneously conscious of evolution (working in this case upon [[Meme|memes]]) while consciously manipulating its own [[memetics]], in order to influence its own [[evolution]]. Evolution (in the sense of its impact upon [[memetics]]) is therefore increasingly a subject of knowledge, rather than an unknown pressure operating on the world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banathy|first=Bela H.|date=2003-01-16|title=Self-guided/conscious evolution|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/sres.506|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=309–321|doi=10.1002/sres.506|issn=1092-7026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conscious Evolution - Writers and Thinkers ==

Conscious evolution is largely the output of several luminaries’ personal evolutionary journeys&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://integralleadershipreview.com/11697-integral-conscious-evolution/|title=8/15 – Integral Conscious Evolution - Integral Leadership Review|last=Taborga|first=Jorge|date=|website=integralleadershipreview.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The central objective is to achieve a globally sustainable future by developing the idea that humans can guide evolution, now that we are conscious of it (evolutionary consciousness)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Owing to the broad definition of the term, numerous writers and thinkers, from a range of fields and backgrounds have contributed ideas to the concept of conscious evolution. These include; [[Erich Jantsch]], [[Teilhard de Chardin]], [[Jonas Salk]], [[Ervin Laszlo]], [[Mihaly Csikszentmihaly]], [[Bela H. Banathy]], [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]], [[David Bohm#Consciousness and thought|David Bohm]], [[Eric Chaisson]], [[Duane Elgin]], [[Brian Swimme]], [[Ken Wilber]], [http://integralleadershipreview.com/11697-integral-conscious-evolution/ Jorge Taborga] and others.

One of the earliest uses of the phrase 'conscious evolution' may be that of [[Mary Parker Follett]] in 1918: ''"Conscious evolution means giving less and less place to herd instinct and more to the group imperative. We are emerging from our gregarious condition and are now to enter on the rational way of living by scanning our relations to one another, instead of bluntly feeling them, and so adjusting them that unimpeded progress on this higher plane is secured''.''"'' (''The New State'', p. 91)

Human evolution, has thus far been the consequence of billions of random events and chance interactions (as opposed to a planned endeavour).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolving Self: A Psychology for the New Millenium|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=M.|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that humans have knowledge of this evolutionary process (evolutionary consciousness) it is the task of humanity to take control of these random changes, to avoid the '[[Extinction|disastrous fate]]' (extinction) that has befallen the majority of species that have ever existed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This idea that evolutionary consciousness should be used as a tool, or even an argument for self-guided evolution, is a major central theme of the concept of conscious evolution. [[Béla H. Bánáthy|Bela H. Banathy]] &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; captures this sentiment succinctly in his paper ''Self guided/conscious evolution'': ''“Our consciousness of evolution becomes a springboard for leaping into conscious evolution.”''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The issue then arises of how humanity can be expected to know how it should use its recently acquired evolutionary consciousness to select the best evolutionary path.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Reality: Merging Intuition and Reason|last=Salk|first=J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Salk|Jonas Salks]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; is optimistic that humanity is capable of merging intuition with reason in order to find the path that leads to conscious evolution: ''“It now remains for human beings to decide the ultimate course of human evolution. By imagining ourselves inside the process of evolution and by imagining the process of evolution working inside our minds, we may discover how to deal with the opportunities that might influence the direction of evolutionary choices.”''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Tom Atlee|Co-intelligence]]; a form of [[group intelligence]] that incorporates group wisdom for the benefit of humanity, is a concept [[Tom Atlee]] has stressed as an essential foundation for conscious evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atlee|first=Tom|date=2008|title=Co-intelligence, Collective Intelligence, and Conscious Evolution|url=https://co-intelligence.org/AtleeInSteeleCI-Bk.doc|journal=Collective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace|volume=Earth Intelligence Network|pages=5-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Atlee|Atlee]] suggested that many of the factors of [[Tom Atlee|co-intelligence]] (wisdom, intentionality, choice, awareness) could be used as tools to enhance consciousness and improve shared circumstances. [[Eric Chaisson]] similarly identified ‘knowledge’ and ‘compassion’ as key guiding forces for the future,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Era|last=Chaisson|first=E.|publisher=The Atlantic Monthy Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating in 1987 that we must “act wisely, quite beyond intelligently, in order to achieve successful ethical evolution”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson’s]] main emphasis, however, was on [[ethics]], which he argued was the most important focus for ensuring effective conscious evolution: ''“if our species is to survive to enjoy the future, then we must make synonymous the words ‘future’ and ‘ethical,’ thus terming our next evolutionary epoch ‘ethical evolution’”''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Numerous aspects of both [[Tom Atlee|co-intelligence]] and [[ethics]], in our self-guided, conscious evolution are also present in the writings of [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], one of the most widely published advocates of conscious evolution. [[Barbara Marx Hubbard|Hubbard]] has a positive opinion of humanity and the evolutionary process.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conscious Evolution|last=Hubbard|first=B.|publisher=New World Library|year=1996|isbn=|location=Novato, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has claimed that: “Every tendency in us leads us toward greater wholeness, unity, and connectedness... Integration is inherent in the process of evolution.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, Hubbard has been criticised for focusing on the most hopeful evidence that conscious evolution is taking humanity in a positive direction.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/hubbard.html|title=Conscious Evolution :: A Book Review by Scott London|last=London|first=Scott|website=www.scottlondon.com|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott London commented in a review of her 1998 book ''Conscious Evolution; Awakening the Power of Our Social Potential'', that much of the evidence provided was ''“soft data”'', ''“highly questionable”'', or ''“anecdotal”''.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Despite these criticisms [[Barbara Marx Hubbard|Hubbard]], and numerous other advocates of conscious evolution, are continuing to promote the concept, with some suggesting it be included in education and government&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

'''Cosmography''' is the science that [[map]]s the general features of the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]], describing both [[heaven]] and [[Earth]] (but without encroaching on [[geography]] or [[astronomy]]). The 14th-century work ''[['Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat]]'' by [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] is considered to be an early work of cosmography.

Traditional Hindu, Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmography schematize a universe centered on [[Mount Meru]] surrounded by rivers, continents and seas.  These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.

an Engraving on Wood, attributed to---&gt; &amp;ndash; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], in the "Cosmographie" of Munster (Basle, 1552, folio).]]
In 1551, [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], from [[Zaragoza]], Spain, published ''[[Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar]]''. Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.

[[Peter Heylin]]'s 1652 book ''Cosmographie'' (enlarged from his ''Microcosmos'' of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and being the first known description of [[Australia]] and among the first of [[California]]. The book has 4 sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]'', including Australia, and extending to [[Utopia]], [[Álfheimr|Fairyland]], and the "Land of [[Chivalry|Chivalrie]]".

In 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive ''Compendious Description of the Whole World'', which also included a [[chronology]] of world events from [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] forward. These were all part of a major trend in the [[European Renaissance]] to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.

The word was also commonly used by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his lectures.

In [[astrophysics]], the term "cosmography" is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|matter distribution]] and [[kinematics]] of the [[universe|observable universe]], dependent on the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] but independent of the temporal dependence of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The question of the '''eternity of the world''' was a concern for both [[Ancient philosophy|ancient philosophers]] and the medieval [[Medieval theology|theologians]] and [[Medieval philosophy|philosophers]] of the 13th century. The question is whether the world has a beginning in time, or whether it has existed from [[eternity]].  The problem became a focus of a dispute in the 13th century, when some of the works of [[Aristotle]], who believed in the eternity of the world, were rediscovered in the [[Latin West]]. This view conflicted with the view of the [[Catholic church]] that the world had a beginning in time.  The Aristotelian view was prohibited in the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277]].

==Aristotle==

The ancient philosopher [[Aristotle]] argued that the world must have existed from eternity in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' as follows.  In Book I, he argues that everything that comes into [[existence]] does so from a [[Hypokeimenon|substratum]]. Therefore, if the underlying matter of the universe came into existence, it would come into existence from a substratum.  But the nature of matter is precisely to be the substratum from which other things arise.  Consequently, the underlying matter of the universe could have come into existence only from an already existing matter exactly like itself; to assume that the underlying matter of the universe came into existence would require assuming that an underlying matter already existed. As this assumption is self-contradictory, Aristotle argued, matter must be eternal.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' I, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book VIII, his argument from [[Motion (physics)|motion]] is that if an absolute beginning of motion should be assumed, the object to undergo the first motion must either 
:(A) have come into existence and begun to move, or 
:(B) have existed in an eternal state of rest before beginning to move.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle in Physics VIII, 1, 251a, 8-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Option A is self-contradictory because an object cannot move before it comes into existence, and the act of coming into existence is itself a "movement," so that the first movement requires a movement before it, that is, the act of coming into existence. Option B is also unsatisfactory for two reasons.
* First, if the world began at a state of rest, the coming into existence of that state of rest would itself have been motion.
* Second, if the world changed from a state of rest to a state of motion, the cause of that change to motion would itself have been a motion.

He concludes that motion is necessarily eternal.

Aristotle argued that a "[[vacuum]]" (that is, a place where there is no matter) is impossible.  Material objects can come into existence only in place, that is, occupy space.  Were something to come from nothing, "the place to be occupied by what comes into existence would previously have been occupied by a vacuum, inasmuch as no body existed."  But a vacuum is impossible, and matter must be eternal.

The Greek philosopher [[Critolaus]] (c. 200-c. 118 BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorandi  |first=Tiziano |chapter=Chapter 2: Chronology |editor-last=Algra |editor-first=Keimpe |display-editors=etal |year=1999 |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |page=50 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521250283 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Phaselis]] defended Aristotle's doctrine of the eternity of the world, and of the human race in general, against the [[Stoics]].  There is no observed change in the natural order of things; humankind recreates itself in the same manner according to the capacity given by [[Nature]], and the various ills to which it is heir, though fatal to individuals, do not avail to modify the whole. Just as it is absurd to suppose that humans are merely earth-born, so the possibility of their ultimate destruction is inconceivable. The world, as the manifestation of eternal order, must itself be eternal.

==The Neo-Platonists==
The Neoplatonist philosopher [[Proclus]] (412 – 485 AD) advanced in his ''De Aeternitate Mundi'' (On the Eternity of the World) eighteen proofs for the eternity of the world, resting on the divinity of its creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contributor-last=Lang |contributor-first=Helen  |contribution=Introduction |page=2 |author=Proclus |year=2001 |title=On the Eternity of the World |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn = 0-520-22554-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 529 [[John Philoponus]] wrote his critique ''[[Against Proclus]]'' in which he systematically argued against every proposition put forward for the eternity of the world. The intellectual battle against eternalism became one of Philoponus’ major preoccupations and dominated several of his publications (some now lost) over the following decade.

Philoponus originated the argument now known as the [[Traversal of the infinite]].  If the existence of something requires that something else exist before it, then the first thing cannot come into existence without the thing before it existing. An infinite number cannot actually exist, nor be counted through or 'traversed', or be increased. Something cannot come into existence if this requires an infinite number of other things existing before it.  Therefore the world cannot be infinite.

The Aristotelian commentator [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] and contemporary of Philoponus argued against the Aristotelian view.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Arist. de Caelo'', 6, b, etc., 72; ''in Phys. Ausc.'' 257, 262, etc., 312, etc., 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philoponus' arguments===
Philoponus' arguments for temporal finitism were severalfold.  ''Contra Aristotlem'' has been lost, and is chiefly known through the citations used by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in his commentaries on Aristotle's ''Physics'' and ''De Caelo''.  Philoponus' refutation of Aristotle extended to six books, the first five addressing ''De Caelo'' and the sixth addressing ''Physics'', and from comments on Philoponus made by Simplicius can be deduced to have been quite lengthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davidson |first=Herbert A. |date=April–June 1969 |title=John Philoponus as a Source of Medieval Islamic and Jewish Proofs of Creation |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |pages=357–391 |doi=10.2307/596519 |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=89 |number=2 |jstor=596519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full exposition of Philoponus' several arguments, as reported by Simplicius, can be found in Sorabji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sorabji |first=Richard |year=2005  |chapter=Did the Universe have a Beginning? |title=The Philosophy of the Commentators, 200–600 AD |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0-8014-8988-1 |pages=175–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such argument was based upon Aristotle's own theorem that there were not multiple infinities, and ran as follows:  If time were infinite, then as the universe continued in existence for another hour, the infinity of its age since creation at the end of that hour must be one hour greater than the infinity of its age since creation at the start of that hour.  But since Aristotle holds that such treatments of infinity are impossible and ridiculous, the world cannot have existed for infinite time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Daniels |first=Mark |date= |title=What's New in Ancient Philosophy |work=Philosopny Now |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/20/Whats_New_in_Ancient_Philosophy}}{{full|date=March 2016|reason=needs a date as this is a series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philoponus′s works were adopted by many; his first argument against an infinite past being the "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=June 1979 |title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=30 |issue=2  |pages=165–170 [165–166] |doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"An actual infinite cannot exist."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite."
:"Thus an infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist."

This argument defines event as equal increments of time. Philoponus argues that the second premise is not controversial since the number of events prior to today would be an actual infinite without beginning if the universe is eternal. The first premise is defended by a reductio ad absurdum where Philoponus shows that actual infinites can not exist in the actual world because they would lead to contradictions albeit being a possible mathematical enterprise. Since an actual infinite in reality would create logical contradictions, it can not exist including the actual infinite set of past events. The second argument, the "argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition", states:&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

:"An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition."
:"The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition."
:"Thus the temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite."

The first statement states, correctly, that a finite (number) cannot be made into an infinite one by the finite addition of more finite numbers. The second skirts around this; the analogous idea in mathematics, that the (infinite) sequence of negative integers "..-3, -2, -1" may be extended by appending zero, then one, and so forth; is perfectly valid.

==Medieval period==
[[Avicenna]] argued that {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} prior to a thing's coming into actual existence, its existence must have been '[[Logical possibility|possible]].'  Were its existence [[necessary truth|necessary]], the thing would already have existed, and were its existence impossible, the thing would never exist.  The possibility of the thing must therefore in some sense have its own existence.  Possibility cannot exist in itself, but must reside within a subject.  If an already existent matter must precede everything coming into existence, clearly nothing, including matter, can come into existence ''[[ex nihilo]]'', that is, from absolute nothingness.  An absolute beginning of the existence of matter is therefore impossible.

The Aristotelian commentator [[Averroes]] supported Aristotle's view, particularly in his work ''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]'' (''Tahafut al-tahafut''), in which he defended [[Aristotelian philosophy]] against [[al-Ghazali]]'s claims in ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' (''Tahafut al-falasifa'').

Averroes' contemporary [[Maimonides]] challenged Aristotle's assertion that "everything in existence comes from a substratum," on that basis that his reliance on induction and analogy is a fundamentally flawed means of explaining unobserved phenomenon.  According to Maimonides, to argue that "because I have never observed something coming into existence without coming from a substratum it cannot occur" is equivalent to arguing that "because I cannot [[Empiricism|empirically]] observe eternity it does not exist."

Maimonides himself held that neither creation nor Aristotle's infinite time were provable, or at least that no proof was available. (According to scholars of his work, he didn't make a formal distinction between unprovability and the simple absence of proof.) However, some of Maimonides' Jewish successors, including [[Gersonides]] and [[Crescas]], conversely held that the question was decidable, philosophically.&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feldman |first=Seymour |year=1967 |title=Gersonides' Proofs for the Creation of the Universe |journal=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research |volume=35 |pages=113–137 |doi=10.2307/3622478 |publisher=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research |jstor=3622478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, the 'Latin Averroists' were a group of philosophers writing in Paris in the middle of the thirteenth century, who included [[Siger of Brabant]], [[Boethius of Dacia]].  They supported Aristotle's doctrine of the eternity of the world against conservative theologians such as [[John Pecham]] and [[Bonaventure]]. The conservative position is that the world can be logically proved to have begun in time, of which the classic exposition is Bonaventure's argument in the second book of his commentary on [[Sentences|Peter Lombard's sentences]], where he repeats Philoponus' case against a traversal of the infinite.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas]], like Maimonides, argued against both the conservative theologians and the Averroists, claiming that neither the eternity nor the finite nature of the world could be proved by logical argument alone. According to Aquinas the possible eternity of the world and its creation would be contradictory if an efficient cause were precede its effect in duration or if non-existence precedes existence in duration. But an efficient cause, such as God, which instantaneously produces its effect would not necessarily precede its effect in duration.  God can also be distinguished from a natural cause which produces its effect by [[Motion (physics)|motion]], for a cause that produces motion must precede its effect. God could be an instantaneous and motionless creator, and could have created the world without preceding it in time. To Aquinas, that the world began was an article of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. his [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/aquinas-eternity.asp ''De eternitate mundi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the Averroists was condemned by [[Stephen Tempier]] in 1277.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

'''The principle of evidential existentiality''' in [[philosophy]] is a principle that explains and gives value to the [[existence]] of entities. The principle states that the reality of an entity's existence gives greater value to prove its existence than would be given through any outward studies. The principle has become a backbone of [[Arguments for the existence of God|the God argument]], stating that because God is a [[self-evidence|self-evident]] entity, His existence can only be shared by humans, thus proof of God is unnecessary and moot.
It appears that the existence is primarily evident to the self only. The God or Supreme self is perceivable to the self. So evidentially self perception is followed by God perception and so on.

'''Experimentalism''' is the philosophical belief that the way to truth is through [[experiment]]s and [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/experimentalism |title=Experimentalism |work=Your Dictionary |publisher=LoveToKnow Corporation |accessdate=29 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with [[instrumentalism]], the belief that truth should be evaluated based upon its demonstrated usefulness. Deborah Mayo suggests that we should focus on how experimental knowledge is actually arrived at and how it functions in science&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worrall|first=John|last2=Mayo|first2=Deborah G.|last3=Smart|first3=J. J. C.|last4=Barnes|first4=Barry|date=2000-07-01|title=What is this thing called philosophy of science?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02913603|journal=Metascience|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=172–198|doi=10.1007/BF02913603|issn=0815-0796}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Mayo also suggests that the reason New Experimentalists have come up short, is that the part of experiments that have the most to offer in building an account of inference and evidence that are left untapped: designing, generating, modelling and analysing experiments and data.

Less formally, artists often pursue their visions through trial and error; [[experimental arts|this form]] of experimentalism has been practiced in every field, from [[Experimental music|music]] to [[Experimental film|film]] and from [[Experimental literature|literature]] to [[Experimental theatre|theatre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4805">In [[philosophy]], '''facticity''' ({{Lang-fr|facticité}}, {{Lang-de|Faktizität}})&lt;ref name="Faktizität"&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel O. |last=Dahlstrom |title=The Heidegger Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUtMAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |date=2013 | pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5aWnJDAxbfwC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22facticity+(Faktizität)%22 71–2] |isbn=978-1-847-06514-8 |id={{ISBN|1-84706514-7}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a multiplicity of meanings from "factuality" and "contingency" to the intractable conditions of [[human existence]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul. ''[[Being and Nothingness]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early usage==

The term is first used by German philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762-1814) and has a variety of meanings. It can refer to facts and factuality, as in nineteenth-century [[positivism]], but comes to mean that which resists explanation and interpretation in [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Neo-Kantianism]]. The Neo-Kantians contrasted facticity with ideality, as does [[Jürgen Habermas]] in ''[[Between Facts and Norms]]'' (''Faktizität und Geltung'').

==Heidegger==
German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889-1976) discusses "facticity"&lt;ref name="Faktizität"/&gt; as the "[[thrownness]]" (''Geworfenheit'') of individual existence, which is to say we are "thrown into the world."  By this, he is not only referring to a brute fact, or the factuality of a concrete historical situation, e.g., "born in the '80s." Facticity is something that already informs and has been taken up in existence, even if it is unnoticed or left unattended. As such, facticity is not something we come across and directly behold. In moods, for example, facticity has an enigmatic appearance, which involves both turning toward and away from it. For Heidegger, moods are conditions of thinking and willing to which they must in some way respond. The ''thrownness'' of human existence (or ''[[Dasein]]'') is accordingly disclosed through moods.

==Sartre and de Beauvoir==
In the mid-20th Century works of French existentialists [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], facticity signifies all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited. For example, these may include the time and place of birth, a language, an environment, an individual's previous choices, as well as the inevitable prospect of their death. For example: currently, the situation of a person who is born without legs precludes their freedom to walk on the beach; if future medicine were to develop a method of growing new legs for that person, their facticity might no longer exclude this activity.

==Recent usage==
It is a term that takes on a more specialized meaning in 20th century [[continental philosophy]], especially in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]], including [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]. Recent philosophers such as [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], and [[François Raffoul]] have taken up the notion of facticity in new ways.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Facticity plays a key part in [[Quentin Meillassoux]]'s philosophical project to challenge the thought-world relationship of [[correlationism]].  It is defined by him as “the absence of reason for any reality; in other words, the impossibility of providing an ultimate ground for the existence of any being.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meillassoux |first=Quentin |authorlink=Quentin Meillassoux |title=Time Without Becoming |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0uhYxWi1vLoJ:https://speculativeheresy.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/3729-time_without_becoming.pdf+&amp;hl=en |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1294">In [[moral philosophy|moral]] and [[legal philosophy]], there exists a distinction between the concepts of [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and [[licence]]. The former deals with the rights of the individual; the latter covers the expressed permission (or lack thereof) for more than one individual to engage in an activity.&lt;!--*"I define license as interfering with another's freedom." ---AS Neill.--&gt;

As a result, freedoms usually include rights which are usually recognized (often, not always, in an unconditional manner) by the government (and access to which is theoretically enforced against any and all interferences). Licenses, on the other hand, are distributed to individuals who make use of a specific item, expressing the permission to use the item or service under specified, conditional terms and boundaries of usage.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s views on women have attracted controversy, beginning during his life and continuing to the present.

==Attitudes in public and in private==
Ida von Miaskowski{{who|date=November 2018}} remarked in her memoir, published 7 years after his death:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the eighties, when Nietzsche's later writings containing some of the oft-quoted sharp words against women appeared, my husband sometimes told me jokingly not to tell people of my friendly relations with Nietzsche, since this was not very flattering for me. It was just a joke. My husband, like myself, always kept friendly memories of Nietzsche [...] his behavior precisely towards women was so sensitive, so natural and comradely, that even today in old age I cannot regard Nietzsche as a despiser of women.&lt;ref&gt;Ida von Miaskowski, cited in S. L. Gilman (Ed.), D. J. Parent (Trans.), ''Conversations with Nietzsche, A Life in the Words of His Contemporaries'',  Oxford University Press, 1987, p52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Remarks in his writings==
Nietzsche wrote specifically about his views on women in Section VII of ''Human, All Too Human'', which seems to hold women in high regard; but given some of his other comments, his overall attitude towards women is ambivalent. For instance, while in ''Human, All Too Human'', he states that "the perfect woman is a higher type of human than the perfect man, and also something much more rare," there are a number of contradictions and subtleties in Nietzsche's thought elsewhere which are not easily reconcilable. He could be both in praise and contempt of women at one time or another. For instance, in the following passage: "What inspires respect for woman, and often enough even fear, is her nature, which is more “natural” than man’s, the genuine, cunning suppleness of a beast of prey, the tiger’s claw under the glove, the naiveté of her egoism, her uneducability and inner wildness, the incomprehensibility, scope, and movement of her desires and virtues." (''Beyond Good and Evil'', section 239.)

His attitude can sometimes be entirely disparaging: "From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than truth—her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty." In section 6 in "Why I Write Such Excellent Books" of ''Ecce Homo'', he claims that "goodness" in women is a sign of "physiological degeneration", and that women are on the whole cleverer and more wicked than men- which in Nietzsche's view, constitutes a compliment. Yet he goes on to claim that the emancipation of women, and feminists, was merely the resentment of some women against other women, who were physically better constituted and able to bear children.

Despite Nietzsche's writings being viewed as being misogynistic by many, others, such as [[Anthony Ludovici]], insist that he is only an [[anti-feminist]], not a misogynist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ludovici|first1=Anthony|title=Enemies of Women (The Origins in Outline of Anglo-Saxon Feminism)|date=1948|publisher=Carroll &amp; Nicholson Limited|location=London|page=VII|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writings include:

"Woman's love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love... Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best cows... (''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', On the Friend)

"Woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant... she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine: or better, she makes the strong weak--she rules when she succeeds in overcoming the strong... Woman has always conspired with the types of decadence, the priests, against the 'powerful', the 'strong', the men-" ([[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]] - 864, Second German edition of 1906) (It must be noted, however, that ''The Will to Power'' is a gathering of notes and fragments assembled through his sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] and others which were never approved by Nietzsche himself to be published.)

==Possible influence from Aristotle==
Scholars of [[Aristotle]] have drawn comparisons between Nietzsche's views on women and [[Aristotle's views on women]]. They have argued that Nietzsche may have borrowed much of his political philosophy from the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will (1926 (2006). The Story of Philosophy. United States: Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., p. 86 ,{{ISBN|978-0-671-73916-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Nietzsche's anthropology==
Some philosophers{{who|date=August 2015}} have even suggested that Nietzsche's philosophy cannot be understood or analyzed apart from his remarks on women. They discuss the fact that Nietzsche's work has been useful in the development of some feminist theory but ultimately conclude "While Nietzsche challenges traditional hierarchies between mind and body, reason and irrationality, nature and culture, truth and fiction - hierarchies that have been used to degrade and exclude women - his remarks about women and his use of feminine and maternal metaphors throughout his writings confound attempts simply to proclaim Nietzsche a champion of feminism or women."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Oliver, Marilyn Pearsall, "Introduction: Why Feminists Read Nietzsche", in Feminist Interpretations of Friedrich Nietzsche, Penn State Press, 1998, pp 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Salomé==
[[Lou Andreas-Salomé]], who knew Nietzsche very well, and claimed that he had proposed to her (according to her, she refused him) claimed there was something feminine in Nietzsche's "spiritual nature", and that he had considered genius to be a feminine genius.&lt;ref&gt;Biddy Martin, Women and Modernity: The (Life)Styles of Lou Andreas-Salomé, Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1991, p98&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2018}}

==Apparent misogyny as rhetorical strategy==
Frances Nesbitt Oppel interprets Nietzsche's attitude towards women as part of a [[rhetoric]]al strategy.&lt;blockquote&gt;...Nietzsche's apparent misogyny is part of his overall strategy to demonstrate that our attitudes toward sex-gender are thoroughly cultural, are often destructive of our own potential as individuals and as a species, and may be changed. What looks like misogyny may be understood as part of a larger strategy whereby "woman-as-such" (the universal essence of woman with timeless character traits) is shown to be a product of male desire, a construct.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Nesbitt Oppel, Nietzsche on Gender, University of Virginia Press, 2005, p1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Not advocating a model for others==
{{POV-section|date=June 2014}}
Others exhibit a less tolerant sophistication, though some recognize that Nietzsche made these remarks from a consciously relative position, and while they show little patience for his remarks overall they recognize that however odious his individual opinion of women may have been, he was not advocating it as a model for others. Cornelia Klinger states in her book ''Continental Philosophy in Feminist Perspective'': "Nietzsche, like Schopenhauer a prominent hater of women, at least relativizes his savage statements about woman-as-such."&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Klinger, Herta Nagl-Docekal, Continental Philosophy in Feminist Perspective, Penn State Press, 2002, p224&lt;/ref&gt; One of Nietzsche's own statements is cited in support of this assertion:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whenever a cardinal problem is at stake, there speaks an unchangeable "this is I"; about man and woman, for example, a thinker cannot relearn but only finish learning–only discover ultimately how this is "settled in him." At times we find certain solutions of problems that inspire strong faith in ''us''; some call them henceforth ''their'' "convictions." Later–we see them only as steps to self-knowledge, signposts to the problem we ''are''–rather, to the great stupidity we are, to our spiritual ''fatum'', to what is ''unteachable'' very "deep down". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this abundant civility that I have just evidenced in relation to myself I shall perhaps be permitted more readily to state a few truths about "woman as such"–assuming that it is now known from the outset how very much these are after all only–''my'' truths." (BGE, 7, 231)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Psychological digs and constructions==
Another author takes up this same quote, recognizing that "[a]lthough Nietzsche as generously as ever saves his commentators the labor of interpretation the problem recurs precisely because of the nature of what he proceeds to call his truths." But instead of focusing on putative misogyny she opines:&lt;blockquote&gt;Much more [...] must be thought to affect everything Nietzsche writes about woman. Rather than mere psychological digs and constructions, rather than a simple expression of his own misogyny, Nietzsche's philosophic expression of the nature of woman reflects and repeats the possibilities of the affirmation or denial of illusion. This is Nietzsche's understanding of truth, and to this extent Nietzsche was able to exploit his own misogyny, in style, tracing the Platonic metaphor as such.&lt;ref&gt;Babette E. Babich, ''Nietzsche's Philosophy of Science'', SUNY Press, 1994,  p241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Women as source of all folly and unreason==
As Leonard Lawlor and Zeynep Direk point out, "What Nietzsche ''says'' -and repeats with hysterical insistence- is that woman is the source of all folly and unreason, the siren figure who lures the male philosopher out of his appointed truth-seeking path."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Lawlor and Zeynep Direk, Derrida, Routledge, 2002, p139&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2306">'''Henology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἕν ''hen'', "one") refers to the [[philosophy|philosophical]] account or discourse on "The One" that appears most notably in the philosophy of [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zAYh3Aeem5YC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Henology#PPA118,M1 Four ages of Understanding at Google Books] Retrieved on May 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reiner Schürmann]] describes it as a "metaphysics of radical [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]" that extends beyond [[being]] and intellection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schürmann|first1=Reiner|last2=Lily|first2=Reginald|title=Broken Hegemonies|date=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=0-253-34144-2|pages=143–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eRv1DTW_KoC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Henology#v=onepage&amp;q=Henology&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be contrasted with [[ontology]], as ontology is "an account of being" whereas henology is an "account of unity."

==Areas of inquiry==
Henology stands in contradistinction to several other philosophical disciplines. The term "henology" refers to the discipline that centers around The One, as in the philosophies of [[Plato]] and [[Plotinus]]. It is sometimes used in contradistinction to disciplines that treat [[Being]] as its starting point (as in [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]]) and also to those that seek to understand [[Knowledge]] and [[Truth]] (as in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

'''Idealistic pluralism''' is a philosophical position that suggests while an individual's understanding of the world might be limited to only the ideas within his or her mind, it can be known in this way by more than one mind.

Idealistic pluralism rejects the idea of [[solipsism]], which would be an [[idealistic monism]].  In the philosophy of [[George Berkeley]], an idealistic pluralism is found in his assertion that many minds (each knowing the world though their own representations) exist, separate from each other, and from God.

      <comment>Hard incompatibilism is the "bad" thing here, not giving up belief in it (what Smilansky endorses).</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">'''Illusionism''' is a [[metaphysics|metaphysical theory]] first propounded by professor Saul Smilansky of the [[University of Haifa]].  It holds that people have illusory beliefs about [[free will]].{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}  Furthermore, it holds that it is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society.{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Holroyd|2010|p=110}}  Belief in [[hard incompatibilism]], argues Smilansky, removes an individual's basis for a sense of self-worth in his or her own achievements.  It is "extremely damaging to our view of ourselves, to our sense of achievement, worth, and self-respect".{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}

Neither compatibilism nor hard determinism are the whole story, according to Smilansky, and there exists an ''ultimate perspective'' in which ''some'' parts of compatibilism are valid and ''some'' parts of hard determinism are valid.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=4}}  However, Smilansky asserts, the nature of what he terms the ''fundamental dualism'' between hard determinism and compatibilism is a morally undesirable one, in that both beliefs, in their absolute forms, have adverse consequences.  The distinctions between choice and luck made by compatibilism are important, but wholly undermined by hard determinism.  But, conversely, hard determinism undermines the morally important notions of justice and respect, leaving them nothing more than "shallow" notions.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=6}}

Smilansky's thesis is considered a radical one,{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}} and other philosophers disagree with it.  Professor [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] of Cornell University, for example, disagrees that hard incompatibilism necessarily does away with self-worth, because to a large extent that sense of self-worth isn't related to will at all, let alone to free will.  Aspects of worthiness such as natural beauty, native physical ability, and intelligence are not voluntary.{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}  Professor James Lenman of the University of Glasgow (at the time) takes a similar line, arguing that Smilansky's expression of the problems is overstated.  The problems that he presents are less fundamentally metaphysical than simply practical in nature.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=15–17}}

'''''Lebensphilosophie''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈleːbn̩s.filozoˌfiː|lang}}, "[[philosophy of life]]") is a philosophical [[school of thought]] which emphasises the [[meaning of life|meaning]], value and purpose of life as the foremost focus of philosophy.&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;{{cite book|first=Jason |last=Gaiger |chapter=Lebensphilosophie |title=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |editor1-first=Edward |editor1-last=Craig |publisher=Routledge |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Inspired by the critique of [[rationalism]] in the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''Lebensphilosophie'' emerged in 19th-century Germany as a reaction to the rise of [[positivism]] and the theoretical focus prominent in much of post-Kantian philosophy.&lt;ref name=routledge/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;[[Michael Friedman (philosopher)|Michael Friedman]], ''A Parting of the Ways: Carnap, Cassirer, and Heidegger'', Open Court, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lebensphilosophie'' movement bore indirect relation to the subjectivist philosophy of [[vitalism]] developed by [[Henri Bergson]], which lent importance to [[Immediate experience|immediacy of experience]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|quote=In Germany the corresponding school [to [[vitalism]]], known as ''Lebensphilosophie'' (“philosophy of life”), began to take on aspects of a political ideology in the years immediately preceding World War I. The work of [[Hans Driesch]] and [[Ludwig Klages]], for example, openly condemned the superficial intellectualism of Western civilization. In associating “reason” with the shortcomings of “civilization” and “the West,” Lebensphilosophie spurred many German thinkers to reject intellection in favour of the irrational forces of blood and life. In the words of Herbert Schnädelbach, at this point “philosophy of life tendentiously abolished the traditional difference between nature and culture and thus facilitated the success of the general biologism in the theory of culture, which culminated in National Socialist racism.” |title=Continental philosophy |first=Richard |last=Wolin |authorlink=Richard Wolin |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1308494/continental-philosophy |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twentieth-century forms of ''Lebensphilosophie'' can be identified with a critical stress on norms and conventions. The Israeli-American historian Nitzan Lebovic identified ''Lebensphilosophie'' with the tight relation between a "corpus of life-concepts" and what the German education system came to see, during the 1920s, as the proper ''Lebenskunde'', the ‘teaching of life’ or ‘science of life’—a name that seemed to support the broader philosophical outlook long held by most biologists of the time. In his book Lebovic traces the transformation of the post-Nietzschean ''Lebensphilosophie'' from the radical aesthetics of the [[Stefan George]] Circle to Nazi or "[[biopolitical]]" rhetoric and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Nitzan Lebovic, ''The Philosophy of Life and Death Ludwig Klages and the Rise of a Nazi Biopolitics'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This philosophy pays special attention to ''life'' as a whole, which can only be understood from within. The movement can be regarded as a rejection of [[Kantian]] abstract philosophy or scientific reductionism of positivism.

{{Expert-subject|Philosophy/Eastern|date=November 2008}}
'''''Li''''' （理, pinyin ''[[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|lǐ]]''）is a concept found in [[neo-Confucian]] [[Chinese philosophy]]. 
It refers to the underlying reason and order of nature as reflected in its organic forms.

It may be translated as "rational [[principle]]" or "law." It was central to [[Zhu Xi]]'s integration of [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. Zhu Xi held that ''li'', together with ''[[qi]]'' (氣: vital, material force), depend on each other to create structures of nature and matter. The sum of ''li'' is the ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]''.

This idea resembles the [[Buddhist]] notion of ''li'', which also means "principle." Zhu Xi maintained, however, that his notion is found in ''[[I Ching]]'' (''Book of Changes''), a classic source of [[Chinese philosophy]].
Zhu Xi's school came to be known as the School of ''Li'', which is comparable to [[rationalism]]. To an even greater extent than Confucius, Zhu Xi had a naturalistic world-view. His world-view contained two primary ideas: qi and li. Zhu Xi further believed that the conduct of the two of these took places according to Tai Ji.

Holding to Confucius and Mencius' conception of humanity as innately good, Zhu Xi articulated an understanding of ''li'' as the basic pattern of the universe, stating that it was understood that one couldn't live without ''li'' and live an exemplary life. In this sense, ''li'' according to Zhu Xi is often seen as similar to the [[Tao|Dao]] in [[Taoism|Daoism]] or to [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] and also to the [[Dharma]] in [[Hinduism]] . [[Wang Yangming]], a philosopher who opposed Zhu Xi's ideas, held that ''li'' was to be found not in the world but within oneself. Wang Yangming was thus more of an [[idealist]] with a different [[epistemic]] approach.

==Sources==
The philosophical concept of ''li'' is inherently difficult to define and is easily mistranslated into various simplifications of the core idea.
Many philosophers have tried to better explain it, [[Alan Watts]] being one of the prominent 20th century authors on the subject.
{{Quotation|

The ''tao'' is a certain kind of order, and this kind of order is not quite what we call order when we arrange everything geometrically in boxes, or in rows. That is a very crude kind of order, but when you look at a plant it is perfectly obvious that the plant has order. We recognize at once that it is not a mess, but it is not symmetrical and it is not geometrical looking. The plant looks like a Chinese drawing, because they appreciated this kind of non-symmetrical order so much that it became an integral aspect of their painting. In the Chinese language this is called ''li'', and the character for ''li'' means the markings in jade. It also means the grain in wood and the fiber in muscle. We could say, too, that clouds have ''li'', marble has ''li'', the human body has ''li''. We all recognize it, and the artist copies it whether he is a landscape painter, a portrait painter, an abstract painter, or a non-objective painter. They all are trying to express the essence of ''li''. The interesting thing is, that although we all know what it is, there is no way of defining it. Because ''tao'' is the course, we can also call ''li'' the watercourse, and the patterns of ''li'' are also the patterns of flowing water. We see those patterns of flow memorialized, as it were, as sculpture in the grain in wood, which is the flow of sap, in marble, in bones, in muscles. All these things are patterned according to the basic principles of flow. In the patterns of flowing water you will find all kind of motifs from Chinese art, immediately recognizable, including the S-curve in the circle of yang-yin{{sic}}.

So ''li'' means then the order of flow, the wonderful dancing pattern of liquid, because Lao-tzu likens ''tao'' to water:

The great ''tao'' flows everywhere, to the left and to the right, 
It loves and nourishes all things, but does not lord it over them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14794">A person's '''life stance''', or '''lifestance''', is their relation with what they accept as being of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|ultimate importance]]. It involves the presuppositions and theories upon which such a stance could be made, a [[belief system]], and a commitment to potentially working it out in one's [[personal life|life]].&lt;ref&gt;
For example, as treated in ''[[The Intentional Stance]]'' by [[Daniel Dennett]] {{ISBN|0-262-54053-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It connotes an integrated perspective on reality as a whole and how to assign valuations, thus being a concept similar or equivalent to that of a [[worldview]]; with the latter word (derived from the German "Weltanschauung") being generally a more common and comprehensive term. Like the term "worldview", the term "life stance" is intended{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be a ''shared'' label encompassing both [[religion|religious]] perspectives (for instance: "a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] life stance"  or "a&amp;nbsp;[[Christian]] life&amp;nbsp;stance" or "a [[Neopaganism|Pagan]] life stance"), as well as non-religious spiritual or philosophical alternatives (for instance: "a&amp;nbsp;[[Humanism|humanist]] life&amp;nbsp;stance" or "a [[personism|personist]] life stance" or "a [[Deep Ecology]] life stance"), without discrimination in favour of any.&lt;ref name = "Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;

== Origins of the phrase ==
[[humanism|Humanists]] interested in educational matters apparently coined the [[neologism]] ''life stance'' in the mid-1970s; [[Harry Stopes-Roe]] of the [[Rationalist Association|Rationalist Press Association]] and [[British Humanist Association]] developed the concept originally in that context.&lt;ref&gt;
On "life stance education" see Stopes-Roe (1976), and Stopes-Roe (1983). Compare with the advocacy of "Education in Life Stances" in Cox (1975), on which also see Greer (1985, pp.  16–17)). The British Humanist Association pamphlet, ''Objective, Fair and Balanced'' (1975), includes the text of a letter by Stopes-Roe, printed in the ''Times Educational Supplement'' of 12 July 1974, which refers to "stances for living". It also cites the City of Birmingham's ''Agreed Syllabus of Religious Education'', dated 7 May 1974: "it introduces the new term "stance for living". (British Humanist Association, 1975, p. 15). For the related "life stance education" offered to non-religious pupils in Finland, see Slotte (2008).
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term originally arose in the context of debates over the controversial&lt;ref&gt;
Barnes (2008, p. 75), notes that the controversy reached Parliament.  Hull (1984, p. 111) notes that "an attempt was made in the spring of 1976 to introduce a Private Members Bill into the House of Commons which would have replaced religious education by 'Education in Stances for Living'". The Bill was published in "Objective, Fair and Balanced – a new law for religion in education", written by Harry Stopes-Roe and David Pollock for the British Humanist Association (1975)
&lt;/ref&gt; content of the City of [[Birmingham| Birmingham's]] ''Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education'', 1975.  That document referred to "non-religious stances for living". According to Barnes:

{{quote|It was the first syllabus to abandon the aim of Christian nurture and to embrace a multi-faith, phenomenological model of religious education; and it was also the first syllabus to require a ''systematic'' study of non-religious 'stances for living', such as Humanism, and for such study to begin in the primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes (2008, p. 75)
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s Harry Stopes-Roe initiated a successful campaign for the adoption of the term by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and by other organisations (see also his comments quoted below on its provenance).&lt;ref&gt;
Stopes-Roe's advocacy of the term outside the literature of religious education was first published as Stopes-Roe (1987), but the article was in circulation at a Board meeting of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] in October 1987 (See Walter 1988a, p. 4). The article was reprinted in ''New Humanist'' (Stopes Roe 1988a) and Kurtz (1989). Stopes-Roe revisited the subject in Stopes-Roe (1996), and wrote the article on "Life stance" for the ''New Encyclopedia of Unbelief'' (Stopes-Roe 2007). See also the statement "[http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more Humanism is eight letters, no more]", signed by [[H.J. Blackham|Harold Blackham]], [[Levi Fragell]], [[Corliss Lamont]], [[Harry Stopes-Roe]], and [[Rob Tielman]].
&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was not an uncontroversial proposal among humanists.&lt;ref name = "needforlifestance"&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p. 21) commented that "I have found the degree of opposition to the term "life stance" among Humanists more surprising than the religionist's objection." See also the overview of the debate between Walter (1988a and 1988b) and Stopes-Roe (1988a and 1988b) in Fowler (1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=z5k5A0_nFogC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22life%20stance%22&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22life%20stance%22&amp;f=false pp. 3–4]).
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced as part of an attempt to establish a clear identity for Humanism, in order to gain recognition and respect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more See "Humanism is eight letters, no more"]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stopes-Roe:

{{quote|"Life stance" is an expression that has been current in Britain for more than ten years and is now gaining acceptance worldwide, to describe what is good in both Humanism and religion – without being encumbered by what is bad in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p.19)
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Definition==

Harry Stopes-Roe, who fought for the term's acceptance by the [[Humanism|Humanist]] movement, defined "life stance" as follows:

{{quote|"Life stance" - The style and content of an individual's or a community's relationship with that which is of ultimate importance; the presuppositions and commitments of this, and the consequences for living which flow from it. (Each individual or community hopes that it has come to a good and well-founded relationship, but the word is usually used without implying that this really is so).|[[Harry Stopes-Roe]]&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The British Humanist Association, drawing in part on jurisprudence related to the term "religion or belief" in the European Convention on Human Rights, has put forward a more analytical definition:

{{quote|A collective belief that attains a sufficient level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance and that relates the nature of life and the world to morality, values and/or the way its believers should live.|[[British Humanist Association]]&lt;ref&gt;
Memorandum from the BHA to the Charity Commission on Religion and Non-Religious Beliefs in Charity Law, August 2007: see http://www.humanism.org.uk/documents/3917&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Orthography==
A life stance may be distinguished from general support of a cause by [[capitalization]] of the first letter. For instance, the life stance of Humanism is distinguished from [[humanism]] generally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/DoerrND02.htm Humanism Unmodified] By Edd Doerr. Published in the ''Humanist'' (November/December 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Many life stances may contain humanism to a greater or lesser extent as [[instrumental value]] in order to fulfill their own chosen [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value(s)]]. However, Humanism regards it as having intrinsic value.

Not all life stances use this orthography.

==Spectrum==
The term was intended to be a ''shared'' label encompassing both [[religion]]s and alternatives to religion, without discrimination in favour of either.&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;

A life stance differs from a [[World view|worldview]] or a belief system in that the term ''life stance'' emphasizes a focus on what is of ultimate importance. Life stance differs from [[eupraxsophy]] in that the latter typically implies a strictly non-theistic outlook, whereas a life stance can be theistic or non-theistic, supernaturalistic or naturalistic.

===Religious life stances===
{{Main|Religion}}
A ''religion'' is a set of beliefs and practices, often centered upon specific supernatural and/or moral claims about [[reality]], the [[cosmos]], and [[human nature]], and often codified as [[prayer]], [[ritual]], and [[law]].  Religion also encompasses ancestral or cultural [[tradition]]s, writings, history, and [[mythology]], as well as personal [[faith]] and [[mysticism|mystic experience]]. The term "religion" refers to both the personal practices related to communal faith and to group rituals and communication stemming from shared conviction.

In the frame of [[European religious thought]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane - Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; religions present a common quality, the "hallmark of patriarchal religious thought": the division of the world in two comprehensive domains, [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|one sacred, the other profane]].&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1976, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is often described as a communal system for the coherence of belief focusing on a system of thought, unseen being, person, or object, that is considered to be [[supernatural]], sacred, [[Divinity|divine]], or of the highest [[truth]].  
[[Moral code]]s, practices, values, institutions, tradition, [[philosophy]], rituals, and [[scripture]]s are often traditionally associated with the core belief. Religion is also often described as a "[[way of life]]".

===Non-religious life stances===
{{Further|Irreligion|Secular religion}}
Alternatives to religion include life stances based on [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]], [[deism]], [[Religious skepticism|skepticism]], [[freethought]], [[pantheism]], [[secular humanism]], [[spiritual but not religious]] (SBNR), [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], [[existentialism]], modern incarnations of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]], or general [[secularism]].

====Humanism====

[[Humanism]] is an example of life stance which may be considered to be religious (usually in a non-theistic, ethical sense) or non-religious or anti-religious. One of Stopes-Roe's reasons for advocating the adoption of "life stance" as a label for the Humanist movement, was his hope that it would end the arguments between the different sides as to how best to characterise their position (note that Stopes-Roe uses the term "god-religious" to distinguish theists from non-theists in what follows):

{{quote|Humanists are divided into two camps... according to how they respond to the word "religion". Do they... respond negatively or positively? The ferocity of the antipathy on the one hand, and the power of the concern on the other, that is generated by this word quite obliterates reasoned discussion of many substantial and important questions on how we should develop Humanism. Likewise, our discussions with the god-religious are confused and frustrated. We need a new term for the idea and ideal of religion, opened out so that it is not discriminatory. Let this be "life stance". Could we, perhaps, bury the hatchet of "religion" and work together?&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;}}

Bill Cooke comments:
{{quote|Harry Stopes-Roe's contribution is significant because it makes clear humanism's value as a legitimate system of belief, without it being a pseudo-religion.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke 2003 (p. 223)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4891">{{See also|Chicago school (literary criticism)}}
'''Neo-Aristotelianism''' is a view of [[literature]] and [[rhetorical criticism]] propagated by the [[Chicago school (literary criticism)|Chicago School]]&lt;ref&gt;James P. Beasley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ocq0I7PbxiAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Prehistory of Rhetoric and Composition: New Rhetoric and Neo-Aristotelianism at the University of Chicago, 1947--1959]'', ProQuest, 2007, pp.129&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; [[Ronald S. Crane]], [[Elder Olson]], [[Richard McKeon]], [[Wayne Booth]], and others &amp;mdash; which means.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A view of literature and criticism which takes a pluralistic attitude toward the history of literature and seeks to view literary works and critical theories intrinsically"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/glossary/Neo-Aristotelianism.html
Definition from The University of Toronto National Library&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neo-Artistotelianism was one of the first rhetorical methods of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K.|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central features were first suggested in [[Herbert Wichelns|Herbert A. Wichelns]]' "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" in 1925. It focused on analyzing the methodology behind a speech's ability to convey an idea to its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Herbert A.|last=Wichelns|author-link=Herbert Wichelns|editor-last=Drummond|editor-first=Alexander M.|title=The Literary Criticism of Oratory|encyclopedia=Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Neo-Aristotelianism was further publicized, gaining popularity after William Norwood Brigance published A History and Criticism of American Public Address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brigance|first=William Norwood|title=A History and Criticism of American Public Address|year=1943|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike rhetorical criticism, which concentrates on the study of speeches and the immediate effect of rhetoric on an audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss.|first=Sonja K|title=. Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Aristotelianism "led to the study of a single speaker because the sheer number of topics to cover relating to the rhetor and the speech made dealing with more than a single speaker virtually impossible. Thus, various speeches by different rhetors related by form of topic were not included in the scope of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The Literary Criticism of Oratory"==&lt;!-- The article Herbert Wichelns links here --&gt;
Wichelns' work was one of the first that introduced Neo-Aristotelianism. It narrowed down speech to 12 key topics to be studied, similar to many of the topics discussed by Aristotle in the Rhetoric. His topics for speech critique include:
* Speaker's personality 
* Character of the speaker (how the audience views a speaker) 
* [[Audience]] 
* Major ideas 
* Motives to which the speaker appealed 
* Nature of the speaker's proof (credibility) 
* Speaker's judgment of human nature in the audience 
* Arrangement 
* [[Stylistics (field of study)|Mode of expression]] 
* Speech preparation 
* Delivery 
* Effect of the [[discourse]] on the immediate audience and long-term effects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wichelns|first=Herbert A.|title="The Literary Criticisms of Oratory," in Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Mark S. Klyn, author of Towards a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism, "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" provided "substance and structure to a study which heretofore had been formless and ephemeral [...] it literally created the modern discipline of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klyn|first=Mark S.|title="Toward a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism," in Essays on Rhetorical Criticism|year=1968|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus regardless of the lack of detail on these topics, it provided a modern structure of critiquing and analyzing speech via Neo-Aristotelianism, according to Donald C. Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Donald C.|title=The Rhetorical Idiom: Essays in Rhetoric, Oratory, Language, and Drama|year=1958|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithica|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Philosophy sidebar}}
A '''philosopher''' is someone who practices [[Philosophy|philosophy]], which involves [[reason|rational]] inquiry into areas that are outside either [[theology]] or [[science]].&lt;ref name="RussellHistory10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=10|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "philosopher" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλόσοφος}} (''philosophos'') meaning "lover of wisdom". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BC).&lt;ref name="tufts"&gt;{{LSJ|filo/sofos|φιλόσοφος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classics|classical]] sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]], and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''The Inner Citadel''. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers. A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesn’t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Perry |first= Prof. Ralph Barton |year= 1914 |chapter= Philosophy I: General Introduction: Philosophy and Common Sense |editors= William Allan Neilson, et al.  |title= Lectures on the Harvard Classics |url= https://archive.org/details/harvardclassics51eliouoft |website= Internet Archive |publisher= P.

In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy, such as [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[social theory]], and [[political philosophy]]. A philosopher may also be one who worked in the [[humanities]] or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries, such as [[the arts]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Shook|editor-first1=John R. |title=Dictionary of Modern American philosophers |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-miscMatter-0004 |date=2010 |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199754663 |page=Introduction |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001 |oclc=686766412 |subscription=yes |quote=The label of "philosopher" has been broadly applied in this Dictionary to intellectuals who have made philosophical contributions regardless of an academic career or professional title.

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is about the history of philosophers as an occupation. For a history of philosophy in general, see [[History of philosophy]].}}

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="RussellHistory11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=11|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales]], an astronomer and mathematician, was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Pythagoras]] coined the word, the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by [[Plato]]. In his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', he concludes that Love is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom; if he attains wisdom, he would be a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. Therefore, the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom, and living in accordance to that wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;That is to say philosophically – [[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 27: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed. These disagreements gave rise to different [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic schools of philosophy]]. In consequence, the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 5: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Theologie, exegese, revelation' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate, the competition lay in living in manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 30: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the last of these philosophers was [[Marcus Aurelius]], who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense, but personally refused to call himself by such a title, since he had a duty to live as an [[List of Roman emperors|emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Meditations#THE EIGHTH BOOK]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition====
According to the [[Classicist]] [[Pierre Hadot]], the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes:

The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind. Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 31: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is the historical change through the Medieval era. With the rise of Christianity, the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology. Thus, philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life. Philosophy was then the servant to theology.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 32: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third is the sociological need with the development of the university. The modern university requires professionals to teach. Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty. Therefore, the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'/&gt;

===Medieval era===
In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. [[Gregory of Nyssa]], for example, describes how his sister [[Macrina the Younger|Macrina]] persuaded [[Emmelia of Caesarea|their mother]] to forsake "the distractions of material life" for a life of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Readings in World Christian History'' (2013), pp. 147, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Later during the [[Middle Ages]], persons who engaged with [[alchemy]] was called a philosopher – thus, the [[Philosopher's Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosopher&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern era===
{{rquote|right|''Generally speaking, university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a mirror. In the last analysis, its goal is to give students opinions which are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs... As a result, this state-financed philosophy makes a joke of philosophy. And yet, if there is one thing desirable in this world, it is to see a ray of light fall onto the darkness of our lives, shedding some kind of light on the mysterious enigma of our existence.''|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]}}

Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition, as saw their philosophy as a way of life. Among the most notable are [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended, taught, and developed their works in university. Early examples include: [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 271: ''Philosophy as a Way of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

After these individuals, the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]]. Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern academia===
In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system. According to a 1993 study by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (as reported by the [[American Philosophical Association]]), 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a PhD in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions ([[academia]]). Outside academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine{{vague|date=November 2015}}, [[bioethics]], business, publishing, [[free-lance writing]], media, and law.&lt;ref name=APA-nonacademic&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Committee on Non-Academic Careers|title=A non-academic career?|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=nonacademic|edition=3rd|date=June 1999|publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]]|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key thinkers===
====French social thought====
Some known [[French people|French]] social thinkers are [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri Saint-Simon]], Auguste Comte, and [[Émile Durkheim]].

====British social thought====
[[United Kingdom|British]] social thought, with thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], addressed questions and ideas relating to [[political economy]] and [[social evolution]]. The political ideals of [[John Ruskin]] were a precursor of [[social economy]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'' had a very important impact on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s philosophy).

====German social thought====
Important [[Germany|German]] philosophers and social thinkers included [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Martin Heidegger]].

====Chinese social thought====
Important [[China|Chinese]] philosophers and social thinkers included [[Shang Yang]], [[Lao Zi]], [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], Wang Chong&lt;!-- Chinese name, Wang is the surname --&gt;, [[Wang Yangming]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Wang is the surname --&gt;, [[Li Zhi (philosopher)|Li Zhi]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Li is the surname --&gt;, [[Zhu Xi]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Zhu is the surname --&gt;, [[Gu Yanwu]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Gu is the surname --&gt;, [[Gong Zizhen]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Gong is the surname --&gt;, Wei Yuan&lt;!-- Chinese name, Wei is the surname --&gt;, [[Kang Youwei]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Kang is the surname --&gt;, Lu Xun, [[Mao Zedong]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Mao is the surname --&gt;, [[Xi Jinping]]&lt;!-- Chinese name, Xi is the surname --&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">The '''philosophy of film''' is a branch of [[aesthetics]] within the discipline of [[philosophy]] that seeks to understand the most basic questions regarding [[film]]. Philosophy of film has significant overlap with [[film theory]], a branch of [[film studies]].

== History ==
The earliest person to explore philosophical questions regarding film was [[Hugo Münsterberg]]. During the [[silent film]] era, he sought to understand what it was about film that made it conceptually distinct from theater. He concluded that the use of close-ups, flash-backs, and edits were unique to film and constituted its nature.

[[Rudolf Arnheim]], with the beginning of the era of sound for film, argued that the silent film era was aesthetically superior to the "talkies". He held that by adding sound to previously silent moving images, the unique status of film had been removed. Instead of being a unique art form that could carefully study bodies in motion, film had become merely a combination of two other art forms.

[[André Bazin]], contrary to Arnheim, held that whether or not a film has sound is largely irrelevant. He believed that film, due mainly to its foundation in and relationship with photography, had a realist aspect to it. He argued that film has the ability to capture the real world. The film ''[[Waking Life]]'' also features a discussion of the philosophy of film where the theories of Bazin are emphasized. In it, the character waxes philosophic that every moment of film is capturing an aspect of [[God]].

[[American philosopher]] [[Noël Carroll]] has argued that the earlier characterizations of film made by philosophers too narrowly defined the nature of film and that they incorrectly conflated aspects of genres of films with film in general.

Aspects of Bazin's realist theories have been accepted by philosophers in spite of Carroll's critique. The ''transparency thesis'', which says that film is a medium transparent to true reality, has been accepted by [[Kendall Walton]].

{{selfref|For information about user preferences on Wikipedia, see [[Help:Preferences]], or to view and modify your preferences on Wikipedia, go to [[Special:Preferences]].}}
A '''preference''' is a technical term in psychology, economics and philosophy usually used in relation to choosing between alternatives; someone has a preference for A over B if they would choose A rather than B.

Preference can also be used in insolvency terms.

==Psychology==

In [[psychology]], preferences refer to an individual’s attitude towards a set of objects, typically reflected in an explicit decision-making process (Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 2006). The term is also used to mean evaluative judgment in the sense of liking or disliking an object (e.g., Scherer, 2005) which is the most typical definition employed in psychology. However, it does not mean that a preference is necessarily stable over time. Preference can be notably modified by decision-making processes, such as [[choices]] (Brehm, 1956; Sharot, De Martino, &amp; Dolan, 2009), even unconsciously (see Coppin, Delplanque, Cayeux, Porcherot, &amp; Sander, 2010). Consequently, preference can be affected by a person's surroundings and upbringing in terms of geographical location, cultural background, religious beliefs, and education. These factors are found to affect preference as repeated exposure to a certain idea or concept correlates with a positive preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=Robert B.|last2=Markus|first2=Hazel|date=1982-09-01|title=Affective and Cognitive Factors in Preferences|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/123|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–131|doi=10.1086/208905|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

{{main article|Preference (economics)}}

In [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s, ''preference'' refers to the set of assumptions related to ordering some alternatives, based on the degree of [[happiness]], satisfaction, [[gratification]], enjoyment, or [[utility]] they provide, a process which results in an optimal "[[choice]]" (whether real or imagined). Although economists are usually not interested in choices or preferences in themselves, they are interested in the theory of choice because it serves as a background for empirical demand analysis.

==Marketing==
Brand preference is strongly linked to brand choice that can influence the consumer decision making and activate brand purchase. "Brand preferences can be defined as the subjective, conscious and behavioral tendencies which influence consumer's predisposition toward a brand." Understanding the brand preferences of consumers will dictate the most suitable and successful Marketing Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Prasanna Mohan Raj and Ananth, "Brand Preferences Of Newspapers- Factor Analysis Approach", Research Journal of Economics and Business Studies", Vol.5, No: 11, September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

"Preference" may also refer to non-choices, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Biology|biological]] explanations for one's preference. [[Sexual orientation]], for example, is no longer considered a sexual preference by most individuals, but is debatable based on philosophical and/or scientific ideas.

==Insolvency==
In Insolvency, the term can be used to describe when a company pays a specific creditor or group of creditors. From doing this, that creditor(s) is made better off, than other creditors. After paying the 'preferred creditor', the company seeks to go into a formal insolvency like an administration or liquidation.  There must be a desire to make the creditor better off, for them to be a preference. 
If the preference is proven, legal action can occur. It is a wrongful act of trading. Disqualification is a risk. &lt;ref name=Steven&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Keith|title=What Is A Preference Under The Insolvency Act 1986|url=https://www.companyrescue.co.uk/guides-knowledge/guides/what-is-a-preference-under-the-insolvency-act-1986-3748/|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''problem of other minds''' is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following [[Epistemology|epistemological]] challenge raised by the [[Skepticism|skeptic]]: given that I can only observe the [[behavior]] of others, how can I know that others have [[mind]]s?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/other-minds/|first=Alec|last=Hyslop|title=Other Minds|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|editor2-last=Nodelman|editor2-first=Uri|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University|issn=1095-5054|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a central tenet of the philosophical idea known as [[solipsism]]; the notion that for any person only one's own mind is known to exist. Solipsism maintains that no matter how sophisticated someone's behavior is, behavior on its own does not guarantee the presence of mentality.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''problem of religious language''' considers whether it is possible to talk about [[God]] meaningfully if the traditional conceptions of God as being incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, are accepted. Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God, religious language has the potential to be meaningless. Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless, or attempt to show how religious language can still be meaningful.

Traditionally, religious language has been explained as [[Apophatic theology|via negativa]], analogy, symbolism, or myth, each of which describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The ''via negativa'' is a way of referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise [[ineffability|ineffable]] experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.

Empiricist [[David Hume|David Hume's]] requirement that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] movement, particularly the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The movement proposed that, for a statement to hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically&amp;nbsp;– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued that he could not have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher [[Antony Flew]] proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.

The analogy of [[language-games|games]]&amp;nbsp;– most commonly associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein&amp;nbsp;– has been proposed as a way of establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem of meaning in religious language. [[R. M. Hare]] used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of "bliks"&amp;nbsp;– unfalsifiable [[belief-in|belief]]s according to which a worldview is established&amp;nbsp;– which are not necessarily meaningless. [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of [[eschatological verification]], the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.

==Problem of religious language==
Religious language is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises the problem of how (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all,{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=139–140}} which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1}} The French philosopher [[Simone Weil]] expressed this problem in her work ''Waiting for God'', in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1}}

The medieval doctrine of [[divine simplicity]] also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental properties]]&amp;nbsp;– these are properties that a being can have which do not contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the [[Bible]] regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the doctrine of divine simplicity.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1–2}}

The theologian [[Sallie McFague]] believes that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased [[secularism|secularisation]] of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both [[idolatry|idolatrous]] because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1–2}}

==Classical understanding of religious language==

===Via negativa===
[[File:Rambam-portrait.jpg|thumb|18th-century depiction of Maimonides, who developed the ''via negativa'']]

[[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]] [[Maimonides]] believed that God can only be ascribed negative attributes, a view based on two fundamental Jewish beliefs: that the existence of God must be accepted, and that it is forbidden to describe God.{{sfn|Levin|Schweid|2008|p=237}} Maimonides believed that God is [[divine simplicity|simple]] and so cannot be ascribed any essential attributes.{{sfn|Hyman|2008|p=400}} He therefore argued that statements about God must be taken negatively, for example, "God lives" should be taken as "God does not lack vitality".{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=88}} Maimonides did not believe that God holds all of his attributes perfectly and without impairment; rather, he proposed that God lies outside of any human measures. To say that God is powerful, for example, would mean that God's power is beyond worldly power, and incomparable to any other power. In doing so, Maimonides attempted to illustrate God's indescribable nature and draw attention to the linguistic limits of describing God.{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=89}}

===Analogy===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that statements about God are analogous to human experience.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} An analogous term is partly [[univocity|univocal]] (has only one meaning) and partly [[Equivocation|equivocal]] (has more than one potential meaning) because an analogy is in some ways the same and in some ways different from the subject.{{sfn|Cahalan|1985|p=438}} He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, it does not mean that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.{{sfn|Weed|2007}}

Philosopher [[Taede A. Smedes|Taede Smedes]] argued that religious language is symbolic.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}} Denying any conflict between science and religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, in the context of Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=41}} Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world that there can be no common standard to which both God and the world can be compared.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=43}} He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently).{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=45-46}} Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God ''pro nobis'' (for us) and not ''in se'' (as such) or ''sine nobis'' (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}}

In the twentieth century, [[Ian Ramsey]] developed the theory of analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by [[Alister McGrath]]. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation and the nature of God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God.{{sfn|McGrath|2011|loc=ch. 13}} The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.{{sfn|McGrath|1998|p=183}}

===Symbolism===
[[File:Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan.jpg|thumb|Sikh religious text, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan, in which religious language is used symbolically]]
Philosopher [[Paul Tillich]] argued that religious faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol points to a meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in the meaning of a concept.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=134}} Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality.{{sfn|Dourley|1975|p=85–6}} Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.{{sfn|Rees|2001|p=80}}

[[Louis Dupré (philosopher)|Louis Dupré]] differentiates between signs and symbols, proposing that a sign points to something while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: rather than merely pointing someone towards another object, it takes the place of and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1}} Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1–2}} A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=2}} Dupré differentiates between religious and [[aesthetic]] symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=6}}

[[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] explained religious language and experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.{{sfn|Pasewark|Pool|1999|p=103}}

In the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religious text the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], religious language is used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the [[religious experience|experiences]] they have while [[meditation|meditating]] are [[ineffability|ineffable]], incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous&amp;nbsp;– this means that there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=185}} To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=186}}

===Myth===
William Paden argued that religious language uses myth to present truths through stories. He argued that to those who practice a religion, myths are not mere fiction, but provide religious truths. Paden believed that a myth must explain something in the world with reference to a sacred being or force, and dismissed any myths which did not as "[[Folklore|folktale]]s".{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}} Using the example of [[creation myth]]s, he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses, the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth; a myth cannot be analysed in the same way as a scientific theory.{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}}

[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] proposed that the Bible contains [[existentialism|existential]] content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=81}} Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=82}} Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.{{sfn|Dray|2002|p=259}}

Christian philosopher John Hick believed that the language of the Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He offered a demythologised [[Christology]], arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the [[Son of God]] was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented.{{sfn|Mbogu|2008|p=117}} Hick believed that demythologising the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1987|p=7}}

==Alternative explanations of religious language==

===Political===
Islamic philosopher [[Carl Ernst]] has argued that religious language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=8}} Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=9}}

===Performative===
Peter Donovan argues that most religious language is not about making [[Truth claim|truth-claim]]s; instead, it is used to achieve certain goals.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=78}} He notes that language can be used in alternative ways beyond making statements of fact, such as expressing feelings or asking questions. Donovan calls many of these uses ''performative'', as they serve to perform a certain function within religious life. For example, the words "I promise" perform the action of promising themselves&amp;nbsp;– Donovan argues that most religious language fulfils this function.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=79–80}} Ludwig Wittgenstein also proposed that language could be performative and presented a list of the different uses of language. Wittgenstein argued that "the meaning of the language is in the use", taking the use of language to be performative.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=29}} The philosopher [[J. L. Austin]] argued that religious language is not just cognitive but can perform social acts, including vows, blessings, and the naming of children.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=26}} He distinguished performative statements as those that do not simply describe a state of affairs, but bring them about.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51}} Historian of religion Benjamin Ray uses the performance of rituals within religions as evidence for a performative interpretation of language. He argues that the language of rituals can perform social tasks: when a priest announces that a spiritual event has occurred, those present believe it because of the spiritual authority of the priest. He believed that the meaning of a ritual is defined by the language used by the speaker, who is defined culturally as a superhuman agent.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51–2}}

===Imperative===
British philosopher [[R. B. Braithwaite]] attempted to approach religious language [[empiricism|empirically]] and adopted Wittgenstein's idea of "meaning as use".{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=49}} He likened religious statements to moral statements because they are both non-descriptive yet still have a use and a meaning; they do not describe the world, but the believer's attitudes towards it. Braithwaite believed that the main difference between a religious and a moral statement was that religious statements are part of a linguistic system of stories, metaphors, and [[parable]]s.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=121}}

Professor [[Nathan Katz (professor)|Nathan Katz]] writes of the analogy of a burning building, used by the [[Buddha]] in the [[Lotus Sutra]], which casts religious language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children at the top of a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.{{sfn|Katz|1982|p=232}}

==Challenges to religious language==

===David Hume===
In the conclusion of his ''[[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience, and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}
{{Quote|Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact of existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.|David Hume|''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}}}
Hume criticised the view that we cannot speak about God, and proposed that this view is no different from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=171–2}}

===Logical positivism===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Alfred Jules Ayer.jpg|thumb|A. J. Ayer argued that religious language is meaningless because it is unverifiable.]] --&gt;
The [[logical positivism]] movement originated in the [[Vienna Circle]] and was continued by British philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The Vienna Circle adopted the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|distinction between analytic and synthetic statements]]: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}} To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a [[verifiability theory of meaning]], which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable.{{sfn|Weinberg|2001|p=1}} Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

In 1936, Ayer wrote ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', in which he claimed that religious language is meaningless.{{sfn|Attfield|2006|p=11}} He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be [[logical truth|necessarily true]], like mathematical statements.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}} In doing so, he rejected [[metaphysics]], which considers the reality of a world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless.{{sfn|Oppy|Scott|2010|p=8}} Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God&amp;nbsp;– theistic, atheistic and agnostic&amp;nbsp;– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein finished his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' with the proposition that "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Beverly and Brian Clack have suggested that because of this statement, Wittgenstein was taken for a positivist by many of his disciples because he made a distinction between what can and cannot be spoken about. They argue that this interpretation is inaccurate because Wittgenstein held the ''mystical'', which cannot be described, as important.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=110}} Rather than dismissing the mystical as meaningless, as the logical positivists did, Wittgenstein believed that while the facts of the world remain the same, the perspective from which they are viewed will vary.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=111}}

===Falsification===
The falsification principle has been developed as an alternative theory by which it may be possible to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is [[unfalsifiable]] because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Antony Flew]] argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement "God loves us" both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}}

Using [[John Wisdom]]'s [[Parable of the Invisible Gardener|parable of the invisible gardener]], Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable. The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island; one believes it is tended to by a gardener, the other believes that it formed naturally, without the existence of a gardener. The two watch out for the gardener but never find him; the non-believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener, whereas the believer rationalises the non-appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected.{{sfn|Lumsden|2009|p=44}} Flew contended that if the believer's interpretation is accepted, nothing is left of the original gardener. He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence; and these beliefs consequently suffer a "death by a thousand qualifications" as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=172}} Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God's love for humans, arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs. He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God, such as the terminal illness of a child, theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence; for example they may suggest that God's love is different from human love. Such qualifications, Flew argued, make the original proposition meaningless; he questioned what God's love actually promises and what it guarantees against, and proposed that God's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=283–284}}

Flew continued in many subsequent publications to maintain the falsifiability criterion for meaning; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable, and so meaningless.  Drawing specifically on the emerging science of [[molecular genetics]] (which had not existed at the time of his original paper), Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion "that there is no creator God" might be falsified;  "the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done."{{sfn|Flew|2007|p=124}}

==Analogies of games==
The analogy of a game was first proposed by [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] in an attempt to demonstrate the [[epistemology|epistemic]] unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=111}} Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; [[Christianity]] teaches this to be the [[logos (Christianity)|divine word]] which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Cooper|2006|p=217–218}}

Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a calculus theory of language, which maintained that all language should be analysable in a uniform way. Later in his life he rejected this theory, and instead proposed an alternative [[language-game]] analogy.{{sfn|Labron|2006|p=28}} He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games, arguing that just as there are many different games, each with different rules, so there are many different kinds of language.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}} Wittgenstein argued that different forms of language have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful; outside of its language-game, a proposition is meaningless. He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context.{{sfn|Glock|1996|p=192–193}} Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain kinds of language are used. He provided some examples of language games: "Asking, thanking, greeting, cursing, praying".{{sfn|Brenner|1999|p=16}}
{{quote|It is as if someone were to say: 'A game consists of moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules...'&amp;nbsp;– and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others.|Ludwig Wittgenstein|''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}}}}
Wittgenstein believed that religion is significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore believed that religious language is confessional&amp;nbsp;– a confession of what someone feels and believes&amp;nbsp;– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.{{sfn|Clack|1999|p=79}}

[[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips]] defended Wittgenstein's theory by arguing that although religious language games are autonomous, they should not be treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.{{sfn|Lacewing|Pascal|2007|p=173–4}}

Peter Donovan criticises the language-games approach for failing to recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=93}} Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the [[apologetics]] of some, demonstrates that they interact with each other and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=94–95}}

==Parables==

===R. M. Hare===
In response to Flew's falsification principle, British philosopher [[R. M. Hare]] told a parable in an attempt to demonstrate that religious language is meaningful. Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors want to kill him; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view. Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a "blik", and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable, yet still meaningful, worldview. He proposed that all people&amp;nbsp;– religious and non-religious&amp;nbsp;– hold bliks, and that they cannot be unseated by [[empirical evidence]]. Nevertheless, he maintained that a blik is meaningful because it forms the basis of a person's understanding of the world.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=173}} Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not, though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=37–38}}

===Basil Mitchell===
Basil Mitchell responded to Flew's falsification principle with his own parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, even if he is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=148}} Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views.{{sfn|Griffiths|Taliaferro|2003|p=108–109}} He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

===John Hick===
{{See also|Eschatological verification}}
Responding to the verification principle, [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to describe his theory of [[eschatological verificationism]]. His parable is of two travellers, a theist and an atheist, together on a road. The theist believes that there is a Celestial City at the end of the road; the atheist believes that there is no such city. Hick's parable is an allegory of the Christian belief in an afterlife, which he argued can be verified upon death.{{sfn|Polkinghorne|2003|p=145–146}} Hick believed that eschatological verification is "unsymmetrical" because while it could be verified if it is true, it cannot be falsified if not. This is in contrast to ordinary "symmetrical" statements, which can be verified or falsified.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=39}}

In his biography of Hick, David Cheetham notes a criticism of Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}} Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}}

James Morris notes that Hick's eschatological verification theory has been criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in [[religious pluralism]]. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in [[bodily resurrection]] can still be verified.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

'''''Projet de communauté philosophe''''' (translated as '''''Project for a Philosophical Community''''') is a book written by the [[French people|French]] philosopher [[Victor d'Hupay]], published in 1777.

== Review == 
This book can be seen as a cornerstone in the history of [[communism]], as it describes for the first time how "communists" (people living in a "[[commune]]") should understand this philosophy. 
In this work, the author advises to 'share all economic and material products between inhabitants of the "commune", so that all may benefit from everybody's work'.&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Cassely, 2016"&gt;Cassely, 2016 : ''Aix insolite et secrète'' JonGlez {{pp.|192-193}} ([http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb45058387v references from the Bibliothèque nationale de France])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Restif de la Bretonne]], a contemporary and friend of d'Hupay, thus describes him as a "communist" in a 1785 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hupay.fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191812/http://www.hupay.fr/ |archivedate=2017-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grandjonc Jacques, 1983"&gt;Grandjonc Jacques,1983: ''Quelques dates à propos des termes communiste et communisme'' In: Mots, n°7, Octobre 1983 {{p.|146}} ([http://www.persee.fr/doc/mots_0243-6450_1983_num_7_1_1122 reference on the Persée library])&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was partly written in d'Hupay's own [[bastide]] in [[Meyreuil]], near [[Aix-en-Provence]], where he was determined to set his own commune and live by the communist philosophy, with neighbours and friends.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hupay.fr/pages/vie-d-hupay.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional information ==
There is currently only one known public copy of this original edition, which is kept at the Diderot Library in [[Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/projet-de-communaute-philosophe/oclc/491640865&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''rationalism''' is the [[epistemology|epistemological]] view that "regards [[reason]] as the chief source and test of knowledge"&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism|title=Rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification".&lt;ref name="Lacey 286"&gt;Lacey, A.R. (1996), ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1st edition, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1976. 2nd edition, 1986. 3rd edition, Routledge, London, UK, 1996. p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, rationalism is defined as a [[methodology]] or a [[theory]] "in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and [[deductive]]".&lt;ref name="Bourke 263"&gt;Bourke, Vernon J., "Rationalism," p. 263 in Runes (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

In an old controversy, rationalism was opposed to [[empiricism]], where the rationalists believed that reality has an intrinsically logical structure. Because of this, the rationalists argued that certain truths exist and that the intellect can directly grasp these truths. That is to say, rationalists asserted that certain rational principles exist in [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[ethics]], and [[metaphysics]] that are so fundamentally true that denying them causes one to fall into contradiction. The rationalists had such a high confidence in reason that empirical proof and physical evidence were regarded as unnecessary to ascertain certain truths – in other words, "there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience".&lt;ref name="Rationalism vs. Empiricism"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/ Rationalism vs. Empiricism] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different degrees of emphasis on this method or theory lead to a range of rationalist standpoints, from the moderate position "that reason has precedence over other ways of acquiring knowledge" to the more extreme position that reason is "the unique path to knowledge".&lt;ref name="Audi 771"&gt;Audi, Robert, The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1995. 2nd edition, 1999, p. 771.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a pre-modern understanding of reason, rationalism is identical to [[philosophy]], the [[Socrates|Socratic]] life of inquiry, or the zetetic ([[Skepticism|skeptical]]) clear interpretation of authority (open to the underlying or essential cause of things as they appear to our sense of certainty). In recent decades, [[Leo Strauss]] sought to revive "Classical Political Rationalism" as a discipline that understands the task of reasoning, not as foundational, but as [[Maieutics|maieutic]].

In [[politics]], rationalism, since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], historically emphasized a "politics of reason" centered upon [[rational choice]], [[utilitarianism]], [[secularism]], and [[irreligion]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.isi.org/catalog/resource/view/id/678 Oakeshott, Michael,"Rationalism in Politics," ''The Cambridge Journal'' 1947, vol. 1] Retrieved 2013-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the latter aspect's [[antitheism]] was later softened by the adoption of pluralistic methods practicable regardless of religious or irreligious ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usj.sagepub.com/content/43/5-6/863.abstract Boyd, Richard, "The Value of Civility?," ''Urban Studies Journal'', May 2006, vol. 43 (no. 5–6), pp. 863–78] Retrieved 2013-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, the philosopher [[John Cottingham]]&lt;ref&gt;Cottingham, John. 1984. Rationalism. Paladi/Granada&lt;/ref&gt; noted how rationalism, a [[methodology]], became socially conflated with [[atheism]], a [[worldview]]:
{{quote|In the past, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, the term 'rationalist' was often used to refer to free thinkers of an anti-clerical and anti-religious outlook, and for a time the word acquired a distinctly pejorative force (thus in 1670 Sanderson spoke disparagingly of 'a mere rationalist, that is to say in plain English an atheist of the late edition...'). The use of the label 'rationalist' to characterize a world outlook which has no place for the supernatural is becoming less popular today; terms like '[[secular humanist|humanist]]' or '[[materialism|materialist]]' seem largely to have taken its place. But the old usage still survives.}}

==Philosophical usage==
Rationalism is often contrasted with [[empiricism]]. Taken very broadly these views are not mutually exclusive, since a philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist.&lt;ref name="Lacey 286"/&gt; Taken to extremes, the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'']], that is to say, through experience; either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification. The empiricist essentially believes that knowledge is based on or derived directly from experience. The rationalist believes we come to knowledge [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]&amp;nbsp;– through the use of logic&amp;nbsp;– and is thus independent of sensory experience. In other words, as [[Galen Strawson]] once wrote, "you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science."&lt;ref&gt;Sommers (2003), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Between both philosophies, the issue at hand is the fundamental source of human knowledge and the proper techniques for verifying what we think we know. Whereas both philosophies are under the umbrella of [[epistemology]], their argument lies in the understanding of the warrant, which is under the wider epistemic umbrella of the [[theory of justification]].

===Theory of justification===
{{Main|Theory of justification}}

The theory of justification is the part of [[epistemology]] that attempts to understand the justification of [[propositions]] and [[belief]]s. Epistemologists are concerned with various epistemic features of belief, which include the ideas of [[Formal proof|justification]], warrant, [[rationality]], and [[probability]]. Of these four terms, the term that has been most widely used and discussed by the early 21st century is "warrant". Loosely speaking, justification is the reason that someone (probably) holds a belief.

If "A" makes a claim, and "B" then casts doubt on it, "A"'s next move would normally be to provide justification. The precise method one uses to provide justification is where the lines are drawn between rationalism and empiricism (among other philosophical views). Much of the debate in these fields are focused on [[Philosophical analysis|analyzing]] the nature of knowledge and how it relates to connected notions such as [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[Formal proof|justification]].

===Thesis of rationalism===
At its core, rationalism consists of three basic claims. For one to consider themselves a rationalist, they must adopt at least one of these three claims: The Intuition/Deduction Thesis, The Innate Knowledge Thesis, or The Innate Concept Thesis. In addition, rationalists can choose to adopt the claims of Indispensability of Reason and or the Superiority of Reason – although one can be a rationalist without adopting either thesis.

====The Intuition/Deduction Thesis====

Rationale: ''"Some propositions in a particular subject area, S, are knowable by us by intuition alone; still others are knowable by being deduced from intuited propositions."''&lt;ref name="The Intuition/Deduction Thesis"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#2 The Intuition/Deduction Thesis] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, intuition is [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] knowledge or experiential belief characterized by its immediacy; a form of rational insight. We simply "see" something in such a way as to give us a warranted belief. Beyond that, the nature of intuition is hotly debated.

In the same way, generally speaking, deduction is the process of [[reasoning]] from one or more general [[premise]]s to reach a logically certain conclusion. Using valid [[argument]]s, we can deduce from intuited premises.

For example, when we combine both concepts, we can intuit that the number three is prime and that it is greater than two. We then deduce from this knowledge that there is a prime number greater than two. Thus, it can be said that intuition and deduction combined to provide us with ''a priori'' knowledge – we gained this knowledge independently of sense experience.

Empiricists such as [[David Hume]] have been willing to accept this thesis for describing the relationships among our own concepts.&lt;ref name="The Intuition/Deduction Thesis"/&gt; In this sense, empiricists argue that we are allowed to intuit and deduce truths from knowledge that has been obtained [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'']].

By injecting different subjects into the Intuition/Deduction thesis, we are able to generate different arguments. Most rationalists agree [[mathematics]] is knowable by applying the intuition and deduction. Some go further to include [[Ethics|ethical truths]] into the category of things knowable by intuition and deduction. Furthermore, some rationalists also claim [[metaphysics]] is knowable in this thesis.

In addition to different subjects, rationalists sometimes vary the strength of their claims by adjusting their understanding of the warrant. Some rationalists understand warranted beliefs to be beyond even the slightest doubt; others are more conservative and understand the warrant to be belief beyond a reasonable doubt.

Rationalists also have different understanding and claims involving the connection between intuition and truth. Some rationalists claim that intuition is infallible and that anything we intuit to be true is as such. More contemporary rationalists accept that intuition is not always a source of certain knowledge&amp;nbsp;– thus allowing for the possibility of a deceiver who might cause the rationalist to intuit a false proposition in the same way a third party could cause the rationalist to have perceptions of nonexistent objects.

Naturally, the more subjects the rationalists claim to be knowable by the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the more certain they are of their warranted beliefs, and the more strictly they adhere to the infallibility of intuition, the more controversial their truths or claims and the more radical their rationalism.&lt;ref name="The Intuition/Deduction Thesis"/&gt;

To argue in favor of this thesis, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], a prominent German philosopher, says, "The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened before will happen in the same way again. … From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to us to think of them…"&lt;ref&gt;1704, Gottfried Leibniz Preface, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Innate Knowledge Thesis====
Rationale: ''"We have knowledge of some truths in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational nature."''&lt;ref name="The Innate Knowledge Thesis"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#3 The Innate Knowledge Thesis] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Innate Knowledge thesis is similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim [[knowledge]] is gained [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.

This thesis targets a problem with the nature of inquiry originally postulated by [[Plato]] in ''[[Meno]]''. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do we gain knowledge of a theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by inquiry seems impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Meno, 80d–e&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "If we already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack the knowledge, we don't know what we are seeking and cannot recognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems."&lt;ref name="The Innate Knowledge Thesis"/&gt; The Innate Knowledge thesis offers a solution to this [[paradox]]. By claiming that knowledge is already with us, either [[Consciousness|consciously]] or [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], a rationalist claims we don't really "learn" things in the traditional usage of the word, but rather that we simply bring to light what we already know.

====The Innate Concept Thesis====
Rationale: ''"We have some of the concepts we employ in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational nature."''&lt;ref name="The Innate Concept Thesis"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#4 The Innate Concept Thesis] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Innate Knowledge thesis, the Innate Concept thesis suggests that some concepts are simply part of our rational nature. These concepts are [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] in nature and sense experience is irrelevant to determining the nature of these concepts (though, sense experience can help bring the concepts to our [[Consciousness|conscious mind]]).

Some philosophers, such as [[John Locke]] (who is considered one of the most influential thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and an [[Empiricism|empiricist]]) argue that the Innate Knowledge thesis and the Innate Concept thesis are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, Concerning Human Understanding, Book I, Ch. III, par. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers, such as [[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]], argue that the two theses are distinct from one another. As with the other theses covered under the umbrella of rationalism, the more types and greater number of concepts a philosopher claims to be innate, the more controversial and radical their position; "the more a concept seems removed from experience and the mental operations we can perform on experience the more plausibly it may be claimed to be innate. Since we do not experience perfect triangles but do experience pains, our concept of the former is a more promising candidate for being innate than our concept of the latter.&lt;ref name="The Innate Concept Thesis"/&gt;

In his book, ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yMwiTTpwasgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor1-first= J. |editor1-last=Cottingham |date=April 1996 |origyear= 1986 |edition= revised |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-55818-1 |title= Meditations on First Philosophy With Selections from the Objections and Replies }}&amp;nbsp;–The original ''Meditations'', translated, in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] postulates three classifications for our [[idea]]s when he says, "Among my ideas, some appear to be innate, some to be adventitious, and others to have been invented by me. My understanding of what a thing is, what truth is, and what thought is, seems to derive simply from my own nature. But my hearing a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or feeling the fire, comes from things which are located outside me, or so I have hitherto judged. Lastly, [[siren (mythology)|siren]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[hippogriff]]s and the like are my own invention."&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes AT VII 37–8; CSM II 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Adventitious ideas are those concepts that we gain through sense experiences, ideas such as the sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and something you simply cannot [[Will (philosophy)|will]] away. Ideas invented by us, such as those found in [[mythology]], [[legend]]s, and [[fairy tale]]s are created by us from other ideas we possess. Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of [[perfection]], are those ideas we have as a result of mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] defends the idea of innate concepts by suggesting the mind plays a role in determining the nature of concepts, to explain this, he likens the mind to a block of marble in the ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'', "This is why I have taken as an illustration a block of veined marble, rather than a wholly uniform block or blank tablets, that is to say what is called tabula rasa in the language of the philosophers. For if the soul were like those blank tablets, truths would be in us in the same way as the figure of Hercules is in a block of marble, when the marble is completely indifferent whether it receives this or some other figure. But if there were veins in the stone which marked out the figure of Hercules rather than other figures, this stone would be more determined thereto, and Hercules would be as it were in some manner innate in it, although labour would be needed to uncover the veins, and to clear them by polishing, and by cutting away what prevents them from appearing. It is in this way that ideas and truths are innate in us, like natural inclinations and dispositions, natural habits or potentialities, and not like activities, although these potentialities are always accompanied by some activities which correspond to them, though they are often imperceptible."&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1704, New Essays on human Understanding, Preface, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

====The other two theses====
The three aforementioned theses of Intuition/Deduction, Innate Knowledge, and Innate Concept are the cornerstones of rationalism. To be considered a rationalist, one must adopt at least one of those three claims. The following two theses are traditionally adopted by rationalists, but they aren't essential to the rationalist's position.

'''The Indispensability of Reason Thesis''' has the following rationale, "The knowledge we gain in subject area, ''S'', by intuition and deduction, as well as the ideas and instances of knowledge in ''S'' that are innate to us, could not have been gained by us through sense experience."&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"/&gt; In short, this thesis claims that experience cannot provide what we gain from reason.

'''The Superiority of Reason Thesis''' has the following rationale, '"The knowledge we gain in subject area ''S'' by intuition and deduction or have innately is superior to any knowledge gained by sense experience".&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"/&gt; In other words, this thesis claims reason is superior to experience as a source for knowledge.

In addition to the following claims, rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]. Naturally, when you claim some truths are innately known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this [[foundational knowledge]] to know more truths.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"/&gt;

==Background==
Rationalism - as an appeal to human reason as a way of obtaining knowledge - has a philosophical history dating from antiquity. The [[analytic philosophy|analytical]] nature of much of philosophical enquiry, the awareness of apparently [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] domains of knowledge such as mathematics, combined with the emphasis of obtaining knowledge through the use of rational faculties (commonly rejecting, for example, direct [[revelation]]) have made rationalist themes very prevalent in the history of philosophy.

Since the Enlightenment, rationalism is usually associated with the introduction of mathematical methods into philosophy as seen in the works of [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Bourke 263"/&gt; This is commonly called '''continental rationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, because it was predominant in the continental schools of Europe, whereas in Britain [[empiricism]] dominated.

Even then, the distinction between rationalists and empiricists was drawn at a later period and would not have been recognized by the philosophers involved. Also, the distinction between the two philosophies is not as clear-cut as is sometimes suggested; for example, Descartes and Locke have similar views about the nature of human ideas.&lt;ref name="Rationalism vs. Empiricism"/&gt;

Proponents of some varieties of rationalism argue that, starting with foundational basic principles, like the axioms of [[geometry]], one could [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] derive the rest of all possible knowledge. The philosophers who held this view most clearly were [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], whose attempts to grapple with the epistemological and metaphysical problems raised by Descartes led to a development of the fundamental approach of rationalism. Both Spinoza and Leibniz asserted that, ''in principle'', all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, could be gained through the use of reason alone, though they both observed that this was not possible ''in practice'' for human beings except in specific areas such as [[mathematics]]. On the other hand, Leibniz admitted in his book ''[[Monadology]]'' that "we are all mere [[Empirics]] in three fourths of our actions."&lt;ref name="Audi 771"/&gt;

==History==
===Rationalist philosophy from antiquity===
Although rationalism in its modern form post-dates antiquity, philosophers from this time laid down the foundations of rationalism. {{Cn|date=April 2018}} In particular, the understanding that we may be aware of knowledge available only through the use of rational thought. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

====Ajita Kesakambali (600 BCE)====
[[Ajita Kesakambali]] was an ancient [[Indian people|Indian]] philosopher in the 6th century BCE. He is considered to be the first known proponent of Indian materialism, and forerunner to the [[Charvaka]] school of Indian thought, which holds [[direct perception]], [[empiricism]], and conditional [[inference]] as proper sources of knowledge, embraces [[philosophical skepticism]] and rejects Vedas, [[Vedic ritualism]], and [[supernaturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govind-pansare-mm-kalburgi-gauri-lankesh-murder-5316465/|title=Indian rationalism, Charvaka to Narendra Dabholkar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pythagoras (570–495 BCE)====
{{Main|Pythagoras}}
Pythagoras was one of the first Western philosophers to stress rationalist insight.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism/68592/History-of-rationalism|title=Rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often revered as a great [[mathematician]], [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[scientist]], but he is best known for the [[Pythagorean theorem]], which bears his name, and for discovering the mathematical relationship between the length of strings on lute and the pitches of the notes. Pythagoras "believed these harmonies reflected the ultimate nature of reality. He summed up the implied metaphysical rationalism in the words "All is number". It is probable that he had caught the rationalist's vision, later seen by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1564–1642), of a world governed throughout by mathematically formulable laws".&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"/&gt; It has been said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8–9 = [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli, [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58. Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97–102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plato (427–347 BCE)====
{{Main|Plato}}
Plato held rational insight to a very high standard, as is seen in his works such as [[Meno]] and [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]. He taught on the [[Theory of Forms]] (or the Theory of Ideas)&lt;ref&gt;Modern English textbooks and translations prefer "theory of Form" to "theory of Ideas," but the latter has a long and respected tradition starting with Cicero and continuing in German philosophy until present, and some English philosophers prefer this in English too. See W D Ross, Plato's Theory of Ideas (1951) and [http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php this] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061811/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php |date=2011-09-27 }} reference site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not modern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. The term was used at least as early as [[Diogenes Laertius]], who called it (Plato's) "Theory of Forms:" {{lang|grc|Πλάτων ἐν τῇ περὶ τῶν ἰδεῶν ὑπολήψει}}...., {{cite encyclopedia | title=Plato | encyclopedia=Lives of Eminent Philosophers | volume=Book III | pages=Paragraph 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato uses many different words for what is traditionally called ''form'' in English translations and ''idea'' in German and Latin translations (Cicero). These include ''idéa'', ''morphē'', ''eîdos'', and ''parádeigma'', but also ''génos'', ''phýsis'', and ''[[Ousia|ousía]]''. He also uses expressions such as ''to x auto'', "the x itself" or ''kath' auto'' "in itself." See Christian Schäfer: ''Idee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen'', in ''Platon-Lexikon'', Darmstadt 2007, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; which asserts that the highest and most fundamental kind of reality is not the material world of change [[allegory of the cave|known to us through sensation]],  but rather the abstract, non-material  (but [[Ousia|substantial]]) world of forms (or ideas).&lt;ref&gt;''Forms (usually given a capital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material abstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely real, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by 'participating' in them.'' [http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php Plato's theory of forms (or ideas)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061811/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato, these forms were accessible only to reason and not to sense.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"/&gt; In fact, it is said that Plato admired reason, especially in [[geometry]], so highly that he had the phrase "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter" inscribed over the door to his academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato-dialogues.org/faq/faq009.htm|title=Plato FAQ: "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter"|first=Bernard F.|last=SUZANNE|website=plato-dialogues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aristotle (384–322 BCE)====
{{Main|Aristotle}}
[[Aristotle]]'s main contribution to rationalist thinking was the use of [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic and its use in argument. Aristotle defines syllogism as "a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Prior Analytics'', 24b18–20&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this very general definition, Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms which consist of three [[categorical proposition]]s in his work ''[[Prior Analytics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#SynSemSen] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Ancient Logic'' Aristotle Non-Modal Syllogistic&lt;/ref&gt; These included categorical [[modal logic|modal]] syllogisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#ModLog] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Ancient Logic'' Aristotle Modal Logic&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-Aristotle====
Although the three great Greek philosophers disagreed with one another on specific points, they all agreed that rational thought could bring to light knowledge that was self-evident – information that humans otherwise couldn't know without the use of reason. After Aristotle's death, Western rationalistic thought was generally characterized by its application to theology, such as in the works of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], the Islamic philosopher [[Avicenna]] and Jewish philosopher and theologian [[Maimonides]]. One notable event in the Western timeline was the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] who attempted to merge Greek rationalism and Christian revelation in the thirteenth-century.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"/&gt;

===Classical rationalism===
Early modern rationalism has its roots in the 17th-century [[Dutch Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;Lavaert, Sonja; Schröder, Winfried: ''The Dutch Legacy: Radical Thinkers of the 17th Century and the Enlightenment''. (BRILL, 2016, {{ISBN|978-9004332072}})&lt;/ref&gt; with some notable intellectual representatives like [[Hugo Grotius]],&lt;ref&gt;Berolzheimer, Fritz: ''The World's Legal Philosophies''. Translated by Rachel Szold. (New York: The MacMillan Co., 1929. lv, 490 pp. Reprinted 2002 by The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd). As [[Fritz Berolzheimer]] noted, "As the Cartesian "cogito ergo sum" became the point of departure of rationalistic philosophy, so the establishment of government and law upon reason made Hugo Grotius the founder of an independent and purely rationalistic system of [[natural law]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]], and [[Baruch Spinoza]].

====René Descartes (1596–1650)====
{{Main|René Descartes}}
Descartes was the first of the modern rationalists and has been dubbed the 'Father of Modern Philosophy.' Much subsequent [[Western philosophy]] is a response to his writings,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA516 ''History of western philosophy''] pp. 511, 516–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger [1938] (2002) p. 76 "Descartes... that which he himself founded... modern (and that means, at the same time, Western) metaphysics."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Richard A. |last1=Watson |authorlink1=Richard Watson (philosopher) |title=René Descartes |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc |date=31 March 2012 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/158787/Rene-Descartes |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are studied closely to this day.

Descartes thought that only knowledge of eternal truths{{spaced ndash}} including the truths of mathematics, and the epistemological and metaphysical foundations of the sciences{{spaced ndash}} could be attained by reason alone; other knowledge, the knowledge of physics, required experience of the world, aided by the [[scientific method]]. He also argued that although [[dream]]s appear as real as [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], these dreams cannot provide persons with knowledge. Also, since conscious sense experience can be the cause of illusions, then sense experience itself can be doubtable. As a result, Descartes deduced that a rational pursuit of truth should doubt every belief about sensory reality. He elaborated these beliefs in such works as ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''. Descartes developed a method to attain truths according to which nothing that cannot be recognised by the intellect (or [[reason]]) can be classified as knowledge. These truths are gained "without any sensory experience," according to Descartes. Truths that are attained by reason are broken down into elements that intuition can grasp, which, through a purely deductive process, will result in clear truths about reality.

Descartes therefore argued, as a result of his method, that reason alone determined knowledge, and that this could be done independently of the senses. For instance, his famous dictum, ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' or "I think, therefore I am", is a conclusion reached ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' i.e., prior to any kind of experience on the matter. The simple meaning is that doubting one's existence, in and of itself, proves that an "I" exists to do the thinking. In other words, doubting one's own doubting is absurd.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in modern philosophies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism/68594/Epistemological-rationalism-in-modern-philosophies|title=Rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was, for Descartes, an irrefutable principle upon which to ground all forms of other knowledge. Descartes posited a metaphysical [[Cartesian dualism|dualism]], distinguishing between the substances of the human body ("''res extensa''") and the [[mind]] or soul ("''res cogitans''"). This crucial distinction would be left unresolved and lead to what is known as the [[mind-body problem]], since the two substances in the Cartesian system are independent of each other and irreducible.

====Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716)====
{{Main|Gottfried Leibniz}}
Leibniz was the last of the great Rationalists who contributed heavily to other fields such as [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[jurisprudence]], and the [[philosophy of religion]]; he is also considered to be one of the last "universal geniuses".&lt;ref name="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz "&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz].&lt;/ref&gt; He did not develop his system, however, independently of these advances. Leibniz rejected Cartesian dualism and denied the existence of a material world. In Leibniz's view there are infinitely many simple substances, which he called "[[Monadology|monads]]" (possibly taking the term from the work of [[Anne Conway, Viscountess Conway|Anne Conway]]).

Leibniz developed his theory of monads in response to both Descartes and [[Spinoza]], because the rejection of their visions forced him to arrive at his own solution. Monads are the fundamental unit of reality, according to Leibniz, constituting both inanimate and animate objects. These units of reality represent the universe, though they are not subject to the laws of causality or space (which he called "[[well-founded phenomenon|well-founded phenomena]]"). Leibniz, therefore, introduced his principle of [[pre-established harmony]] to account for apparent causality in the world.

====Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)====
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
Kant is one of the central figures of modern [[philosophy]], and set the terms by which all subsequent thinkers have had to grapple. He argued that human perception structures natural laws, and that reason is the source of morality. His thought continues to hold a major influence in contemporary thought, especially in fields such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/ |title=Immanuel Kant (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant named his brand of epistemology "[[Transcendental Idealism]]", and he first laid out these views in his famous work ''[[Critique of Pure Reason|The Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it he argued that there were fundamental problems with both rationalist and empiricist dogma. To the rationalists he argued, broadly, that pure reason is flawed when it goes beyond its limits and claims to know those things that are necessarily beyond the realm of all possible experience: the [[existence of God]], free will, and the immortality of the human soul. Kant referred to these objects as "The Thing in Itself" and goes on to argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by definition means we cannot know them. To the empiricist he argued that while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into coherent thought. He therefore concludes that both reason and experience are necessary for human knowledge. In the same way, Kant also argued that it was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis. "In Kant's views, [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] concepts do exist, but if they are to lead to the amplification of knowledge, they must be brought into relation with empirical data".&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/rationalism.html Excerpt from the Encyclopædia Britannica]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary rationalism===
Rationalism has become a rarer label ''tout court'' of philosophers today; rather many different kinds of specialised rationalisms are identified. For example, [[Robert Brandom]] has appropriated the terms [[rationalist expressivism]] and [[rationalist pragmatism]] as labels for aspects of his programme in ''Articulating Reasons'', and identified [[linguistic rationalism]], the claim that the content of propositions "are essentially what can serve as both premises and conclusions of inferences", as a key thesis of [[Wilfred Sellars]].&lt;ref&gt;''Articulating reasons'', 2000. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
Rationalism was criticized by [[William James]] for being out of touch with reality. James also criticized rationalism for representing the universe as a closed system, which contrasts to his view that the universe is an open system.&lt;ref name="pragmatism"&gt;{{cite speech|last=James|first=William|date=November 1906|location=Lowell Institute|title=The Present Dilemma in Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18886">'''Reflectivism''' is a broad [[Umbrella term|umbrella label]], used primarily in [[International relations theory|International Relations theory]], for a range of theoretical approaches which oppose [[Rational choice|rational-choice]] accounts of social phenomena and, perhaps, [[positivism]] more generally.  The label was popularised by [[Robert Keohane]] in his presidential address to the [[International Studies Association]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;The attribution to Keohane is standard -- see e.g. Milja Kurki, ''Causation in International Relations: Reclaiming Causal Analysis''.  Cambridge University Press (2008), p. 124 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The address was entitled "International Institutions: Two Approaches", and contrasted two broad approaches to the study of [[international institution]]s (and international phenomena more generally).  One was "rationalism", the other what Keohane referred to as "reflectivism".  Rationalists — including [[Realism (international relations)|realists]], [[Neorealism (international relations)|neo-realists]], [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberals]], [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neo-liberals]], and scholars using [[Game theory|game-theoretic]] or [[Expected utility|expected-utility]] [[Economic model|models]] — are theorists who adopt the broad theoretical and [[ontological]] commitments of [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice theory]].

== Rationalism vs. reflectivism ==
Keohane characterised rationalism in the following fashion:

:[Rationalists accept] what [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] has referred to a "substantive" conception of rationality, characterizing "behaviour that can be adjudged objectively to be [[Optimal decision|optimally]] adapted to the situation" (Simon, 1985:294).  As Simon has argued, the principle of [[Decision-making models#Rationality|substantive rationality]] generates hypotheses about actual human behaviour only when it is combined with certain [[Duhem–Quine thesis|auxiliary]] [[Scientific theory#Assumptions in formulating theories|assumptions]] about the structure of [[utility function]]s and the formation of expectations.

:Since this research program is rooted in [[exchange theory]], it assumes [[scarcity]] and competition as well as [[rationality]] on the part of the actors.  Rationalistic theories of [[institution]]s view institutions as affecting patterns of [[Cost#Comparing private, external, social, and psychic costs|costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Keohane, "International Institutions: Two Approaches", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 32, 4 (Dec. 1988), pp. 381, 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keohane went on to contrast this with the approach of "reflective" scholars:
:These authors, of whom the best-known include [[Hayward Alker]], [[Richard K. Ashley|Richard Ashley]], [[Friedrich Kratochwil]], and [[John Ruggie]], emphasize the importance of the "[[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] meanings" of international institutional activity (Kratochwil and Ruggie, 1986:765).  In their view, understanding how people think about institutional [[Social norms|norms]] and rules, and the [[discourse]] they engage in, is as important in evaluating the significance of these norms as measuring the behavior that changes in response to their invocation.

:These writers emphasize that individuals, local organizations, and even states develop within the context of more encompassing institutions.  Institutions do not merely reflect the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] and power of the units constituting them; the institutions themselves shape those preferences and that power.  Institutions are therefore constitutive of actors as well as vice versa.  It is therefore not sufficient in this view to treat the preferences of individuals as given [[exogenous]]ly: they are affected by institutional arrangements, by prevailing norms, and by historically contingent discourse among people seeking to pursue their purposes and solve their self-defined problems.

:[I]t would be fair to refer to them as "[[Verstehen|interpretive]]" scholars, since they all emphasize the importance of historical and textual interpretation and the limitations of [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] in studying world politics. But other approaches also have a right to be considered [[Antipositivism|interpretive]]. I have therefore coined a phrase for these writers, calling them "reflective", since all of them emphasize the importance of human reflection for the nature of institutions and ultimately for the character of world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Keohane, "International Institutions", pp. 381-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflectivism and rationalism are typically used as labels applying not just to the study of international institutions, but of international relations more widely, and even the social world as a whole.  Sociologies and histories of the International Relations discipline have sometimes used the opposition between these approaches to describe one of the central fault-lines within the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ole Waever, "The Rise and Fall of the Inter-Paradigm Debate", in Steve Smith, Ken Booth and Marysia Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond''.  Cambridge University Press (1996), pp. 164-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflexivity ==
There may be another sense, not specifically discussed by Keohane, in which the label is apt. Reflectivist scholars tend to emphasise the inherent [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] both of theory and of the social world it studies.  Unlike the term ''reflectivism'', the concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|"reflexivity"]] has wide currency outside of international relations, having come to prominence in [[social theory]] in the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Prominent early works in social theory developing the theme of reflexivity include Anthony Giddens, ''The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration''.  Polity (1984); [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and Loïc Wacquant, ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''.  University of Chicago Press (1992); and Ulrich Beck, ''Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity''.  SAGE (1992 [1986]).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflexivity refers to the ways in which elements and phenomena in social life have the capacity to "fold in on", or be "directed towards", themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Similar imagery is used by Matthew Eagleton-Pierce, "Examining the Case for Reflexivity in International Relations: Insights from Bourdieu", ''Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies'' 1 (2009), p. 111–12.  Another explicit analysis of reflexivity in IR, also inspired by the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu, is Anna Leander, "Do We Really Need Reflexivity in IPE? Bourdieu's Two Reasons for Answering Affirmatively", ''Review of International Political Economy'' 9, 4 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they can produce effects on, or have implications for, their own features, dynamics and existence. An example is the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" (or "self-disconfirming prophecy")&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ido Oren, "Can Political Science Emulate the Natural Sciences? The Problem of Self-Disconfirming Analysis", ''Polity'' 38, 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; — a situation in which merely describing, predicting, imagining or believing something to be the case may eventually result in its actually coming to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;In IR, see e.g. David Patrick Houghton, "The Role of Self-Fulfilling and Self-Negating Prophecies in International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 11, 3 (2009); Robert Jervis, ''System Effects: Complexity in Political and Social Life''.  Princeton University Press (1997), pp. 60, 148–50.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, reflectivists emphasise the significance of human [[self-awareness]]: the ways people observe, imagine, describe, predict and theorise about themselves and the social reality around them, and the [[wikt:recursive|recursive]] effect this "self-knowledge" or these "reflections" have on that social reality itself.  Some scholars link reflexivity with [[Structure and agency|the broader debate]], within International Relations theory and social theory more generally, over the relationship between "[[Agency (sociology)|agency]]" and "[[Social structure|structure]]" in the social world.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Kate O'Neill, Jörg Balsiger and Stacy VanDeveer, "Actors, Norms and Impact: Recent International Cooperation Theory and the Influence of the Agent-Structure Debate", ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 7 (2004); Alexander Wendt, "The Agent-Structure Problem in International Relations Theory", ''International Organization'' 41, 3 (1987), p. 359; Daniel Mügge, "Reflexivity in Global Finance: How Agency Matters to Market Change", GARNET Working Paper #14/07 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the relationship between people's capacity to "freely" choose their actions and/or to "make a real difference" to the world around them, and the social "[[Social structure|structures]]" in which people are always embedded, and which may powerfully shape – often against their will or in ways they are unaware of – the kinds of things they are able to do.

Reflectivists also often claim that studying and ''theorising'' about international relations can be, should be, and are necessarily, reflexive. For one thing, they claim, theories about social reality may affect – might change – social reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;A point emphasised, among many others, by Brent J. Steele, ''Ontological Security in International Relations: Self-Identity and the IR State''.  Routledge (2008), pp. 150, 160-64 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of (neo-)realism have raised the possibility that realist theories, for instance, may act as [[Self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].  To the extent that they are taken by theorists and practitioners to be the "common sense" of international politics, diplomacy and policy-making, those theories may encourage precisely the kind of mistrust, ruthless competition and amorality that they posit to be natural and inherent features of the international realm.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Annette Freyburg-Inan, ''What Moves Man: The Realist Theory of International Relations and Its Judgment of Human Nature''. SUNY Press (2003); Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics''.  Cambridge University Press (1999), pp. 368-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar methodological examples of the capacity of observation and theorising to affect the object/phenomena of study include the "[[observer-expectancy effect]]" and long-running concerns among anthropologists and ethnographers over the possible effect of [[Participant observer#Impact of researcher involvement|participant observation]] on the very people and behaviours being studied.

Furthermore, reflectivists argue, those theories invariably reflect in important ways the social context in which they were produced; so in a sense the social world shapes the theories made of it.&lt;ref&gt;One detailed empirical study is Ido Oren, ''Our Enemies and Us: America's Rivalries and the Making of Political Science''.  Cornell UP (2003); see also Oren, "Is Culture Independent of National Security? How America's National Security Concerns Shaped 'Political Culture' Research", ''European Journal of International Relations'' 6, 4 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a [[normative]] or ethical aspect to the emphasis on reflexivity.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Brooke Ackerly and Jacqui True, "Reflexivity in Practice: Power and Ethics in Feminist Research on International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 10, 4 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflectivists often argue that theorists should be as self-aware as possible — to reflect as much as possible on the influences ([[Presupposition|assumptions]], [[bias]]es, normative commitments, etc.) that feed into and shape the theories they produce.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Mark Neufeld, "Reflexivity and International Relations Theory", ''Millennium'' 22, 1 (1993), p. 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they should be able to [[Reflexivity (social theory)#Overview|hold their own theories]] to the standards and arguments they set out in those same theories.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Inanna Hamati-Ataya, "The 'Problem of Values' and International Relations Scholarship: From Applied Reflexivity to Reflexivism", ''International Studies Review'' 13, 2 (2011); Christian Büger, "Paradigms, Cultures and Translations: Seven Ways of Studying the Discipline of International Relations", paper presented at the Annual Convention of the International Studies Association, Chicago (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, they should reflect on the likely and possible effects of their theorising.  Some reflectivists (e.g. those of a [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralist]] persuasion) have argued that theorising should itself be understood as a [[Practice (social theory)|practice]], like the human practices that theories study; that it is an act (conscious or unconscious) of intervention into social reality, and that as such it is never "innocent" or "neutral", and there is a degree of responsibility for its consequences that theorists cannot (and should not try to) escape.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Marysia Zalewski, "'All These Theories yet the Bodies Keep Piling Up': Theories, Theorists, Theorising", in Smith, Booth and Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond'', pp. 340-53; Steve Smith, "Singing Our World into Existence: International Relations Theory and September 11", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 48, 3 (2004); Jack Amoureux and Brent Steele, ''Reflexivity and International Relations''. Routledge Press (2016); Jack Amoureux, ''A Practice of Ethics for Global Politics: Ethical Reflexivity''. Routledge Press (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflectivism and post-positivism ==
Reflectivist approaches include such approaches as [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], [[Feminist theory|feminism]], [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralism]], [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] and [[Critical Theory]].  The challenge launched by these approaches against rationalist approaches, which have largely dominated the IR discipline for the past three decades, was linked to the "Third Debate in International Relations"&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Lapid, "The Third Debate: On the Prospects of International Theory in a Post-Positivist Era", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 33, 3 (Sept. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Positivism|positivists]] and [[Postpositivism|post-positivists]]/[[Antipositivism|anti-positivists]]. (The first two disciplinary "Great Debates" are supposed to have pitted (1) [[Realism (international relations)|realists]] vs. so-called "[[Idealism in international relations theory|idealists]]", and (2) [[Behavioralism|behaviouralists]] vs. so-called "traditionalists", the latter favouring historical methods and insights from [[political philosophy]].) Although the large majority of reflectivists oppose [[Positivism#Positivism in science today|positivism]], it might be a mistake to equate reflectivism with post-positivism or anti-positivism, as [[Constructivism (international relations)#Recent developments|(conventional) constructivists]] who are positivist in orientation would nevertheless fall under Keohane's description.  Confusion may be compounded by the fact that in International Relations theory, rationalism&lt;ref&gt;On which, see e.g. Miles Kahler, "Rationality in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and positivism can often be (erroneously) equated.&lt;ref&gt;That positivism and rationalism are not synonymous is noted e.g. by Milja Kurki and Colin Wight, "International Relations and Social Science", in Timothy Dunne, Milja Kurki and Steve Smith (eds.), ''International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity''.  Oxford University Press (2007), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many positivist political scientists who do not adopt [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice]] assumptions.

Some mainstream International Relations scholars, dismissing the importance or value of non-positivist approaches to social science, have reframed the rationalism-reflectivism debate narrowly, as a debate between [[Rationalist-constructivist debate|rationalism and ("conventional") constructivism]], construed as the two major [[Social theory|social theories]] (or "[[Ontology|ontologies]]") of (mainstream) International Relations theory. The rationalism-constructivism debate drew considerable attention within the mainstream at the turn of the 21st century, with some rejecting the starkness of the opposition itself and asserting a fundamental compatibility, or possibility of synthesis, between the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. James Fearon and Alexander Wendt, "Rationalism v. Constructivism: A Skeptical View", in Walter Carlsnaes, Thomas Risse and Beth Simmons (eds.), ''Handbook of International Relations'', 1st edn. SAGE (2002), pp. 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of reflectivist approaches==
The main criticisms of reflectivist approaches stem from the [[epistemology|epistemological]] differences between reflectivism and what in the social sciences has come to be known as [[positivism]]. Since the 1970s, mainstream International Relations theory has become increasingly, and more insistently, positivist in epistemological orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Maliniak, Amy Oakes, Susan Peterson and Michael J. Tierney, "The International Relations Discipline, 1980-2006", paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Chicago (2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical reflectivist rejection of positivist assumptions and methods has led to criticism that the approach cannot make reliable statements about the outside world and even that it has repudiated the entire "social science enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;In reference to "postmodernism", for example, see Peter Katzenstein, Robert Keohane and Stephen Krasner, "International Organization at Fifty: Exploration and Contestation in the Study of World Politics", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms are widespread in American political science, and reflectivism is not generally popular in U.S.-based IR scholarship, especially when compared with scholarship originating in Europe and the third world.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ole Waever, "The Sociology of a Not So International Discipline:  American and European Developments in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (1998); Thomas Biersteker, "The Parochialism of Hegemony:  Challenges for 'American' International Relations", in Arlene Tickner and Ole Waever (eds.), ''International Relations Scholarship Around the World:  Worlding Beyond the West''.  Routledge (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transactionalism''' is a philosophical approach that addresses the fundamental nature of social exchange or human transaction; that all human exchange is best understood as a set of transactions within a reciprocal and co-constitutive whole. A transactionalist demands that all human exchange, including learning,&lt;ref name="Kolb"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpbeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA390&amp;dq=transactionalism+zoology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_heb31M_UAhUX3mMKHb2wDMsQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=interaction%20and%20transaction&amp;f=false|title=Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development|last=Kolb|first=David A.|date=2014-12-17|publisher=FT Press|isbn=9780133892505|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is best understood as a transactional whole shaped and defined by a set of experiences in an ecology that are all-at-once biological, socio-linguistic, and intellectual; "man is an information-processing, organizing, open-energy system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study (paperback)|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2017-03-18|publisher=Independently published|year=|isbn=9781520829319|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=99|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attention must be paid to organizing acts within, and as-if always, a reciprocal and co-constitutive, exchange whether it be in buying and selling, teaching and learning, in a marital contract, or a social situation in-person or online.

== Definition ==
Stemming from the Latin ''transigere'' ("˜to drive through", "to accomplish"), the root word "transaction" is not restricted to the economic sense of ''buying and selling'' or merely a [[financial transaction]]. A much larger field of exchange is employed such as, "any sort of social interaction, such as verbal communication, eye contact, or touch. A 'stroke' [of one's hand] is an act of recognition of a transaction" as employed in psychology with [[transactional analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.disorders.org/relationships/transactional-analysis/|title=Transactional Analysis|work=Disorders.org - Find Therapists, Counselors, and Treatment Centers|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It not only examines exchanges, or "transactions," between borrower and lender, but encompasses any transaction involving people and objects whether it involves "borrowing-lending, buying-selling, writing-reading, parent-child, and husband-wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|page=|pages=33|language=English|chapter=Transactionalism Viewed Historically|orig-year=1969|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [https://www.influenceecology.com/distinctionary/transaction/ transaction], then is "a creative act, engaged in by one who, by virtue of his participation in the act – of which he is always an ''aspect'', never an ''entity'' – together with the other participants, be they human or otherwise environmental, becomes [,] in the process [,] modified."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=75|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dewey offered a sophisticated, yet [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to understanding man as an organism-environment purposefully designed to correct the "fragmentation of experience" often found in other philosophical approaches found in [[Subjectivism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]] and [[Skepticism]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:Transactionalism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

He asserted that human life is not organized into separate entities, as if the mind (emotions, feelings, creativity, imagination) and the world outside it (raw and manufactured goods as well as social roles and institutions such as family, school, and media) are irreconcilable, leading to the question "How does the mind know the world?"&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org.remote.baruch.cuny.edu/10.4135/9781506335193.n4|title=Pragmatism and the Philosophical Foundations of Mixed Methods Research1|last=Biesta|first=Gert|pages=95–118|doi=10.4135/9781506335193.n4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Historical antecedents ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Galileo refused to seek the causes of the behavior of physical phenomena in the phenomena alone and sought the causes in the conditions under which the phenomena occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9YVAAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=galileo|title=Emergent Human Nature: A Symbolic Field Interpretation|last=Coutu|first=Walter|date=1949-01-01|publisher=A.A.

Phillips]] (1927–2016), American professor emeritus in educational foundations and inquiry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/Retirees/documents/newsletters/May-2016.pdf|title=BGSU (Bowling Green State University) Retirees Association Newsletter, Vol. 21|last=|first=|date=May 2016|work=|access-date=2016-07-13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Bowling Green State University]] from 1963 to 1996, wrote a comprehensive review of the historical, philosophical, psychological, and educational development of transactionalism in his 1966 dissertation "Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study" republished in 2013 by Influence Ecology.  Phillips traced transactionalism's philosophical roots to Greek historians [[Polybius]] and [[Plato]], 17th century polymath and architect of the scientific revolution Galileo, as well as the architect of modern western philosophy, [[René Descartes]].

Galileo's contributions to the scientific revolution rested on an understanding of transactionalism from which he argued Aristotelian physics was wrong, as he wrote in ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'' (1632):&lt;blockquote&gt;"In that case, if it is denied that circular motion is peculiar to celestial bodies, and affirmed to belong to all naturally movable bodies, then one must choose one of two necessary consequences. Either the attributes of generable-ingenerable, alterable-inalterable, divisibleindivisible, etc., suit equally and commonly all world bodies – as much the celestial as the elemental – or Aristotle has wrongly and erroneously deduced, from circular motion, those attributes which he has assigned to celestial bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Galileo.html|title=Galileo Galilei {{!}} Calendars|website=www.webexhibits.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The philosophy abandons self-actional and interaction-al beliefs or suppositions as problem-solving in an objective world where co-operative exchange creates value in learning,&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt; and the foundation of transactional competence, how objects including people behave.  Galileo deviated from the then current Aristotelian thinking, which was defined by mere interactions rather than co-constituetive transacting among people with different interests who may be solving competing intentions or conditions of life.

=== Modern antecedents ===
Trevor Phillips also outlined the philosophy's more recent developments found in the American philosophical works of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], sociologist [[George Herbert Mead]] ([[symbolic interactionism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|edition=2|location=|pages=54|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; pragmatist [[William James]], educational philosopher [[John Dewey]],&lt;ref name="Pronko 229–254"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pronko|first=N.

Bentley|Arthur Bentley]].

Several sources credit anthropologist [[Fredrik Barth]] as the scholar first to apply the term 'transactionalism" in 1959.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/barth_fredrik.htm|title=Barth, Fredrik - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts|website=www.anthrobase.com|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781444332094_chunk_g978144433209423_ss1-50|title=Transactionalism or Transactional Analysis : Concise Dictionary of Social and Cultural Anthropology : Blackwell Reference Online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.blackwellreference.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a critique of structural functionalism, Barth offered a new interpretation of culture that did not portray an overly cohesive picture of society without attending to the "roles, relationships, decisions, and innovations of the individual."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia69.com/eng/d/transactionalism/transactionalism.htm|title=Transactionalism - Dictionary &amp; Encyclopedia|website=www.encyclopedia69.com|access-date=2016-08-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727225546/http://www.encyclopedia69.com/eng/d/transactionalism/transactionalism.htm|archivedate=July 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are transacting with one another at multiple levels of individual, group, and environment. Barth's study appears to not fully articulate how this is happening all-at-once as opposed to as if separate entities interacting (interactional):&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he "environment" of any ethnic group is not only defined by natural conditions, but also by the presence and activities of other ethnic groups on which it depends. Each group exploits only a section of the total environment [perhaps in keeping with the idea of a "transactional whole"], and leaves large parts of it open for other groups to exploit (p. 1079).&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|date=1956|title=Ecologic Relationships of Ethnic Groups in Swat, North Pakistan|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=58|issue=6|pages=1079–1089|doi=10.1525/aa.1956.58.6.02a00080|jstor=666295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Using examples from the people of the [[Swat District|Swat district]] of North [[Pakistan]]&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; and, later, in 1966, organization among Norwegian fishermen, Barth set out to demonstrate that social forms like [[kinship]] groups, economic institutions, and political alliances are generated by the actions and strategies of the individuals who deploy organized acts against a context of social [[Theory of constraints|constraints]]. "By observing how people interact with each other [through experience], an insight could be gained into the [interactional] nature of the competition, values and principles that govern individuals' choices."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This insight would be interactional at best and not transactional—reciprocal and co-constituetive transactions at the levels of individual, group, and environment (including man-as-organism and its ecological situations).

Some scholars argue transactionalism is a theory rather than philosophical approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7hEAAAAIAAJ|title=Models of Social Organization|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|date=1966-01-01|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barth's contribution was initially criticized for paying insufficient attention to cultural constraints on individualism though it influenced the qualitative method known as [[symbolic interactionism]] used in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HsiAAAAAMAAJ|title=Transaction and meaning: directions in the anthropology of exchange and symbolic behavior|last=Kapferer|first=Bruce|last2=Issues|first2=Institute for the Study of Human|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Institute for the Study of Human Issues|isbn=9780915980048|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a pragmatic and philosophical approach, transactionalism is recognizable in the theory of the "[[The Sociological Imagination|sociological imagination]]" by American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] (1959), in which personal troubles are linked to public issues. In other words, the ''transactional whole'' is not readily apparent at the level of individuals who at that level operate in a self-actional manner when larger forces of sociality, history, biology, and culture are all-at-once at work as part of a global dynamic. Humans are never outside this dynamic current; operating the system in some self-actional or even interactional way.

=== 21st century applications ===

==== Transactional competence ====
Modern architects of the philosophy are John Patterson and Kirkland Tibbels, co-founders of Influence Ecology, acquired, edited, and published, Phillips' dissertation (as is) in 2013. With a foreword written by Tibbels, a hardback and Kindle version was published under the title ''Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monograph is an account of how human [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] came to be viewed less as the behavior of static and/or mutually isolated entities, and more as dynamic aspects of events in the process of problem-solving, and thereby becoming or satisfying, the unavoidable and inescapable conditions of human life.

==== Transactional leadership (LAP) ====
In a new model of [[Organizational behavior|organizational management]] known as the "leadership-as-practice" Dewey and Bentley's [[Knowing and the Known]] categories of action—self-action, inter-action, and trans-action brings transactionalism into the C-suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bzt-CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=leadership+as+practice+raelin&amp;ots=9IUtX_wKCX&amp;sig=GAjaBWNFpxZBZeHA99cBSO4_1Co#v=onepage&amp;q=self-actional&amp;f=false|title=Leadership-as-Practice: Theory and Application|last=Raelin|first=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317408239|location=|pages=171|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transactional leadership practice is defined by its "trans-actors" who "enact new and unfolding meanings in on-going trans-actions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bzt-CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=leadership+as+practice+raelin&amp;ots=9IUtX_wKCX&amp;sig=GAjaBWNFpxZBZeHA99cBSO4_1Co#v=onepage&amp;q=self-actional&amp;f=false|title=Leadership-as-Practice: Theory and Application|last=Raelin|first=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317408239|location=|pages=167|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; situated in contrast to an older model leadership defined by self-actional (self-actors) and inter-actional (inter-actors) practices. In the latter, actors and situations often remain unchanged. In Leadership-as-Practice, Joseph A. Raelin distinguishes between a "[[Deliberate practice|practice]]" that extends and amplifies the meaning of work and its value vs. "practices" that are habitual and sequential activities evoked to simplify everyday routines. A transactional approach—leadership-as-practice—focuses attention on "existing entanglements, complexities, processes, [while also] distinguishing problems in order to coordinate roles, acts, and practices within a group or organization."  Said another way, "trans-action attends to emergent becoming"—a kind of seeing together--"rather than substantive being (Tsoukas and Chia 2002)" among the actors involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bzt-CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=leadership+as+practice+raelin&amp;ots=9IUtX_wKCX&amp;sig=GAjaBWNFpxZBZeHA99cBSO4_1Co#v=snippet&amp;q=inter-action&amp;f=false|title=Leadership-as-Practice: Theory and Application|last=Raelin|first=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317408239|location=|pages=160|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysics: transactional (vs. self-actional or interactional) ===
The transactional view of metaphysics—studying the nature of reality or what is real—deals with the inseparability of what is known and how humans inquire into what is known—both ''knowing and the known''.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hs208TpWwC|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=151|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the age of Aristotle, humans have shifted from one paradigm or system of "logic" to another before a transactional metaphysics evolved with a focus that examines and inquires into solving problems first and foremost based on the relationship of man as a biological organism (with a brain and a body) shaped by its environment. In the book ''Transactionalism'' (2015), the nature of reality is traced historically from ''self-action'' to ''interaction'' to ''transactional'' competence each as its own ''age of knowing'' or [[episteme]]''.''

The pre-Galilean age of knowing is defined by ''self-action'' "where things [and thereby people] are viewed as acting on their own powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hs208TpWwC|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=108|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Knowing and the Known]]'', Dewey and Bentley wrote, "The epistemologies, logics, psychologies and sociologies [of our day] are still largely [understood] on a self-actional basis."&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

The result of Newtonian physics'', interaction'' marks the second age of knowing; a system marked especially by the "third 'law of motion'—that action and reaction are equal and opposite".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

The third [[episteme]] is ''transactional'' competence''.''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transactionalism: An historical and interpretive study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=2013|isbn=|location=Ojai, CA.|pages=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With origins in the contributions of Darwin, "man's understandings are finite as opposed to infinite. In the same way, his views, goals, commitments, and beliefs have relative status as opposed to absolute."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=92|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dewey and Arthur Bentley asserted this competence as "the right to see together, extensionally and durationally, much that is talked about conventionally as if it were composed of irreconcilable separates."&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; We tend to avoid considering our actions as part of a dynamic and transactional whole, whether in mundane or complex activities; whether in making an invitation, request, or offer or in the complex management of a program or company. We tend to avoid studying, thinking, and planning our moves and moods for a comprehensive, reciprocal, and co-constitutive—in other words, ''transactional''—whole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowing and the known.|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur F.|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1949|isbn=978-0837184982|location=Boston|pages=104|quote=Referencing Arthur F. Bentley, Inquiry into Inquiries. Boston: The Beacon Press, 1954, p. 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transactional whole includes the organized acts including ideas, narratives, people as resources implementing ideas, services, and products, the things involved, settings, and personalities, all considered in and over time. With this competence, that which ''acts'' and is ''acted upon'' become united for a moment in a mutual or ethical exchange, where both are reciprocally transformed&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; contradicting "any absolute separation or isolation"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=74–5|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; often found in the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] thinking and categorization of [[Western thought]].

Dualistic thinking and categorization often lead to over-simplification of the transactional whole found in the convenient but ineffective resorting to "exclusive classifications." Such classifications tend to exclude and reify man as if he has dominion over his nature or the environment.

In his seminal 20th century work ''Physics and Philosophy'', [[Werner Heisenberg|Warner Heisenberg]] reflects this kind of transactionalist thinking: "What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” The together-at-once reality of man as organism-environment is often overlooked in the dualistic thinking of even major philosophers like Descartes who is often referenced for his "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" philosophy. Of a transactionalist approach, Heisenberg writes, "This was a possibility of which [[René Descartes|Descartes]] could not have thought, but it makes the sharp separation of the world and I impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJjuAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=questioning|title=Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|date=2007-05-08|publisher=HarperCollins|year=|isbn=9780061209192|location=|pages=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dualistic thinking prevents man from thinking. "In the spirit of [Charles Sanders] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], transactionalism substitutes continuity for discontinuity, change and interdependence for separateness."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=80|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in problem solving, whenever we "insert a name instead of a problem," when words like "soul," "mind," "need," "I.Q." or "trait" are expressed as if real, they have the power to block and distort free inquiry into what is known in fact or as fact in the transactional whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=81|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nature of change and being, "that which ''acts'' and that which is ''acted upon''" always undergo a reciprocal relationship that is affected by the presence and influence of the other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  We as human beings, as part of nature as an [[organism]] "integral to (as opposed to separate from, above or outside of) any investigation and inquiry may use a transactionalist approach to expand our personal [[knowledge]] so as to solve life's complex problems.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=45|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of ''transactionalism'' is not to discover what is already there, but for a person to seek and interpret senses, objects, places, positions, or any aspect of transactions between one's Self and one's environment (including objects, other people, and their symbolic interactions) in terms of the aims and desires each one needs and wants to satisfy and fulfill. It is essential that one simultaneously take into account the needs and desires of others in one's environment or ecology to avoid the self-actional or self-empowerment ideology of a rugged and competitive individualism. While other philosophies may discuss similar ethical concerns, this co-constitutive and reciprocal element of problem-solving is central to transactionalism.

To put it simply, "to experience is to transact; in point of fact, experience is a transaction of organism-environment."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In other words, what is "known" by the knower (or organism) is always filtered and shaped by both internal and external moods and narratives, mirrored in and through our relationships to the physical affordances and constraints in our environment or in specific ecologies.

The metaphysics of transactional inquiry is characterized in the pragmatic writing of William James who insists that "single barreled terms," terms like "thought" and "thing," actually stop or block inquiries into what is known and how we know it. Instead, a transactional orientation of ‘double-barreledness’ or the "interdependence of aspects of experience" must always be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=69|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; James offers his readers insight into the "double-barreledness" of experience with an apt proposition:&lt;blockquote&gt;Is the preciousness of a diamond a quality of the gem [the thing] or is it a feeling in our mind [the thought]? Practically we treat it as both or as either, according to the temporary direction of our thought. The ‘experienced’ and the ‘experiencing,’ the ‘seen’ and the ‘seeing,’ are, in actuality, only names for a single fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Transactionalism-Historical-Interpretive-Trevor-Phillips-ebook/dp/B018EOAAPI/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=70|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hs208TpWwC|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=53|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is real then, from a transactionist perspective, must be constantly reevaluated relative to man as organism-environment in a co-constituitive and reciprocal dynamic with people, personalities, situations, aims, and given the needs each party seeks to satisfy.

=== Epistemology: truth from inquiry ===
Transactionalists are firmly intolerant of "anything resembling an 'ultimate' truth -- or 'absolute' knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=101|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the evolution of psychology about the nature of man, transactionalists reject the notion of a mind-body split or anything resembling the bifurcation of what they perceive as the circuitry in which our biological stimulus-response exists. Examples transactionalists reject include the self-acting notions of Aristotle who posited that "the soul -- the psyche -- realized itself in and through the body, and that matter and form were two aspects involved in all existence." Later, the claims of French philosopher René Descartes, recognized as the father of modern Western philosophy, were examined and defined as "interactional". Descartes suggested  stimulus-response as the realm where the mind controls the body and the body may influence the rational mind out of the passion of our emotions.

Transactionalists recognize Cartesian dualism as a form of disintegrating the transactional whole of man "into two complete substances, joined to another no one knows how."&lt;ref name="Maritain 1944 179"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dream of Descartes|last=Maritain|first=J.|publisher=Philosophical Library|year=1944|isbn=|location=New York|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokhorst"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/pineal-gland/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Lokhorst|first=Gert-Jan|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body as a physical entity, on the one hand, and the soul or thought, on the other, was regarded in a Cartesian mindset as "an angel inhabiting a machine and directing it by means of the pineal gland"&lt;ref name="Maritain 1944 179"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokhorst"/&gt; This tranactionalists reject.

Man has the propensity to treat the mind and thought or the mind and body as abstractions and this tendency to deny the interrelatedness or coordinated continuity results in misconceptions in learning and inaccurate thinking as humans move and thrive with an ecology.  Accurate thinking and learning begins and is constantly developed through action resulting from thought as a repetitive circuit of experience known in psychology as deliberate practice. Educational philosopher Trevor Phillips, now deceased, frames this tendency to falsely organize our perception: "[W]e fail to realize that we can know nothing about things [or ourselves] beyond their significance to us," otherwise we distort our "reality" and treat things we perceive within it, including our bodies or mind, as if concrete thereby "denying the interconnectedness of realities" (plural).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=102|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactionalists suggest that accurate (or inaccurate) thinking is rarely considered an unintended consequence of our propensity for abstractions.

When an individual transacts through intelligent or consequential actions circumscribed within the constraints and conditions of her/his environment in a reflexive, repetitive arc of learned experience, there is a "transaction between means and ends" (see reference below). This transactional approach features twin aspects of a larger event rather than merely manipulating the means to an end in our circumstances and situations. For instance, a goal can never be produced by abstraction, by simply thinking about or declaring a promise to produce a result. Nor can it be anticipated or foreseen (an abstraction at best) without a significant "pattern of inquiry," as John Dewey later defined and articulated, into the constraints and conditions that happen and are happening given the interdependence of all the people and objects involved in a simple or complex transaction. The nature of our environment affects all these entities within a transaction. Thus, revealing the limiting and reductive notion of manipulating a psychology around stimulus and response found in Aristotilian or Cartesian thought.

A transaction is recognized here as one that occurs between the "means and ends;" in other words, transactional competence is derived from the "distinctions between the how, the what (or subject-matter), and the why (or what for)." This transactional whole constitutes a reciprocal connection and a reflexive arc of learned and lived experience.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=105|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a transactional approach one can derive a certain kind of value from one's social exchange. Value in knowing how, what, and why the work done with your mind and body fulfill on the kinds of transactions needed to live a good and satisfying life that functions well with others. Truth from actual inquiry is foundational for organism-environment to define and live by a set of workable ethical values that functions with others.

=== Ethics: reciprocal and co-constitutive ===
While ''self-interest'' governs the ethical principles of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], here the principle is that man as an organism is in a ''reciprocal, constitutive'' relationship with her/his environment. Disabusing the psychological supposition of our "skin-boundedness" (discussed further below), transactionalism rejects the notion that we are apart from our environment or that man has dominion over it. Man, woman, and child must view life and be viewed in the undifferentiated whole of ''organism-environment''. This reciprocal and co-constitutive relationship is what sets Transactionalism apart from other philosophies.

What John Dewey meant by "reciprocal" was that:&lt;blockquote&gt;... consequences have to be determined on the grounds of what is selected and handled as means in exactly the same sense in which the converse holds and demands constant attention if activities are to be intelligently conducted.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/John-Dewey-Arthur-Bentley-Correspondence/dp/B000OKT5RA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473454738&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ratner+and+altman|title=John Dewey and Arthur F.

Whether the environment is natural or man-made, whether discussing biology, sociology, culture, linguistics, history and memory, or economics and physics, every ''organism-environment'' is ''reciprocal, constitutive, socially-conditioned and'' constantly in flux demanding our ethical attention to conditions and consequences as we live life. [[John Dewey]] and [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], like [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] before them, were out to distinguish an ethical "living" logic rather than a static one.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Both rejected the supposition that man had dominion over or governed behavior in his/her environment embracing a presupposition of transactionalism; we are ''reciprocal, co-constitutive, socially-conditioned, and motivated'' "together-at-once" as we seek solutions to living a good life.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJmuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=intradermal+psychological&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TCIe_q8yzG&amp;sig=4yqwJ_qzHyBZ425LEo-G26PNg38&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieno3d_a_RAhWEZCYKHflKDdEQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intradermal%20psychological&amp;f=false|title=Beyond Behaviorism|last=Lee|first=Vicki L.|date=2016-07-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317247524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transactionalists reject the "localization" of our psychology as if "skin-bound."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Bentley wrote, "No creature lives merely under its skin." In other words, we should not define and distinguish experience in and from the subjective mind and feelings. Conversely, we cannot rely solely on external circumstances or some static or inherited logic. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] said of followers of Aristotle in seeking ethical knowledge that one should "come with arguments and demonstrations of your own...but bring us no more texts and naked authorities, for our disputes are about the sensible world and not a paper one."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Humans are always transacting, "together-at-once,"&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJmuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=%22because+without+the+context,+the+action+would+not+be+the+action+it+is.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TCIe-h8BEM&amp;sig=8AeBPz3oIbZXhHlQp8t3uZzOU8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc0pynpLDRAhVKylQKHVD2BjYQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22because%20without%20the%20context,%20the%20action%20would%20not%20be%20the%20action%20it%20is.%22&amp;f=false|title=Beyond Behaviorism|last=Lee|first=Vicki L.|date=2016-07-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317247524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of, shaped by, and shap-ing the experience we call "knowledge" as an ''organism-environment''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Dewey and Bentley were intrigued by, and ultimately questioned, "the significance of the concept ‘skin’ and its role in philosophical and psychological thought."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They offered a biological or natural justification that came to define a transactionalist approach. The known and what is known are both a function of man having "evolved among other organisms" within natural selection or evolution.

Man's most intellectual and advanced "knowings" are not merely outgrowths of his own doing or being. The natural evolution of things outside our knowingness creates the very context in which our known and knowings arise. We are not inventing what is known outside or, in a vacuum beyond, who we are and who we are is an organism-environment together-at-once.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  We are not creatures separated by skin with an internal world of the mind and body "in here" separate from an environment of objects and people "out there". Human beings intelligently live, adapt to, and organize life in a reciprocal, co-constitutive experience that is what Dewey and Bentley term "trans-dermal".

A "trans-dermal" experience demands knowledgeable and accurate inquiry into the conditions and consequences of each transaction where the organizing of ideas and acts (knowledge), is itself a transaction which grows out of the problem-solving and creative exploring within the universe of social situations in which we exist. Dewey and Bentley wrote, "truth, or for that matter falsity, is a function of the deliberately striven for consequences arising out of inquiry."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Our behavior and acts in knowing, or transacting, must be considered "together" and "at-once" with its conditions and consequences for any ambitious movement or fulfillment to occur alone and among other people in any setting with objects and constructd inherited from others known and unknown over time. Transacting demands study, a slowing down of our movement, and the development of a transactional competence in order to fulfill certain needs or solve problems while functioning among others.

In Dewey's final days, wrote Phillips, he emphasized the twin aspects of attending to both the means and the ends of any transaction: "It is…impossible to have an end-in-view or to anticipate the consequences of any proposed line of action." A "trans-dermal" consciousness is, therefore, key to moving ethically. To move, experience life, or transact in a principled manner, considering the reciprocal and co-constituitive nature of organism-environment becomes an [[wikt:object lesson|object lesson]] governing both social behavior as well as in transacting from a trans-dermal view with objects or other bodies.

==== Trans-dermal experience ====
The work of Australian educational philosopher [[Vicki L. Lee]] further elucidates and breaks down what is "trans-dermal" experience—how it works and why it matters—based on her work in the [[philosophy of cognitive science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philpapers.org/s/Vicki%20L.%20Lee|title=Works by Vicki L. Lee - PhilPapers|website=philpapers.org|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[educational philosophy]], and [[radical behaviorism]] about which she has published extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Vicki L.|date=1987-01-01|title=The Structure of Conduct|journal=Behaviorism|volume=15|issue=2|pages=141–148|jstor=27759127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This complex paradigm is clearly evidenced by Lee in this thickly described example:   &lt;blockquote&gt;Acts are more than movements. ...Our discriminations depend on movements and their contexts seen together-at-once or as an undifferentiated whole. In discriminating watering the garden from hosing the driveway, we see the bodily movements and their occasion and results. We see the garden, the watering implement, and so forth, as much as we see the body's activities. The notion of together-at-once emphasizes that we do not see movements and contexts separately and then infer the action. Rather the context is internal to the action, because without the context, the action would not be the action it is.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A basic presupposition of the philosophy of transactionalism is to always consider that that which is known about the world (extra-dermal) is "directly concerned with the activity of the knower" which is merely from some sense of "skin-boundedness" (intra-dermal). The known and the knower, as Dewey and Bentley examined in detail in their collaborative publication, must always be considered "'twin aspects of common fact."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Behavior, movement, and acts are not merely a function of the mind, of wishful or positive thinking or belief in external forces, nor can it be determined ethically from the philosophers of the past or knowledge written in a book. It is our ability to transact trans-dermally—to be and become ecologically-fit as an organism-environment—that begets truthful inquiry into living a good and satisying life, functioning well among others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Philosophy and Women's Studies Professor Shannon Sullivan explores and applies "transactional knowing through embodied and relational lived experience"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=182842|title=Living Across and Through Skins|last=Sullivan|first=Shannon|date=2001|website=Indiana University Press|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a feminist epistemology developed out of the pragmatist tradition.

=== Politics: Cooperation and knowing-as-inquiry ===
The branch of philosophy recognized as "politics" concerns the governance of community and group interaction, not merely that of the state as conceived when thinking of a local or national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy|last=Blackburn|first=Simon|date=2016-05-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191799556|edition=3|location=http://www.oxfordreference.com|pages=s.v., "politics, philosophy of"|language=English|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Laws of Motion'' (1920), physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] articulated the modern conception of "transaction" used here—one that is not exclusive to an economic context limited to only the opposition of a buyer-seller in a trade or other analougous uses. Unlike its use in commercial affairs, there is a radical departure from any tendency to perceive buyer-seller (as well as organism-environment) as opposing or separate forces. In a transactionalist approach, Maxwell (as well as others) view the former and latter as "two parts of the same phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=XXq9qgnWtbMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=j+maxwell+clerk+1920&amp;ots=0o8xj9QN40&amp;sig=BNp7vIN-FKXs47N2YQHYP6KT96g#v=onepage&amp;q=transaction&amp;f=false|title=Matter and Motion|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|date=1920-01-01|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486668956|location=|pages=27|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Dewey and Bentley apply this notion of 'transactional' to learning more than any other context. In the educative process, acting without knowing is a separation of the same phenomenon enjoined in inquiry. Without inquiry acting does not work. Acting and knowing cooperate to provide knowledge to an organism-environment which must essentially involve inquiry into things that have happened and are happening: &lt;blockquote&gt;Knowledge – if the term is to be employed at all – is a name for the product of competent inquiries, and is constituted only as the outcome of a particular inquiry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is not "a process taking place, or as a status located in or at an animal organism."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Knowledge arises from inquiry and the testing of that inquiry to insure the fitness of not only the solution but the organism-environment. While a human being is central or "nuclear" to its organism-environment,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; it must abdicate any sense of dominion over the socio-biological cosmos of which human being is part and never outside of. Each situation—and this transactionalists assert is radical—must be examined and determined by a construction of moves and action based on the capacity of that organism to fulfill its intentions and thrive (or not). Dewey and Bentley later insisted that knowing "as inquiry, [is therefore] a way, or distinct form, of behavior."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Transactionalists define politics in this philosophy as a cooperative, genuine interaction between all participating parties whether buyer-seller, student-teacher, or worker-boss given that we are biological and social subjects&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/JohnDeweyLogicTheTheoryOfInquiry/%5BJohn_Dewey%5D_Logic_-_The_Theory_of_Inquiry_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "[John Dewey] Logic The Theory Of Inquiry"|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.org|publisher=|page=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved not merely in "transacting" for our own advantage or gain. "[S]ocial phenomena cannot be understood except as there is prior understanding of physical conditions and the laws of their [socio-biological] interactions," wrote [[John Dewey]] in ''[[Logic: The Theory of Inquiry]]''.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; He added further, "Inquiry into [social phenomena], with respect both to data that are significant and to their relations or proper ordering, is conditioned upon extensive prior knowledge of physical phenomena and their laws. This fact accounts in part for the retarded and immature state of social subjects." Thus, cooperation and knowing as inquiry is foundational to governing communal affairs of any kind including economic trade and the educative process.

In our existing models of formal education, we bifurcate what Dewey viewed as indispensable. We, as a rule, segregate "utility and culture, absorption and expression, theory and practice....in any educational scheme"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=165|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, progressive educator [[Elsie Ripley Clapp]] distinguished a similar commitment to "cooperative transaction of inquiry" in her vision that enjoined community and school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001449588|title=The use of resources in education|last=Clapp|first=Elsie Ripley.|date=1952-01-01|publisher=Harper|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=vii-xi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligence, meaning that which is acquired through inquiry and testing, allows man to foresee consequences and take control of his actions without dogma or beliefs (that might be wrong) derived from past experience or expectations.  If the study of politics in philosophy is a "study of force," of knowing "what actions are permissible" given that man is an organism-environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/FiveBranchesMain.html|title=Branches of Philosophy|last=Landauer|first=Jeff|last2=Rowlands|first2=Joseph|date=2001|website=www.importanceofphilosophy.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; then transactionalists assert that cooperation and knowing-as-inquiry are vital to functioning among others.

''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' noted that Dewey was critical of the classical neoliberal stance that the asbtract individual precedes a conception of society or social institutions. Dewey maintained that social institutions were not a "means for obtaining something for individuals. They are means for 'creating' individuals" (''Reconstruction in Philosophy'', ''MW''12, 190-192). In this way, classical liberalism seems to exemplify ‘the most pervasive fallacy of philosophical thinking’ (‘Context and Thought’, ''LW''5, 5). Transactionalism is a radical form of governing that resists the tendency to "divide up experienced phenomena, and to take the distinct analysed elements to be separate existences, independent both of the analysis and of each other."&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dewey-political/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Festenstein|first=Matthew|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent thinking is anti-dualistic, accurate, forethought taking into account other people, communities, and cultures that stems from a "deliberate control of what is done with reference to making what happens to us and what we do to things as fertile as possible of suggestions (of suggested meanings)." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Transactionalism.html?id=JbC_nQEACAAJ|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor Joseph|date=1967-01-01|publisher=Xerox University Microfilms|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=175|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, intelligent thinking is a means for trying out the validity of those suggestions. The political governing of thinking towards dualisms and bifurcation as well as the "false conception of the individual" is what Dewey argued limited man's free, meaning "liberal", thought and action. All of this served as the core reasoning behind Dewey's development of an experimental philosophy that offset elite distortions regarding a public and transactional interest in education and learning.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== Individual as co-constitutive, organism-environment ====
Transationalist psychologists and educational philosophers reject the ideologies precipitated from Western ideologies of "[[Do It Yourself (disambiguation)|do-it-yourself]]" or the "if it's up to me, it will be" mentality that leads to entitlement and the naiveté of slogans like "follow your passion" that deny any consideration of our trans-dermal condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.influenceecology.com/category/podcast/|title=Podcast Archives – Influence Ecology|last=|first=|date=|website=Influence Ecology|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-07|quote=#20: Joanna Burgraf - Worst Advice Ever: Follow Your Passion by Influence Ecology / December 19, 2016 Joanna Burgraf is a Chicago-based senior lead for an award-winning creative services team managing ten brands at Enova International, a company using technology to develop innovative financial products.

Transactionalist psychologists and philosophers replace once sought-after [[Existentialism]] as a remedy to feelings of alienation with a trans-dermal orientation to living. Rather than applying a theory or approach that emphasizes the individual as a "free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=existentialism&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8|title=existentialism - Google Search|website=www.google.com|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; subjects are invited to co-create as an organism-environment functioning among all other organism-environments, including the conditions and consequences of objects and personalities, in order to intelligently structure existence in and amongst it all. The very act of participating in co-creation, according to transactionalists, gives and allows each person her/his unique status and dignity in their environment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Aesthetics: Value-satisfaction from an assumptive world ===
Distinct from an [[Aesthetic Theory|aesthetic theory]] of [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] or a rationale for the beauty in an object of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/aesthetic-concept/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Shelley|first=James|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a transactionalist theory of [[aesthetics]] concerns the perceptual judgments we use to define value, purposeful activity or satisfaction in any experience. Based on studies by transactionalist psychologists [[Adelbert Ames Jr.|Adelbert Ames, Jr.]] (known for The Ames Demonstrations&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Weipeng Liu (YouTube Channel)|title=Ames' Window|date=2009-03-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc_LqIaO2b8|accessdate=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[William Howard Ittelson]], [[Hadley Cantril]], along with [[John Dewey]], the biological role of perception is key to understanding transactionalism. Perceiving is viewed as "part of the process of living by which each one of us, from his own particular point of view, creates for himself the world within which he has his life’s experiences and through which he strives to gain his satisfactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Perception.html?id=yFEAAAAAMAAJ|title=Perception: A Transactional Approach|last=Ittelson|first=William Howard|last2=Cantril|first2=Hadley|date=1954-01-01|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=23|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sum total of these assumptions was recognized as the "assumptive world."&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=146|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumptive world stems from all that we [[experience]], all the things and events we assess and assign meaning to, which function as a ''contextual whole'' also known as a ''transactional whole''. Dewey also referred to the assumptive world as a "situation" (where organism and environment are inseparable) or as a "field" in which behavior, stimulus, and response are framed as if a ''reflexive circuit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/JohnDeweyLogicTheTheoryOfInquiry|title=[John Dewey] Logic The Theory Of Inquiry|last=Dewey|first=John|date=1938-01-01|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=67|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "To the modern transactionalist, experiences alter perceptual processes, and in the act of altering them, the purposing aspect of perception is either furthered or its fulfillment interfered with."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=189|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is through action, through movement, that man is capable of bringing forth a value-satisfaction to his or her experience.  Man's capacity to "sense value in the quality of his experience" was registered through his serial expectations and standards stemming from previous transactions throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=144–5|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory of value is therefore derived from one's behavioral inquiry within an assumptive world. "Knowledge is a transaction that develops out of man's explorations within [that] cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=102|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactionalists reject the notion that any truth is inherently settled or beyond question. The consequences of any inquiry will be dependent on the ''situation'' or transactional whole in which man as an organism-environment finds him- or her-self.

To clarify the theory of valuation for man, John Dewey wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To declare something ''satisfactory'' [vs. satisfying] is to assert that it meets specifiable conditions. It is, in effect, a judgment that the thing 'will do'. It involves a prediction; it contemplates a future in which the thing will continue to serve; it ''will'' do. It asserts a consequence the thing will actively institute, it ''will''  do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/JohnDeweyLogicTheTheoryOfInquiry|title=[ John Dewey] Logic The Theory Of Inquiry|last=Dewey|first=John|date=1938-01-01|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=261|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Transactionalism-Historical-Interpretive-Trevor-Phillips-ebook/dp/B018EOAAPI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=104|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately, transactionalism is a move away from the conclusion that knowledge depends on an independent knower and something to be known.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The reality of a particular situation depends, transactionally speaking, on the interpretation place[d] upon the situation by a particular person. Interpretation is possible only through the accumulation of experience which, in effect, is what is meant by “assumptions”.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Without the hitches and mistakes one encounters in the welter of daily living, the nature of the assumptive world would never arise into consciousness.  The assumptive world, initially highlighted in the 25 experiments in perception known as The Ames demonstrations, becomes the seeming reality of our world.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Man’s transactions of living involve, in sum, capacities, and aspects of his nature operating together. To transact is to participate in the process of translating the ongoing energies of the environment into one’s own perceptual awareness, and to transform the environment through the perceptual act.  Value-satisfaction arises when the inadequacies of man's assumptive world are revealed or invalidated.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Thereby, the consequences of any transactional experience determines what is valuable or what will do vs. that which is satisfying but will not do.  The good life, for the transactionalist, consists of a unity of values, achieved by means of reflective thought, and accepted in the full light of their conditions and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=106|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To transact is to act intelligently with an aim in mind while avoiding the tendency to surrender one's awareness to complacency or indifference that stems from mere information or untested knowledge. Without action, a person can fool herself, distort her sense of satisfaction or value on behalf of consequences she or others prefer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=161|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through action, the individual perceptions and the shared perceptual common sense of an assumptive world are validated and modified.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregory|first=Richard L|year=1987|title=Analogue Transactions with Adelbert Ames|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.remote.baruch.cuny.edu/doi/abs/10.1068/p160277|journal=Perception|volume=16|issue=3|pages=277–282|doi=10.1068/p160277|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; We predict and refine our conditions of life yet "any standard set for these value qualities is influenced by the individual’s personal biological and life history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=160|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactionalism is a creativee process that takes into account the unique biology and biography of persons involved.

==  Generational significance ==
The importance of the study of transactionalism arose in the late 1960s in response to an "alienation syndrome"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|page=27|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; among youth of that generation. As the counter-culture challenged and reassessed society's "philosophical-psychological complex, its ''[[Weltanschauung]]'',"&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/paltow|title=Toward A Theory of Cultural Linguistics|last=Palmer.|first=Gary B.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; their political and social alienation sparked protests against the war and the draft as well as historic racial rebellions in various U.S. cities.  The [[Long hot summer of 1967]] and the counterculture movement named the [[Summer of Love]] also in 1967 reflected the antipathy of young people who questioned everything. American society's norms and values were perceived as denying dignity to all. Riots of the period were studied in a report by the U.S. [[Kerner Commission]] and scholars began to study the patterns of alienation expressed by youth in the sixties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisner|first=Victor|date=1969-02-01|title=Alienation of Youth|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1746-1561.1969.tb04289.x/abstract|journal=Journal of School Health|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=81–90|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.1969.tb04289.x|issn=1746-1561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zack|first=John J.|date=1970-06-01|title=The Alienation of Youth|journal=Canadian Family Physician|volume=16|issue=6|pages=56–59|issn=0008-350X|pmc=2281733|pmid=20468522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Marvin E.|date=1969-03-01|title=Two Categories of Political Alienation|url=http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/3/288|journal=Social Forces|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=288–299|doi=10.2307/2575027|issn=0037-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watts|first=William A.|last2=Lynch|first2=Steve|last3=Whittaker|first3=David|date=1969-01-01|title=Alienation and activism in today's college-age youth: Socialization patterns and current family relationships.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cou/16/1/1/|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|language=English|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1037/h0026683|issn=1939-2168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polk|first=Kenneth|date=1969-10-01|title=Class, Strain and Rebellion Among Adolescents|url=http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/2/214|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=214–224|doi=10.2307/799867|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Youth sought a kind of [[existentialism]] expressed by a need to be "true to oneself." This current of alienation unfortunately veered away from a relevant understanding of the transactional whole taking into account the reciprocal and co-constitutive nature of man as an organism-environment fulfilling important conditions of life with others all the time. It resembles the famous line from ''[[Devotions upon Emergent Occasions]]'', written by English poet John Donne -- "No man is an island". Transactionalism presented an alternative to the limitation and unintended outcomes of the alienation syndrome.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Benefits and applications==
Designed to account for all aspects of experience—subjective and objective—transactionalism requires a slowing down in assessing all the facts involved with the how, what, when, where, and why as we move to transact with others. It demands and requires always considering how a transaction with another and one's self (e.g., a parent or spouse spending additional hours socializing at the gym) is or is not beneficial to all involved in a transaction (e.g., other members of the family). The costs may be in time, attention, or money or in a condition of life (e.g., family, career, sleep). Transactionalism requires an interdependence of thought, study, and action.

A transactionalist must account for one's biology and cognition ([[metaphysics]]); the ways knowing reality ([[epistemology]]); the reciprocal, co-constitutive, relationship (or [[ethics]]) between our social self and the interactions constrained by both our natural and man-made environment. We as human beings live in distinct sociological patterns with people, material and immaterial culture shaped by specific and ever-changing times and places further articulated by increasing migration and globalization. Transactionalism insists that one attend to the political distribution of goods and services along with the ways its value has and is exchanged and changing among people and groups ([[politics]]) as well as how persons are socialized to understand what it means to live a good life as well as fulfill those conditions over time ([[aesthetics]]).

Transactionalism offers more than existentialism offered with its aim of being "true to oneself." The alienation that results from its orientation to the self at the expense of societal norms and values, even in small groups, often leads to naiveté, despair, frustration, agitation, and even indifference, at the expense of consciously organizing one's acts, while functioning among others, to fulfill one's unique and necessary interests in living a good and satisfying life. Transactionalism counters the naive  "do as I see fit" mentality of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] regardless of other's needs and concerns, which inevitably leads to negative consequences and outcomes over time. Transactionalism depends upon the "integration of man and his surroundings."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Phillips' dissertation documented the evolution of a "transactional approach;" one that rests on the fact that we are [[Biological basis of personality|biological]], [[Linguistic performance|linguistic]], and that we must transact considering a trans-dermal experience of our thoughts, behavior, and exchange on every level imagined while ethically functioning with others well.

A series of podcasts exemplify the application of a transactional approach to a diverse array of professionals from various countries .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/influence-ecology/id1146278689|title=Influence Ecology by Influence Ecology on iTunes|website=iTunes|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
