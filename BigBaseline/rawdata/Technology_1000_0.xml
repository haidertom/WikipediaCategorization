The '''Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator''', or '''ATLAS''', is a large [[hydraulic]] [[motion simulator]]. It was designed, as the name implies, for the theme park industry. The ATLAS is a product of Rediffusion Simulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peltz|first1=James F.|title=Hughes Agrees to Sell Flight Simulator Unit|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-25/business/fi-60803_1_flight-simulator|accessdate=August 24, 2014|date=November 25, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sussex]], [[England]], now owned by [[Thales Group]] and known as [[Thales Training &amp; Simulation]]. Disney filed multiple patents on their variant of the device, including US Utility Patent #5161104 [https://www.google.com/patents/US5161104].

The ATLAS was derived from military flight simulation technology. It uses six hydraulic actuators to provide a broad range of movement.

In the later half of the 1980s, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] bought and refined this technology for two theme park attractions; [[Star Tours]] at [[Disneyland]] (and later [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]]) and [[Body Wars]] at [[Epcot]]. The technology was also used in 2016 for the [[Iron Man Experience]] at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]. The Disney attractions feature large, 40-person cabins hidden from outside view, arranged lengthwise with four or six simulators per installation. There are four simulators at Disneyland's Star Tours and EPCOT's Body Wars, while the remaining Star Tours installations have six. Body Wars is now defunct and the simulators have been removed from the building in the years since the closure of the [[Wonders of Life]] pavilion.

'''Alphagov''' was the project name of the experimental prototype website built by the [[Government Digital Service]] and launched on 11 May 2011 by the UK [[Cabinet Office]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Government launches single government website prototype |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/government-launches-single-government-website-prototype |publisher=[[Cabinet Office]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Work begins on Alphagov single government website |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8416250/Work-begins-on-Alphagov-single-government-website.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 |location=London |first=Matt |last=Warman |date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was open for public comment for two months in order to judge the feasibility of a single domain for [[British Government]] web services.

==Purpose==
Launched in response to the report by [[Martha Lane Fox]] ''Directgov 2010 and Beyond: Revolution Not Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directgov 2010 and Beyond: Revolution Not Evolution |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution |publisher=[[Cabinet Office]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that was published in November 2010. Alphagov sought to act as a proof of concept for the way citizens could interact with Government through a series of useful online tools, where they were more useful than published content alone.

As well as improving the 'citizen experience' of using government web services online the project also identified the potential for £64 million in yearly savings on central government's annual £128 million current web publishing bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New government web domain to save £64m, but at what cost? |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/11/new-government-web-domain-to-save-64-but-at-what-cost/ |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 |location=London |first=Kevin |last=Rawlinson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716234722/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/11/new-government-web-domain-to-save-64-but-at-what-cost/ |archive-date=2011-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
This initial consultation period was completed in June 2011. A [[Beta_version#Beta|beta version]] was then created, which led to the launch of [[GOV.UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alpha.gov.uk to become beta |url=https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2011/jun/27/alpha-gov-uk-central-government-website-becomes-beta-version |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amazon Simple Notification Service''' (SNS) is a [[notification service]] provided as part of [[Amazon Web Services]] since 2010. It provides a low-cost infrastructure for the mass delivery of messages, predominantly to mobile users.

From the sender's viewpoint, SNS acts as a single [[message bus]] that can message to a variety of devices and platforms, from the [[Kindle Fire]] to [[Baidu]]. A single code interface can address all of these equally, or message formats can be tailored to the particular needs of each platform.&lt;ref name="Amazon SNS, DG" /&gt;

SNS can also deliver messages by [[Short Message Service|SMS]] to 200+ countries.&lt;ref name="Amazon SNS" /&gt;

SNS uses the [[publish/subscribe]] model for [[push technology|push delivery]] of messages.&lt;ref name="Amazon SNS, Introduction" /&gt; Recipients subscribe to one or more 'topics' within SNS. Typically this is hidden from the user as an internal part of a [[mobile app]].&lt;ref name="Medium, SNS iOS" /&gt; Receipt of a message may also be hidden from the user: this service is largely aimed at the internal processing of specific apps, rather than as a generic email substitute. A game might receive bonus level announcements or unlock keys for in-game purchases by this route. A ticket booking app could use it for confirmation vouchers, boarding passes or notifications of a delay to a flight.

Costs (2016) are quoted as $1.00 to send one million mobile notifications.&lt;ref name="Amazon SNS" /&gt; Pricing varies according to the delivery mechanism: there is a charge to request a message ($0.50 /million) and a varying charge for how (and if) the recipient chooses to receive it. HTTP is cheapest for retrieval ($0.60 /million), email is around 30 times this ($20 /million) and SMS considerably (hundreds of times) more ($7,500 /million).&lt;ref name="Amazon SNS, FAQs" /&gt; Like most [[cloud service]]s, initial access costs are kept low and there are no sign-up or subscription charges.

'''B2MML''' or '''Business To Manufacturing Markup Language''' is an XML implementation of the ANSI/[[Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society|ISA]]-95 family of standards ([[ISA-95]]), known internationally as IEC/ISO 62264. B2MML consists of a set of [[XML]] schemas written using the [[World Wide Web Consortium]]'s [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] language (XSD) that implement the data models in the ISA-95 standard.

B2MML is meant to be a common data definition to link [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] and supply chain management systems with manufacturing systems such as [[Industrial Control Systems]] and [[Manufacturing Execution Systems]].

B2MML is published by the [[Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association]] (MESA).

'''Basic English''' is an [[English language|English]]-based [[Controlled natural language|controlled language]] created by linguist and philosopher [[Charles Kay Ogden]] as an [[international auxiliary language]], and as an aid for teaching [[ESL|English as a second language]]. Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English. It was presented in Ogden's book ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930).

Ogden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest publicity just after the Allied victory in [[World War II]] as a means for world peace. Although Basic English was not built into a program, similar simplifications have been devised for various international uses. Ogden's associate [[I. A. Richards]] promoted its use in schools in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886748,00.html Time Magazine. Dec. 31, 1945. ''Education: Globalingo'']&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has influenced the creation of [[Voice of America]]'s [[Special English]] for news broadcasting, and [[Simplified Technical English]], another English-based controlled language designed to write technical manuals.

What survives today of Ogden's Basic English is the basic 850-word list used as the beginner's vocabulary of the English language taught worldwide, especially in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmond H Weiss ''The Elements of International English Style'', pp. 17-18, M. E. Sharpe, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-7656-1572-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design principles ==
Ogden tried to simplify English while keeping it normal for native speakers, by specifying grammar restrictions and a [[controlled natural language|controlled small vocabulary]] which makes an extensive use of [[Paraphrase|paraphrasing]]. Most notably, Ogden allowed only 18 verbs, which he called "operators".  His ''General Introduction'' says "There are no 'verbs' in Basic English", with the underlying assumption that, as noun use in English is very straightforward but verb use/conjugation is not, the elimination of verbs would be a welcome simplification.&lt;ref&gt;A good summary in Bill Templer: ''Towards a People's English: Back to BASIC in EIL'' [http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 Humanising Language Teaching] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204112933/http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 |date=December 4, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|What the World needs most is about 1,000 more dead languages—and one more alive.|C. K. Ogden, The System of Basic English}}

== Word lists ==
Ogden's word lists include only word roots, which in practice are extended with the defined set of affixes and the full set of forms allowed for any available word (noun, pronoun, or the limited set of verbs).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordthere.html the list of words which are assumed and not counted] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; The 850 core words of Basic English are found in Wiktionary's [[wikt:Appendix:Basic English word list|Basic English word list]]. This core is theoretically enough for everyday life. However, Ogden prescribed that any student should learn an additional 150-word list for everyday work in some particular field, by adding a list of 100 words particularly useful in a general field (e.g., science, verse, business, etc.), along with a 50-word list from a more specialised subset of that general field, to make a [[wikt:Appendix:1000 basic English words|basic 1000-word]] vocabulary for everyday work and life.

Moreover, Ogden assumed that any student already should be familiar with (and thus may only review) a core subset of around 200 "international" words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpi.html Ogden's "International Word" List—Alphabetic]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a first-level student should graduate with a core vocabulary of around 1200 words. A realistic general core vocabulary could contain 2000 words (the core 850 words, plus 200 international words, and 1000 words for the general fields of trade, economics, and science). It is enough for a "standard" English level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpn.html Ogden's Basic English Next Steps]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/word2000.html Ogden's Basic English Combined Word Lists]&lt;/ref&gt; This 2000 word vocabulary represents "what any learner should know". At this level students could start to move on their own.

Ogden's [[:simple:Wikipedia:Basic English combined wordlist|Basic English 2000 word list]] and Voice of America's [[:simple:Wikipedia:VOA Special English Word Book|Special English 1500 word list]] serve as dictionaries for the [[Simple English Wikipedia]].

== Rules ==
&lt;!-- Please do not remove or change this Copyvio message until the issue is settled --&gt;

&lt;!-- Do not use the "Copyvio/core" template directly; the above line is generated by "subst:Copyvio|url" --&gt;
The [[grammar|word use]] of Basic English is similar to full English, but the rules are much simpler, and there are fewer [[wikt:exception|exceptions]]. Not all meanings of each word are allowed.

Ogden's rules of [[grammar]] for Basic English help people use the 850 words to talk about things and events in a normal way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rules of Grammar | url = http://ogden.basic-english.org/rules.html | date = 1 January 1996 | accessdate = 2009-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Form plurals by appending an "S" on the end of the word. Where special rules are normally necessary, such as using "ES" or "IES", use them.
*There are two word endings to change each of the 150 adjectives:  "-ER" and "-EST".
*There are two word endings to change the verb word endings, "-ING" and "-ED".
*Form adverbs from qualifiers by adding "-LY".
*Talk about amounts with "MORE" and "MOST".  Use and know "-ER" and "-EST".
*Give adjectives a negative meaning with "UN-"
*Form questions with the opposite word order, and with "DO".
*Operators and pronouns [[inflection|inflect]] as in normal English.
*Make [[:simple:Wikipedia:Basic English compound wordlist|combined words]] ([[compound word|compound]]s) from two nouns (for example "milkman") or a noun and a directive ("sundown").
*Measures, numbers, money, days, months, years, clock time, and international words are in English forms, e.g. Date/Time: 20 May 1972 at 21:00
*Where necessary, technical expressions or other terms required for the task at hand may be used and take on their local form.

== Criticism ==
Like all [[international auxiliary language]]s (or IALs), Basic English may be criticised as inevitably based on personal preferences, and thus, paradoxically, inherently divisive.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Harrison, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230133/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html Farewell to Auxiliary Languages]''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, like all natural language based IALs, Basic is subject to criticism as unfairly biased towards the native speaker community.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a sample quotation from [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512A&amp;L=AUXLANG&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2560 the auxlang mailing list archives] and another from noted linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teaching aid for [[ESL|English as a Second Language]], Basic English has been criticised for the choice of the core vocabulary and for its grammatical constraints.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, by proponents of Essential World English. See [http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm a summary of EWE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818175724/http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }} for instance and, again, the linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, [[readability]] expert [[Rudolf Flesch]] published an article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', "How Basic is Basic English?" in which he claimed, "It's not basic, and it's not English." The essence of his complaint is that the vocabulary is too restricted, and, as a result, the text ends up being awkward and more difficult than necessary. He also argues that the words in the Basic vocabulary were arbitrarily selected, and notes that there had been no empirical studies showing that it made language simpler.&lt;ref name="Flesch"&gt;Flesch, R. F. "How Basic is Basic English?" 'Harper's Magazine'', March 1944. pp.&amp;nbsp;339-343.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', published in 1933, [[H. G. Wells]] depicted Basic English as the [[lingua franca]] of a new elite that after a prolonged struggle succeeds in uniting the world and establishing a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]]. In the future world of Wells' vision, virtually all members of humanity know this language.

From 1942 to 1944 [[George Orwell]] was a proponent of Basic English, but in 1945 he became critical of [[universal language]]s. Basic English later inspired his use of [[Newspeak]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich |first=Ivan |authorlink=Ivan Illich |author2=Barry Sanders |title=ABC: The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind |year=1988 |publisher=[[North Point Press]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |language= |isbn=0-86547-291-2 |pages=109 |quote=The satirical force with which Orwell used Newspeak to serve as his portrait of one of those totalitarian ideas that he saw taking root in the minds of intellectuals everywhere can be understood only if we remember that he speaks with shame about a belief that he formerly held... From 1942 to 1944, working as a colleague of William Empson's, he produced a series of broadcasts to India written in Basic English, trying to use its programmed simplicity, as a ''Tribune'' article put it, 'as a sort of corrective to the oratory of statesmen and publicists.' Only during the last year of the war did he write 'Politics and the English Language,' insisting that the defense of English language has nothing to do with the setting up of a Standard English.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evelyn Waugh]] criticized his own 1945 novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'', which he had previously called his magnum opus, in the preface of the 1959 reprint: "It &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[World War II]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was a bleak period of present privation and threatening disaster—the period of [[soya beans]] and Basic English—and in consequence the book is infused with a kind of gluttony, for food and wine, for the splendours of the recent past, and for rhetorical and ornamental language that now, with a full stomach, I find distasteful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Waugh | first=Evelyn | title=Brideshead Revisited  | location=New York | publisher=Dell | origyear=1946 | year=1959}}. Full [http://www.odysseyeditions.com/EBooks/Evelyn-Waugh/Brideshead-Revisited/Evelyn-Waughs-Author-commentary-for-Brideshead-Revisited preface text] available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his story ''[[Gulf (novella)|Gulf]]'', science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] used a [[constructed language]] called [[Speedtalk]], in which every Basic English word is replaced with a single [[phoneme]], as an appropriate means of communication for a race of genius supermen.&lt;ref&gt;Heinlein, Robert A., ''Gulf'', in ''Assignment in Eternity'', published by Signet Science Fiction (New American Library), 1953. pp. 52–53: "It was possible to establish a one-to-one relationship with Basic English so that ''one phonetic symbol'' was equivalent to an entire word".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Change.org was launched on May 28, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2007/02/07/social-networking-for-change/|title = Social Networking For Change(.org)|author = Gonzalez, Nick|publisher = [[TechCrunch]]|date = February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; by current chief executive [[Ben Rattray]], with the support of founding [[chief technology officer]] Mark Dimas, Darren Haas,&lt;ref name="Veneziani"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/02/07/social-networking-for-change/|title=Social Networking For Change(.org)|first=Vince|last=Veneziani|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date= February 7, 2007|accessdate= December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adam Cheyer]].&lt;ref name="Veneziani"/&gt; As of February 2012, the site had 100 employees with offices on four continents. By the end of 2012, Rattray stated "he plans to have offices in 20 countries and to operate in several more languages, including Arabic and Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/opinion/sunday/kristof-after-recess-change-the-world.html?_r=1|title = 'After Recess - Change the World'|author = [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof, Nicholas]]| work = [[The New York Times]]|date = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, the company announced a $15 million round of investment led by Omidyar Network and said it has 170 staff members in 18 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Empson|first=Rick|title=With $15M From Omidyar And 35M+ Users, Change.org Wants To Prove Socially-Minded Startups Can Attract Big Numbers|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/21/with-15m-from-omidyar-and-35m-users-change-org-wants-to-prove-socially-minded-business-can-attract-big-numbers/|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=TechCrunch|date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Change.org claimed it was the subject of a [[distributed denial of service]] attack by "Chinese hackers",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Branigan|first=Tania|title=Ai Weiwei campaign website 'victim of Chinese hackers'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/20/ai-weiwei-campaign-website-chinese-hackers|work = [[The Guardian]] |date=April 20, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the alleged attack was apparently related to its petition to the [[government of China|Chinese government]] to release artist [[Ai Weiwei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joffe-Walt|first=Benjamin|title=Chinese Hackers Attack Change.org Platform in Reaction to Ai Weiwei Campaign|url=http://blog.change.org/2011/04/chinese-hackers-attack-change-org-platform-in-reaction-to-ai-weiwei-campaign/|publisher=Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there was a proposal to merge the Spanish-speaking counterpart website ''Actuable'' into ''Change.org''. It took place in 2012 when they approved the voluntary union of ''Actuable'' users into the ''Change.org'' platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publico.es/ciencias/397493/actuable-se-fusiona-con-change-org-y-crean-la-mayor-plataforma-de-ciberactivismo-online |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228184822/http://www.publico.es/ciencias/397493/actuable-se-fusiona-con-change-org-y-crean-la-mayor-plataforma-de-ciberactivismo-online |archivedate=2012-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tecnologia.elpais.com/tecnologia/2011/09/20/actualidad/1316509269_850215.html |title=Change.org adquiere la española Actuable &amp;#124; Tecnología &amp;#124; EL PAÍS |publisher=Tecnologia.elpais.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Arizona State University]] decided to block access to Change.org in response to a petition created by student Eric Haywood protesting "rising tuition costs at the school". University officials claimed that "Change.org is a spam site" and the blocking was conducted "to protect the use of our limited and valuable network resources for legitimate academic, research, and administrative uses".&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-levy/arizona-state-censors-cha_b_1253155.html|title = Arizona State Censors Change.org|author = Levy, Josh | work  = [[The Huffington Post]] |date = February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on April 5, 2012, that Change.org hit 10 million members, and was the fastest-growing social action platform on the web. At that time, they were receiving 500 new petitions per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/05/change-org-hits-10-million-members-now-the-fastest-growing-social-action-platform-on-the-web |title=Change.org Hits 10 Million Members, Now The "Fastest-Growing Social Action Platform On The Web" |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2012-04-05 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2012, ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[BBC News]] and other sources reported that Change.org would launch a UK-specific platform for petitions, placing Change.org in competition with [[38 Degrees]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/14/trayvon-epetition-website-changeorg-launches-uk|title = Trayvon Martin petition site Change.org comes to UK| work = [[The Guardian]]|author = Topping, Alexandra |date = May 13, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18033968|title = Change.org petition site targets UK campaigners|author = Kelion, Leo|date = May 14, 2012|publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; a British not-for-profit political-activism organization.

An August 2013 ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'s'' article reported that Change.org would soon begin featuring petition recipients, saying, "For the first time, companies will be able to post a public response to any given petition (currently, they can only respond to the person who started the campaign). They will also be able to create their own Decision Maker page, which will show all petitions against them, the number of signatures gathered, and their statuses." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bluestein|first=Adam|title=HOW BEN RATTRAY'S CHANGE.ORG BECAME A VIRAL CONSUMER WATCHDOG|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3014809/change-org-petitions-ben-rattray|accessdate=7 October 2013|newspaper=Fast Company|date=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 2017, a petition on change.org called for [[/r/incels]] (incel named after an abbreviation for "[[inceldom|involuntary celibate]]") to be banned for inciting violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/incels-reddit-banned.html|title=Reddit Bans 'Incel' Group for Inciting Violence Against Women|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=2017-11-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable petitions==

===In Brazil===
On November 12th, 2018, a petition entitled “Contra o aumento de salário aos ministros do STF” exceed the record of signatures with 2,6 million. Much more than "Aprovem o Pedido de Impeachment da Presidente Dilma" with 2,23 million.

===In the United States===
On March 8, 2012, a petition entitled "Prosecute the killer of our son, 17-year-old [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin]]" was posted on Change.org. The petition received over 2.2 million signatures – at that time the largest number of signatures for any campaign in Change.org's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.change.org/petitions/prosecute-the-killer-of-our-son-17-year-old-trayvon-martin|title = Prosecute the killer of our son, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin|publisher = Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition called for the prosecution of [[George Zimmerman]], a neighborhood watch volunteer, who, on February 26, 2012, shot and killed Trayvon Martin in [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]], [[Florida]], a suburb of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. Zimmerman said he was acting in self-defense, and was set free without being charged. On April 11, 2012, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He stood trial in the months of June and July and was acquitted of all charges on July 13, 2013.

On October 1, 2011, Molly Katchpole, a "22 year old nanny with two jobs" in [[Washington D.C.]], started a petition on Change.org "asking [[Bank of America]] and their CEO Bryan Moynihan to drop its unexpected new $5/month banking fee" for debit card customers. Less than one month later, 300,000 signatures were collected. The petition was widely cited as a contributing cause for the bank formally announcing to drop the new banking fee. [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] signed the petition; [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Dick Durbin]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[senator from Illinois]], responded to Bank of America and the petition on [[Twitter]]. It may have contributed to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] deciding to "look at legislation for out-of-control banking fees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-bank-of-america-no-5-debit-card-fees|title = Tell Bank of America: No $5 Debit Card Fees|publisher = Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, a fourth-grade class in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]], launched the "Lorax Petition Project" through Change.org requesting [[Universal Studios]] to include more of an environmental message on its website and trailer for its upcoming film, ''[[The Lorax (film)|The Lorax]]'', a classic [[Dr. Seuss]] children's story. The website and trailer lacked the important message from the book, "to help the environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.change.org/petitions/z-let-the-lorax-speak-for-the-trees|title = 'Universal Pictures: Let the Lorax Speak for the Trees!'|publisher = Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition collected over 57,000 signatures, and on January 26, 2012, the studio updated the website "with the environmental message the kids had requested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/opinion/sunday/kristof-after-recess-change-the-world.html?_r=1|title = After Recess - Change the World|author = [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof, Nicholas]] | work = [[The New York Times]]|date = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of February 2, 2012, Stef Gray, a 23-year-old graduate in New York, held a news conference at the Washington offices of Sallie Mae where she presented the results of her Change.org, [[Sallie Mae]], the "nation's largest private student-loan provider" petition, which had received about 77,000 signers. That afternoon the company changed its forbearance fee policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Lewin, Tamar|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/education/sallie-mae-to-change-forbearance-fee-policy.html?_r=3|title = Sallie Mae to Change Forebearance Fee Policy | work = [[The New York Times]]|date = February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, someone calling himself "[[John Doe]]" of [[Arlington, Texas]] launched a petition against changes made to the [[YouTube]] commenting system by [[Google]]. The changes force YouTube users to create an account on [[Google+]] and also removes the "reply" mechanism on comments unless they were posted on Google+. This petition received over 100,000 signatures in less than a week, and over 200,000 within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1q92rm/google_change_the_youtube_comment_section_back_to/|publisher=Reddit|title=Change the Youtube comment section back to its original form|year=2013|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition garnered more than 241,000 signatures, but failed to change Google's stance on the matter. However, the changes to YouTube did not have the intended effect &amp;ndash; namely, increasing spam instead of curbing it &amp;ndash; and in mid-2015, the commenting system was altered to allow users to post comments without signing into Google+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33687110 |title =Google unlinking Google+ from YouTube|work =BBC News |location=London |date =July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Change.org makes revenue through a subscription membership model, people promoting petitions on the site, and crowdfunding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/why-change-org-s-army-of-davids-is-neutering-more-global-goliaths-20180228-p4z24h.html|title=Why Change.org's Army of Davids is Neutering More Global Goliaths|last=Bryant|first=Nick|date=3 March 2018|website=smh.com.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change.org members contribute monthly to sustain the technology and the small teams of campaigners who coach and support petition starters. The majority of the company's revenue is advertising - individuals and organisations who start or sign petitions then chip in to promote those petitions to other site visitors.

To date, Change.org has raised $50 million to fuel its growth from mission-aligned investors in business, technology and the media. In 2017 an investment round driven by [[Reid Hoffman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/05/26/reid-hoffman-change-org/|title=LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman Invests Big Change In Change.org|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped drive the shift to the current business model.

The website previously made revenue by running advertisements called sponsored campaigns for advocacy organizations such as [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mui|first=Ylan M|title=Change.org Emerges as Influential Advocate on Issues from Bullying to Bank Fees|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/changeorg-emerges-as-influential-advocate/2012/01/09/gIQAoCJHLQ_story.html| work = [[The Washington Post]]|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and list-building services to partner organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Martin, Courtney E. |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/164338/you-are-now-now-future-online-feminism|title= 'You Are the NOW of Now!' The Future of (Online) Feminism| work =[[The Nation]]|date= November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2013 the website started "crowd-promoted petitions" that allowed a signatory to promote the petition by paying $5 to $1000 at the final stage of petition signing.

==Criticism==

===Fake Signatures===
Massive Australian based anti-cycling petition is full of false names, claims Bicycle Queensland CEO. Anne Savage said the body had received information that many of the names were created by electronic “bots”. “We have evidence that the majority of names on that petition are false names,” she said.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/massive-anticycling-petition-full-of-false-names-claims-bicycle-queensland-ceo/news-story/fdf3e0dd06aa3343948dce1020df03b1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visibility of personal information===
Under certain conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Policy {{!}} Change.org|url=http://www.change.org/about/privacy|publisher=Change.org|accessdate= March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=January 2015}} signatures and other private information including email addresses can be found by search engines. Change.org operates a system for signature hiding, which works only if the user has an account on Change.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I want my name off of this petition immediately! : The Change.org Help Desk|url=http://helpdesk.change.org/entries/20272227-i-want-my-name-off-of-this-petition-immediately|publisher=Change.org|accessdate= March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the platform has been criticized for not providing enough information on who has signed a petition; for instance a means of verifying that a petition protesting a politician has been signed by his or her constituents or that the signatures are genuine at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-29/change-org-is-amplifying-the-power-of-a-signature|title=Change.org Is Amplifying the Power of a Signature|first=Sarah|last=Issenberg|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2015-05-29|accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate structure===
There has been debate and criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Change.org about Real Change or Just Pocket Change? |url=http://chieforganizer.org/2012/06/20/is-change-org-about-real-change-or-just-pocket-change/

The site has been accused of fooling its users and hiding the fact that it is "a for-profit entity that has an economic incentive to get people to sign petitions".

{{quote|text=Change.org is being deliberately deceitful through the use of the change.org name. I'd suspect that the average change.org user does not know that Change.org is a for-profit corporation, and that the corporation plans on using the contact information being provided to them to earn revenue.|sign=[[Clay Johnson (technologist)|Clay Johnson]]&lt;ref name="changebiz"/&gt;}}

Change.org spokesperson Charlotte Hill countered this criticism in a September 2013 article in ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'', saying, "We are a mission-driven social enterprise, and while we bring in revenue, we reinvest 100% of that revenue back into our mission of empowering ordinary people. It's not just that we're not yet making a profit – it's that we are decidedly not for-profit." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klint|first=Finley|title=Meet Change.org, the Google of Modern Politics|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/09/change-org/|accessdate=7 October 2013|newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising policy===
In 2012, the site dropped most of the restrictions it previously placed on paid content. Internal documents began referring to "clients" and "partners" as "advertisers" and stated that "only advertisers strictly identified as 'hate groups' are to be barred."&lt;ref name="kos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/23/1149092/-Change-org-sells-out-progressive-movement|title=Change.org sells out progressive movement|first=Raven|last=Brooks|publisher=Daily Kos|date=2012-10-23|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karoli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/why-i-will-not-sign-another-changeorg-petit|title=Why I Will Not Sign Another Change.org Petition Ever|publisher=[[Crooks and Liars]]|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Change.org was accused of encouraging [[astroturfing]] and abandoning the progressive user base from which it initially gained traction. Additional controversy arose when the employee who initially leaked the documents was fired.&lt;ref name="karoli" /&gt; Of the users who lost interest in the site after this change, a number of them expressed difficulty in being removed from Change.org mailing lists.&lt;ref name="kos" /&gt;

===Selling of personal data===
Change.org has also been accused of selling the personal data provided by the users to third-party companies that hire its services, gaining money at the expense of the users.&lt;ref name="changebiz"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3280">'''Clymer repair manuals''' are vehicle repair manuals that often focus on powersport vehicles such as [[motorcycles]], [[all-terrain vehicles]], [[personal water craft]] and [[snowmobiles]]. Clymer also has several books dedicated to small engines and "outdoor power equipment" such as [[leaf blower]]s, [[chainsaws]] and other lawn and garden power equipment.

Clymer repair manuals are named after their creator [[Floyd Clymer]], who is described in the [[Motorcycle Hall of Fame]] as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"a pioneer in the sport of motorcycling. He was a racer, a motorcycle dealer and distributor, a magazine publisher, a racing promoter, an author and a motorcycle manufacturer."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clymer repair manuals are categorized as an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] product or non-OEM. Unlike [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] manuals, Clymer repair manuals are written specifically for the [[do it yourself]] as well as the professional and experienced mechanic. OEM manuals are often designed for a professional technician, who often has at their disposal an array of specialized tools, equipment and knowledge.

One valuable step in the creation process of a Clymer repair manuals is the complete disassembly and reassembly of the machine. This helps the writers for Clymer provide easy-to-follow instructions that allow the manual user to safely and efficiently service and repair their machine. This high level of detail sets Clymer apart from its factory "OEM" counterparts.

In 2013, [[Haynes Manual|Haynes Publishing Group]] acquired Clymer repair manuals from [[Penton Media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foliomag.com/2013/ubm-sells-second-property-week UBM Sells Second Property This Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturers covered==

Clymer currently has over three hundred repair manuals that cover thousands of models. Some of the most popular models are the Honda TRX ATVs, International Harvester Farm Tractors, BMW K1200 Series, Harley-Davidson FLH &amp; FLT Twin Cam 88 &amp; 103 models and the MerCruiser Stern Drive Marine Engines.

'''Collaborative journalism''' is a mode of [[journalism]] where multiple [[reporters]] or news organizations, without affiliation to a common parent organization, report on and contribute [[news]] items to a news story together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novin|first=Alamir|date=17 August 2013|title=DEBATECITED: An empirical experiment into the value of open-source research methods and peer collaboration to science journalism|url=http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/977526/4/DEBATECITED_A1b.pdf|journal=Spectrum. Masters thesis, Concordia University.|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is practiced by both professional and amateur reporters. It is not to be mixed up with [[citizen journalism]].

==Further definition==

Collaborative journalism involves the aggregation of information from numerous individuals or organizations into a single news story.  Information is gathered through research or reporting, or added when readers examine, comment and build upon existing stories.  Stories from the [[mainstream]] media are often built upon.  Depending on the system of collaboration, individuals may also provide [[feedback]] or [[vote]] on whether an article is newsworthy.  A single collaborative news story, therefore, may encompass multiple authors, varying articles, and ranged perspectives.&lt;ref name=CCJ&gt;Whatis.com "[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid26_gci1090596,00.html What is collaborative citizen journalism?]" 2006, ''TechTarget''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional]] and [[amateur]] reporters may work together to develop collaborative news articles, or mainstream media sites may gather amateur blog posts to complement reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Instablogs "[http://www.instablogs.com/tour/ Instablogs Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307204057/http://www.instablogs.com/tour/ |date=2009-03-07 }}" 2007, ''Instablogs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative journalists either contribute directly to stories, sometimes through a wiki-style collaboration platform, or build upon the story externally, often through personal blogs.  Collaborative journalists develop or examine a story one piece at a time.  This contrasts the [[time limit|deadline]] and completion-centered nature of [[traditional media]].  A story is built upon continually, and a popular story may receive daily updates.&lt;ref name=CCJ/&gt;  Through combined authorship, collaborative journalism is thought by some to offer an increased independence of thought and experience unavailable to traditional media.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Stelter, Brian. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13reach.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Mainstream%20News%20Outlets%20Start%20Linking%20to%20Other%20Sites&amp;st=cse Mainstream News Outlets Start Linking to Other Sites]" 12 October 2008, ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful collaborative journalism projects require a participatory community with respect for content.  Ross Mayfield, CEO of SocialText, has commented on wiki-style collaborative journalism:&lt;ref name="Glaser"&gt;Glaser, Mark.  "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1094678265.php Collaborative Conundrum: Do Wikis Have a Place in the Newsroom?]" 2004, ''USC Annenberg: Online Journalism Review''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Most user-generated content isn't content, but conversation.  Cultivating community is a decided practice. It boils down to the social contract you make with your readers-turned-writers. If they trust that their effort and words will be appropriated appropriately, while providing social incentives for participation, it can very well work."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

Collaborative journalism emerged through the [[internet]] in the early 2000s, and developed gradually through various online outlets.  As examples, [[Wikinews]] was founded in 2003, and [[NewsVine]] in 2005.

===Panama Papers===
The [[Panama Papers]] project may be the largest example of a journalistic consortium to date. It began sometime in 2015 (date?) when [[Bastian Obermayer]], an investigative reporter with the south German newspaper [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], was contacted by an anonymous source&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/media/how-a-cryptic-message-interested-in-data-led-to-the-panama-papers.html|title=How a Cryptic Message, ‘Interested in Data?,’ Led to the Panama Papers|last=Clark|first=Nicola|date=2016-04-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered the trove of 11.5 million electronic documents from [[Mossack Fonseca]], the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm detailing a web of secret offshore deals and loans worth billions of dollars, and details of tax avoidance designs in numerous countries. The newspaper's editors decided they could not handle the massive volume of information alone and initiated a collaborative journalistic consortium including more than 140 journalists and the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]], a project of the [[nonprofit]] [[Center for Public Integrity]].

==Football Leaks (2016/2017)==
{{main|Football Leaks}}
The [[European Investigative Collaborations]] (EIC) working with "over 60 journalists in 14 countries" published a "series of articles called ''Football Leaks''—the "largest leak in sports history".&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/?idT=3&amp;idC=3 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |location=Bucharest, Romania |year=2017 |publisher=The Black Sea |title=Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Football Leaks'' "led to the prosecution of football superstar [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and coach [[Jose Mourinho]]."&lt;ref name="horizont_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.horizont.net/medien/nachrichten/Investigativjournalismus-Spiegel-schafft-ressortuebegreifendes-Recherchenetzwerk-160100 |title=Spiegel schafft multimediales Recherchenetzwerk |first=von Hein |last=David Hein |location=Freitag |date=August 4, 2017 |access-date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; EIC was established in the fall of 2015 with founding members that include ''Der Spiegel'', ''El Mundo'', ''Médiapart'', the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism (CRJI), and ''Le Soir''.&lt;ref name="EU_gov_Rengers_EIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/127803/5%20-%2001%20On%20Football%20Leaks%20-%20speaking%20notes%20Merijn%20Rengers.pdf |format=PDF |title=On Football Leaks Speaking notes |first=Merijn |last=Rengers |agency=European Parliament |series=Speaking notes}}NRC Handelsblad, Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="journalismfund_2016_EIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalismfund.eu/news/%E2%80%9Csome-stories-can-get-killed-without-right-network%E2%80%9D |title=Some stories can get killed without the right network |date=March 30, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |publisher=Journalism Fund formerly Fonds Pascal Decroos voor Bijzondere Journalistiek vzw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2016_EU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1230&amp;recType=multimedia |title=EU’s freedom of goods policy opened door to Paris terror attacks |date=March 18, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |publisher=The Black Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiation from other styles of journalism==

*Collaborative journalism should not be confused with [[citizen journalism]], which is practiced only by amateur reporters who develop stories by actively reporting, collecting, analyzing and disseminating news and information, often through [[blog]]s on the internet.
*It is not [[community journalism]] or [[Civic Journalism|civic journalism]], which are practiced only by professionals:
**In [[community journalism]], professional reporters focus their coverage on smaller communities, such as neighborhoods, suburbs, or small towns (rather than national or international coverage.)
**[[Civic Journalism|Civic journalism]] is the philosophy and practice of professional journalists and newspapers acting as participants within a community, rather than detached spectators.
*Collaborative journalism is similar, but not identical, to [[interactive journalism]], in which consumers contribute to a professional news story through commenting and conversing with the reporter.
*[[Wiki journalism]]  is a type of collaborative journalism.

==Link journalism==

"[[Link journalism]]", a phrase coined by Scott Karp in 2008, is "a form of collaborative journalism in which a news story's writer provides external [[hyperlink|links]] within the story to reporting or other sources on the web."&lt;ref name="Karp"&gt;Karp, Brian. "[http://publishing2.com/2008/02/25/how-link-journalism-could-have-transformed-the-new-york-times-reporting-on-mccain-ethics/ How Link Journalism Could Have Transformed the New York Times Reporting on McCain Ethics]" 2008, ''Publish 2.0 Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link Journalism"&gt;Publish2 "[http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism What is link journalism?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312060206/http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism |date=2009-03-12 }}" 2009, ''Publish2''.&lt;/ref&gt;    These links are meant to complement, enhance, or add context to the original reporting.  [[Jeff Jarvis]], from the Graduate School of Journalism's new media program at the [[City University of New York]], has said that link journalism creates a "new architecture of news."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Implementation==

Collaborative journalism has been implemented in several different ways.  [[Wikinews]], the "free-content online news source," lets any user edit or create a news story, similar in style to [[Wikipedia]].  Several mainstream news sites have adopted a collaborative journalism approach toward news, through use of news aggregation.  [[The Washington Post]] has developed a political site which links to related content from other news sites.  [[NBC]] links to local newspapers, radio broadcasts, online videos, and blogs on its local television stations' sites.  The sites do not separate articles written by NBC staff and links to outside sources.
[[The New York Times]] has introduced a ''Times Extra'' website feature which acts posts links to outside news sites.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;   Commenting on the launch of ''Times Extra'', [[Marc Frons]], CTO for Digital Operations at the New York Times, said:&lt;ref name="Frons"&gt;Frons, Marc. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/business/media/28askthetimes.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1217599487-JcYF6S4d34UK1ZlCsX04OA Talk to the Times: Chief Technology Officer, Digital Operations]" 2008, ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“In the past, I think many news organizations were afraid to link to other Web sites out of fear that they might be sending people to an unreliable source or that their readers would never return. But those fears were largely misplaced and we’ve seen a much more open policy when it comes to pointing readers at useful content elsewhere on the Web."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other sites exhibit collaborative journalism through aggregation.  On the site [[NewsVine]], for example, wire stories from the Associated Press complement user-generated stories and blog posts.  [[Reddit]] and other news aggregation sites may also act as collaborative journalism sites, depending on where content originates.

== Awards for collaborative journalism ==
Due to the increase in collaborative journalism, several organizations have begun to offer grants or awards for these types of projects. For example, Online Journalism Awards (launched in May 2000) added a new award category for collaborations and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://awards.journalists.org/2018/05/02/2018-online-journalism-awards-introduce-new-collaboration-category-among-changes/|title="2018 OJAs introduce new Collaboration category, among other changes"|last=|first=|date=|website=Online Journalism Awards|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clean Energy Wire offers grants for collaborative journalism projects on the topic of energy or the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleanenergywire.org/grant-collaborative-journalism-for-global-energy-transition|title="Go collaborate! Grant for energy &amp; climate journalism."|last=|first=|date=|website=Clean Energy Wire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual Hostwriter Prize awards money to support pitches and published collaborative projects by journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hostwriter.org/sites/prize/|title="Hostwriter Prize: Together for better journalism"|last=|first=|date=|website=Hostwriter|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Collaborative journalism has received some criticism:
*Some news stories require secrecy as they develop.  Often sources cannot know that they are being investigated or reported on. When a single reporter investigates a person or organization, this secrecy is more likely to be kept.  When news stories are developed collaboratively by multiple journalists, however, secrecy is more likely to be lost and the story jeopardized.&lt;ref name=DigiDave&gt;"[http://www.digidave.org/2009/03/collaboration-is-queen.html Collaboration is Queen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090817232727/http://www.digidave.org/2009/03/collaboration-is-queen.html |date=2009-08-17 }}" 2009, ''DigiDave.org''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Quality of collaborative projects may be difficult to assess.  Fact-checking may be difficult, as facts come from many different sources.  Quality of writing and reporting may also differ among contributors.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;Haber, Marlan Wynne "[http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1026359737.html%3Bjsessionid=E02C44EA6326406DD8BB63E7C014ABC7.ehctc1 Strategies of Collaborative Writing and Intellectual Enrichment.]" 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[digital divide]]''' is an [[economic inequality|economic]] and [[social inequality]] with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="NTIA95"&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). (1995). ''Falling through the net: A survey of the ''have nots'' in rural and urban America''. Retrieved from, http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors causing the divide can vary depending on the country and culture, as can the potential solutions for minimizing or closing the divide.

The following is a list of countries that have a digital divide along with contributing factors and steps the country is taking to resolve the issue.

== Argentina ==
{{see also|Internet in Argentina}}

The digital divide in Argentina is the term used to describe the technological and connectivity gap between different demographics and regions, specifically the gaps present in the country of Argentina. The availability and access to the Internet in Argentina shows how the trends of a digital divide stay constant, even across different countries and cultures. Age is one of the main factors, and Argentina's statistics show a common disparity between ages. According to TNS Infratest, the age group with the highest rate of daily internet users in 2016 were users under 25. 91% of that age demographic were polled as being daily internet users. In contrast, the age group with the lowest rate were users over 55, with only 68% of that demographic being daily internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/339986/daily-internet-usage-age-group-argentina/|title=Daily internet usage in Argentina by age group 2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older one is, the less likely they are to use Internet, and these statistics reflect that. The way that users are able to access the Internet can also show the status of Internet and how easily one can utilize it. In Argentina, 48% of users preferred to use a smartphone or tablet to a computer, 29% used them equally, and 16% preferred a computer to a smartphone or tablet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/370255/preferred-devices-for-internet-access-argentina/|title=Preferred devices for internet access in Argentina 2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education ===
The quality of life in Argentina is among one of the highest in South and Latin America, according to InterNations. The children are well educated in school, and they are given numerous opportunities to pursue afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internations.org/argentina-expats/guide/living-in-argentina-15328/education-in-argentina-3|title=Education in Argentina|website=www.internations.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government created a project named "Conectar Igualdad" (Connecting Equality) where they distribute netbooks to students and teachers in primary school, special needs schools, and state institutes. Since the project began nearly 4,000,000 netbooks have been dispersed amongst them to 400 different schools and 7,500 different teachers. The program works in three parts: an internet connection to Wi-Fi, an established internet connection through a reliable network (giving students Internet access anywhere, even at home), and making use of a syntonizer for Digital TV, allowing students access to interactive live programs. In 2011, the Government launched another program named "Escuelas de Innovacion" (Schools of Innovation). The main goal is to guarantee students better access to education and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalstatement.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/argentina-projects-encouraging-digital-education/|title=Argentina: Projects encouraging digital education|date=2014-09-22|work=Global Statement: A blog of the Swiss ERI-Network|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Argentina creates new and innovative projects each year for students and teachers to have greater access to the Internet. It plays an important role in their education and is a great opportunity for students and teachers to close the gap in the digital divide.

== Africa ==
Immorality and ICT holds are the major contributor to stunt in Africa's development. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Digital divide in South Africa|date=2018-11-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Digital_divide_in_South_Africa&amp;oldid=868438353|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geography factor focuses more on how an individuals' location put them at an advantage or disadvantage to compete with the digital age. However, only a handful on people and communities are being represented. Underdeveloped geographical locations, like the continent of Africa serves as one of the underrepresented minorities. In a study conducted in 2011, they estimate that internet access is only available to roughly fourteen percent of the African population.&lt;sup&gt;[[Internet in Africa#cite note-8|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This means that while the world’s population is only composed of fifteen percent of Africans, around six percent of that subscribe to the internet. &lt;sup&gt;[[Internet in Africa#cite note-WorldStats-9|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;   

== Bangladesh ==
{{see also|Internet in Bangladesh}}

The digital divide in Bangladesh is a gap in the population of Arshads who can access [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] ([[Information and communications technology|ICTs]]) and those without proper access or skills.&lt;ref name="Rahman"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Anisur|date=Fall 2017|title=Access to Global Information - A case of Digital Divide in Bangladesh|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1819&amp;context=iatul|journal=Information Development|volume= 32| issue = 1|pages= 5|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government and Community  ===
{{Main|Government of Bangladesh}}

Information and communication technologies use in Bangladesh began to grow in 2005 with the introduction of [[Free trade|market liberalization]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rashid|first=Ahmed Tareq|date=Winter 2017|title=Inclusive Capitalism and Development: Case Studies of Telecenters Fostering Inclusion through ICTs in Bangladesh|url=http://www.itidjournal.org/index.php/itid/article/view/1427|journal=Information Technologies &amp; International Development|volume= 13|pages= 14|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has been trying to help increase ICT availability to all Bangladeshis by reducing taxes on the [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] and creating special projects to support the spread of ICTs.&lt;ref name="Rahman" /&gt; In 2006 the largest mobile phone company in Bangladesh, GrameenPhone Ltd, introduced Community Information Centers (CICs), which are each equipped with two computers, printers, digital cameras and web cameras that can be used by the community.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; "There are over 500 CICs operating in 450 subdistricts in Bangladesh".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Within the community, there is research suggesting that men benefit more from ICTs than women due to Bangladesh's gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hossain|first=Sarah|last2=Beresford|first2=Melanie|date=Winter 2012|title=Paving the pathway for women’s empowerment?

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in Bangladesh}}
The education system in Bangladesh is divided up into three stages of schooling: primary school, secondary school, and a level of more formal education. Primary school lasts for five years for children aged 6 to 10, secondary school lasts for seven years, and the formal education level can last anywhere from two to six years. Government policies have been implanted since 2000 that has caused the [[Information technology|Information Technology (IT)]] industry to grow in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shinkai|first=Naoko|last2=Hossain|first2=Monzur|date=June 2011|title=Productivity and Performance of IT Sector in Bangladesh: Evidence from the Firm Level Data|jstor=23339841|journal=The Bangladesh Development Series|volume=34|issue=2|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students started going to school in order to become a part of this growing workforce, taking lessons in English language, analytical thinking, and software development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The youth of Bangladesh are becoming educated in the technology available, which is a step in ending Bangladesh’s part in the global digital divide. A country can have access to technology but if the people do not understand how to use the technology than there is no difference between having it or not. Satisfaction and gratification from using the technology are key points in bridging the gap because the sense of accomplishment give the people confidence to use the technology.

== Canada ==
{{Main|Digital divide in Canada}}
{{see also|Internet in Canada}}

The digital divide in Canada is impacted by several factors that include the differences in the availability of online connectivity resources in different locations across the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CRTC|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/policymonitoring/2015/cmr2.htm|title=Communications Monitoring Report 2015: Canada's Communications System: An Overview for Citizens, Consumers, and Creators|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Government of Canada CRTC|publisher=|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; levels of [[digital literacy]], and economic levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last1=Rajabiun|first1=Reza|last2=Ellis|first2=David|last3=Middleton|first3=Catherine|title=Literature Review: Affordability of Communications Services|url=http://www.ryerson.ca/~cmiddlet/ourresearch/lit-review-for-crtc-2016-affordability-rajabiun-ellis-middleton.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2016|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites in which allow for the regular and free interaction between Chinese citizens, generally come with some restrictions. This will include social media sites, forums, and other sites which are heavy on user interactivity. Google has also been heavily restricted in China and this includes all of its different features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4707107&amp;page=1|title='Hacktivists' Fight China's Web Censors|last=News|first=A.

== Colombia ==
{{see also|Internet in Colombia}}
The digital divide in Colombia refers to the absence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and how it affects Colombian individuals and its society as a whole. The main lapse of technology and information lies in the physical access realm of things, where it is lacking tremendously. Though Internet in Colombia has made progress compared to recent years, the scholary part of how ICTs are used are still in question. With this being said, government officials have made certain that access to ICTs be a priority in their country. In addition to physical access, literature review and types of internet use have also been main points of focus in regards to a solution for digital divide in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velasquez|first1=Alcides|title=Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs|journal=International Journal of Communication|date=2013|volume=7|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/download/2180/969|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of Internet Use (ICT) ===
There is a difference between material or physical access and actual use of ICTs. "According to Hargittai (2008),
differences in the uses of ICTs have important implications for life outcomes". "Rojas and Puig-i-abril (2009) found that the most prevalent activities of Internet users in Colombia were checking e-mail, consuming entertainment content, chatting with friends, and consuming news and information." There are different levels of "use" including, non-use, low use, and frequent use while also taking into consideration the opportunities taken by the users. There is a difference in those who go online just for fun and those who use the internet for the improvement of themselves. 
(International Journal of Communication (19328036)) (Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velasquez|first1=Alcides|date=2013|title=Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=f151dc7b-5ad1-4f82-9162-8ebbbbc6f443%40sessionmgr101&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=99140318|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=7|pages=1768–1783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical Access ===
One digital divide study displayed physical access as "having"/"not having" access to the internet. Those who are less fortunate have been shown to lack educational advantage, due to the fact of not having access to internet as common as those who are more fortunate in wealth. Communities that are more technological advanced offers their communities to expand their knowledge and be able to communicate with other worlds. The intellectual advantage is common for countries, such as Colombia, where the poor communities are lacking the opportunities offered to those who are on the other side of town with more advantage. Poor communities are focusing on trying to make ends meet, and working hard labor without being offered to make a change to better themselves. The internet plays an important role in this, due to the fact that the internet provides opportunities to explore new jobs and to widen individuals' knowledge. In certain areas where the communities are wealthy, the internet is provided at the access of their hands. Being able to access the internet so easily, gives privileged individuals the chance to go beyond their expectations and get their point out into the world.

=== Causes of the Digital Divide in Colombia ===
There is no singular cause of the Digital Divide in Colombia. A number of different factors each contribute to the variance of access to technology within Colombia. These factors include location, economic class, education, and others.

In Colombia, those located in large cities are 69% more likely to use the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Velasquez|first=Alcides|date=January 2013|title=Digital Divide in Colombia|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=aa35d002-0e64-4818-aae4-32e576e1d4cb@sessionmgr4007|journal=International Journal of Communication (19328036)|volume=1768|pages=1772–1776|via=Discovery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high correlation between the use of ICTs and location in large industrial cities is one of the most visible examples of digital divide in Colombia. People located in rural parts of Colombia are significantly less likely to use ICTs and the internet regularly for various reasons. One leading cause is simply because people living in rural parts of the country tend to be less educated which is negatively correlated with technology use. The pastoral parts of Colombia are often much less developed than the large cities. Often, these rustic areas lack the technology and internet providers needed to further bridge the digital divide between large and small cities. A study of the Digital Divide in Colombia concerning residency included a population in which 21.6% of respondents lived in a small or medium-sized city (&lt;1,000,000 inhabitants), while 78.4% lived in larger urban centers. This study showed that the vast majority of ICT usage occurred in large urban areas.

==== Technology Amongst Different Ideals and its Effect on the Economy====
The importance of technology and its relationship with economic development was synthesized by Solow (1987a) when he stated that “technology remains the dominant engine of growth, with human capital investment in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solow|first1=R.M.|title=Growth Theory and After|publisher=Stockholm|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=96960681&amp;S=R&amp;D=zbh&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA}}&lt;/ref&gt;” Concerning economic development and moves to improve it, it is an understood phenomena that countries with the highest availability and use of technology are the countries with the best economies. Technology has not advanced in all societies as far as many thought it would be according to today’s societal expectations. This lack of advancement mainly occurs in communities or organizations whose organizational context differentiates from a more skillful and high value profile to a context of autonomy. “In non-industrial contexts, non-computerized societies and organizations maintain more traditional routines, because they simultaneously face the absorption of techniques and instruments, while copying their preexisting idiosyncrasies, environments, and routines. In these cases change is perceived as expensive, time consuming and risky, producing sentiments that facilitate phobic, indifferent or stereotyped attitudes towards technology”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zapata|first1=Cristian|title=The Digital Divide in the University: The Appropriation of ICT in Higher Education Students from Bogota, Colombia|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=96960681&amp;S=R&amp;D=zbh&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA|website=Media Educacion Research|publisher=Comunicar|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These preconceptions towards technology play a small role in the digital divide in Colombia. Among society’s who are not on the same accord in regards to technology and its benefits, attitudes towards technology show a distinct display of the amount of technological dependence a community has.

====Cultural Preservation vs. Cultural Modernization====
The two ideas of cultural preservation and cultural modernization create a divide amongst the world of industry and the world of agriculture. The industry field often involves research and development. Societies involving research and development often require skill in many different areas with products that's value is highly regarded. Both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the products creates a need for enhanced work material, which oftentimes is the latest and fastest technology. Industrially, in Colombia this is understood and industries strive, strengthening the different industries and corporations all over Colombia. Colombia’s somewhat, partial digital divide stems from areas of Colombia where locals are resistant to change. In 2003, Avgerou found this resistance to change to be due to the uncertainties of technology among the rural population. Gille referred to what was called the Technological System. This idea of Gilles suggested that technology would eventually transform social life all together by connecting technologies and everyday productive routines. Communities often adopt things that are for the betterment of the entire community. Rural populations and communities are often close knit and every one often shares the same views. The idea of technology is not necessarily one that everyone is going to agree with, especially when a community has done with out considerable updates to their prior owned technology for a long period of time. People admire their culture and want to see that it stay the same, with no flaws or inconsistencies. If the technological system adopted by the community is inconsistent or non-competitive, the host is limited by these gaps and builds and inefficient technical rationality.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The combination of reverence of community and culture, and possibilities of technological gaps delays technological advancement into many developing communities and this creates a digital divide. While information technology is thriving in the developed parts of Colombia with industries and corporations using it to their economic advantage, the rural and developing side of Colombia still has some ground to cover. This delayed progress of information technology can be mended through information technology programs that teach and enable developing communities how to use technology. Progress can also be made through built trust and reassurance through the government about modernized technology.

====Information Technology in Education====
Education is oftentimes viewed as the most important aspect of a society. The relationship between quantitative and qualitative productions of learning and the effort invested in the process, measured with respect to the goals set by the educative institution, the available resources and the needs from the environment, educational productivity is defined. Though education levels tend to depend largely on strength of the governments economy, other factors, including educational programs and community involvement can have an impactful effect. The country of Colombia is primarily rural and is mainly represented by remote areas. The general population of Colombia perceives the Internet as not useful and the purchasing power of Colombians is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2013/GITR_Chapter2.1_2013.pdf|title=Colombia's Digital Agenda: Successes and the Challenges Ahead|last1=Vega|first1=Diego|publisher=Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies of Colombia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This displays that access to technology is not necessarily essential and, or available. Communities from developing territories end up producing superficial changes in their tortuous transition to the new ICT paradigm, unable to keep up the pace in developing computer skills. The problem is not just the access to tools; it includes the construction of a compatible social, cultural and economic logic (Avgerou, 2003), that, due to the resistance to change from some of the local stakeholders, turns into a complex and slow process.&lt;ref name="Information Systems Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00095.x).|title=The Significance of Context in Information Systems and Organizational Change|last1=Avgerou|first1=C.|website=The Link between ICT and Economic Growth in the Discourse of Development|publisher=Springer|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves sacrificing some of the distinctive particularities of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=96960681&amp;S=R&amp;D=zbh&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA|title=The Digital Divide in the University: The Appropriation of ICT in Higher Education Students from Bogota, Colombia|last1=Zapata|first1=Cristian|website=Media Educación Research Journal|publisher=Comunicar|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Solutions to Digital Divide in Education ====
The CPE (Country Program Evaluation) allows the transfer of technology to rural areas to be a much smoother one by training teachers to properly use technological information. This knowledge is taken by teachers and aimed to increase levels of incorporation, adaptation, and integration of technologies as required for achievement of sustainable growth in Colombia, ensuring increased productivity and competitiveness while consolidating the quality of the Colombian educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2013/GITR_Chapter2.1_2013.pdf|title=Colombia's Digital Agenda: Successes and the Challengers Ahead|last1=Vega|first1=Diego|publisher=Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies of Colombia|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Colombia’s information technology presence in public schools are relatively normal. Areas of Colombia where poor educational infrastructure is combined with an economy focused on natural resources and its exploitation, are areas with school systems that focus on technical training concerning the production of basic goods rather than long term knowledge and innovation skills. In regards to higher education and universities in Colombia information technology infrastructure is growing at an alarming rate. From possessing updated technology in the classroom to technological information possessed by those in charge, ICT’s (Information Communication Technology) in the Colombian school system is currently at paramount.

=== Bridging The Digital  Divide ===

====Government Involvement====
In 2010, President Juan Manuel Santos launched ''Vive Digital,'' a government initiative aimed to create jobs, improve economic growth and development, and—most importantly—reduce poverty. ''Vive Digital'' does this all through the embracing of financial opportunities rooted in the production and utilization of technology. Within the past four years, Vive Digital has changed the digital landscape in Colombia. The largest impact has been on the poorest citizens. Colombia has gone from 3.1 million Internet broadband connections in 2010 to 9.9 million in mid-2014, and Internet penetration for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) increased from 7 percent in 2010 to more than 60 percent in 2014. Another initiative the Colombian government has served the people of Colombia with is the National Broadband Policy of the Ministerio de Tecnologías de la Información y las Comunicaciones (Ministry of Information Technology and Communications) which has increased the percentage of Colombian municipalities connected to the Internet from 17 percent in 2010 to 96 percent today.&lt;ref name="America's Quarterly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vega|first1=Diego Molano|title=Colombia's Internet Advantage|url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/colombias-internet-advantage|website=America's Quarterly|publisher=AMERICAS SOCIETY/ COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"By 2018, the government hopes to have 63 percent of the country connected to broadband. And according to 2013 GSMA mobile economy figures, there are already 43.9 million mobile connections and 24 million mobile users in a country whose 47 million people give it the third largest population in Latin America and third largest Spanish-speaking population in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Egusa|first1=Conrad|title=Colombia Is One Of Latin America’s Most Promising New Tech Hubs|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/22/an-overview-of-colombia-one-of-latin-americas-most-promising-new-tech-hubs/|website=techcrunch.com|publisher=tech crunch|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Hughes Network Systems LLC, one of the leading broadband solutions and providing services in the world, was granted a contract for an HX broadband satellite system and terminals by HISPASAT Colombia. This contract came as the result of the ''Vive Digital'' government initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=a0e98037-65de-45ec-a7c0-8757ca242454@sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=14E01172442C11C8&amp;db=edsnbk|title=United States : Hughes Technology Selected by HISPASAT to Bridge Digital Di...: Discovery|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes Network's increased presence within Colombia has exponentially increased the use of information and communication technologies in Colombia.

There are two main issues with the digital divide in Colombia that is being researched on. Those two are: how the information is being delivered and, how the information that is being delivered throughout the academic community is working and communicating. The solutions to these issues is getting everyone to focus on the main idea that the way they are communicating with the community is important and vital to civilization. It is important to send out accurate information, and not inform the community with false accusations. Research has shown that the delivery of information has become a vital aspect to Colombia and it includes the way everyone lives their daily lives. Researchers are focusing on the wide spectrum of how information is being spread, whether it is via internet, digital broadcast, mobile communication, or social media networks. With all of the research, it has also been noted to inform the community with the production of interpersonal communication and improvement in technological developments. The goal of the research is to improve the digital divide for Colombia's community to provide an adequate form of communication via the participating communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gronemeyer|first=M.E.|last2=Condeza|first2=Rayen|date=2013|title=Latin America: A Diversity of Approaches to Explore, Share and Discuss|url=|journal=International Journal Of Communication|volume=7|pages=1892–1895|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital divide in Ethiopia has caused a massive lack of information for many poorer individuals, however, the greatest failure relates to education. Between intense government regulation as well as economic factors, it is nearly impossible for the average person to access the internet. With such a gross lack of access to technology and the internet, education is stunted and children are forced to rely on archaic, biased, and often unreliable sources of information.&amp;nbsp;

The CIA notes that only 15% of the Ethiopian population is connected to the Internet placing the country at 107 of the 217 countries ranked in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2153rank.html#et|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
In 2016, the Ethiopian government blocked all social media sites after an anonymous user posted copies of university entrance exams online. In an interview with Reuters News Agency, Mohammed Seid at the Office for Government Communications Affairs, said only social media sites were blocked but BBC News received conflicting reports from Ethiopian citizens who claimed that they experienced problems with both mobile networks and fixed line Internet services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40118378|title=Ethiopia blocks internet during exams|date=2017-06-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly 40% of schools in Ethiopia have computers. Of that 40% most of the schools are located in Ethiopia'a capital, Addis Ababa. This in turn has created a divide between schools in urban cities like Addis Ababa and schools in rural areas. Most schools that are connected to the Internet have limited access and only use it for email that's solely for administrators. Many universities and higher learning institutions in Ethiopia have computers but the average ratio of students to computer is about 10:1. Only 15% of private universities in Ethiopia participate in Electronic Distance Education which is also known as online school. For many students, online education is a more convenient alternative to pursuing higher education because of their location.&lt;ref name="Ethiopian"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995541468256142802/pdf/463910BRI0Box31ia010ICTed0Survey111.pdf|title=ICT in Education in Ethiopia|last=Hare|first=Harry|date=June 2007|website=World Bank|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide gap. SchoolNet Ethiopia is a joint initiative between Ministry of Education and the United Nations Development Programme that has equipped 181 schools with 15 networked computer labs. The Distance Learning initiative backed by The Ministry of Education has been working with the Indira Gandhi National Open University in India to provide master's degrees to students from the University of Addis Adaba in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Ethiopian" /&gt;

=== Effects ===
In a world almost completely reliant on technology and access to the internet, the [[digital divide]] in [[Ethiopia]] poses a major problem for its citizens and the effects are nearly detrimental in the current global economy. Without access to the internet, Ethiopia cannot compete with the rest of the world and this has caused many gradual effects. These include lack of education, continued economic depression, and a gross lack of transparency in the Ethiopian government, as well as many other smaller, trickle down effects.&amp;nbsp;

One of the greatest effects the digital divide has one Ethiopia is the lack of education. Approximately 39% of adult Ethiopians can read and a mere 55% of school aged children actually attend school full-time. With an essentially&amp;nbsp;non-existent public education system in this poverty stricken country, the current lack of digital access does not help this matter. An improved access to the internet could help better educate Ethiopian children and with decreased costs as well.

Another effect of the gross disparity in digital access is the economic impact on [[Economy of Ethiopia|Ethiopia's economy]]. Ethiopia is currently one of 19 remaining countries on earth without a true stock exchange. Without access to capital and investments, Ethiopia’s economy is growing at a snail pace of 5.4% in 2017. The digital divide plays a major factor in this because without access to technology the economy cannot keep up with the rest of the world. &amp;nbsp;

The [[Government of Ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] has a very well established reputation of being suppressive and corrupt throughout the world, and the digital divide also impact this. The few citizens with access to the internet who participate in the media are often heavily censored. With access to the internet, freedom of speech would be more easily accessible and less censored. The Ethiopian government would benefit from this because with more fair media coverage there would be less government corruption thus making Ethiopia a more stable country to invest in.

=== Gender ===
Ethiopian women experience more barriers to overcoming this digital divide than men, resulting in a gender gap. Many of these barriers are socially constructed through discriminating gender roles. Women's time and mobility are restricted by the expectation placed on them to bear the most household chores and management, keeping them too busy for educational or leisurely use of technology. Technological devices such as radios or movie showings are gendered as masculine tools and toys that are unfit for women. The restriction on time and mobility placed on women to work at home also cuts down on female participation in education, making them less comfortable with the idea of using computers and mobile phones because they believe themselves to not be educated enough to understand the devices or software. The risks of exploitation or exposure to pornography or harassment online also discourage the use of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cipesa.org/2017/03/gender-digital-divide-persists-in-africa/|title=Gender Digital Divide Persists in Africa|website=cipesa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itidjournal.org/itid/article/viewFile/792/333|title=Earphones Are Not for Women: Gendered ICT Use Among Youths in Ethiopia and Malawi|last=Geldof|first=Marije|date=Winter 2011|website=|access-date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SOAWR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soawr.org/resources/women_and_ICTs.pdf|title=Bridging the Digital Gender Divide in Africa|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women could benefit from measures to increase their access to technology and close the digital divide between the genders. Access to technology and the internet would provide a wealth of information that is vital to entrepreneurship and practicing democracy. Policies and laws that discriminate against women and other social and political inequalities can be discussed and changed by allowing more effective means of communication and organization for those who fight for women's rights.&lt;ref name="SOAWR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scidev.net/global/digital-divide/feature/ethiopia-gets-connected.html|title=Ethiopia gets connected|last=SciDev.Net|work=SciDev.Net|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/gaef3432.doc.htm|title=Closing Digital Divide Critical to Social, Economic Development, Delegates Say at Second Committee Debate on Information and Communications Technologies {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Internet in France}}
The Digital Divide refers to the gap in exposure to technology needed to access the internet and online resources amongst a population. This gap leads to a decrease in the standard of living for those without access to technology while the standard of living for those who do have access to technology increases exponentially.&lt;ref name="PRCFrance"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poushter|first1=Jacob|title=Not everyone in advanced economies is using social media|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/20/not-everyone-in-advanced-economies-is-using-social-media/|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global digital divide has been an issue for hundreds of years and is far from a new phenomenon. Currently, in most countries, the digital divide is becoming notably less wide due to an increase in availability of affordable electronic devices capable of accessing the internet and has led to an extraordinary increase in competition amongst technological markets. An increase in competition has resulted in increased exposure to new technology with internet access in even the lowest income areas. Despite the increased exposure to technology, there are still other elements of technological access that contribute to the gap. These disparities continue to contribute to the gap that divides nations and prevents historically underprivileged groups from meeting the societal standards that will allow them to thrive in current society.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008/&gt;

The three digital divides in France are characterized as generational, social and cultural differences, according to a report released by the Center for Strategic Analysis in the French government. The generational gap generally affects the elderly since they are the most unfamiliar with newer technologies. The social divide affects the poor since they are less likely to have the budget for technological devices. The cultural divide affects the least educated of the French since they have fewer opportunities for properly utilizing technology.&lt;ref name="LeMonde"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2011/04/20/un-rapport-decrit-les-trois-fosses-numeriques-en-france_1510566_651865.html|title=A report describes the three "digital divides" in France|last=Checola|first=Laurent|date=2011-04-20|website=LeMonde|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey released by the centre de recherche pour l'étude et l'observation des conditions de vie reported that 17% of the people in France do not have a home computer, 19% do not have any access to the internet, and 23% have no internet access at home. They also reported that only 1 in 3 people aged 70 or older can be considered internet users.

=== Internet Accessibility ===
In France, internet accessibility is not equally distributed among the entire population.&lt;ref name="PRCFrance" /&gt; Factors that determine internet accessibility in the French community are age, education, and income. Higher internet availability was found among French residents younger than 30 years of age, completed some level of higher education, and are currently employed or in school.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renahy|first1=Emilie|title=Health information seeking on the Internet: a double divide? Results from a representative survey in the Paris metropolitan area, France, 2005–2006|journal=BMC Public Health|date=21 February 2008|volume=8|issue=69|pages=1–10|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-69|url=https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2458-8-69?site=bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age ====
A decrease in internet accessibility correlates with increasing age in France. Those younger than 30 have been recorded to have the highest access to internet. French students retain the highest accessibility. After 30 years of age, accessibility declines. French 59 years and older retain the lowest internet accessibility.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008/&gt;

Less than 17% of people over the age of 75 have a computer at their home. In comparison, more than 90% of people aged 15 to 24 have a home computer. This is quite a large divide with senior citizens who make up about 20% of the population.&lt;ref name="LeMonde" /&gt;

==== Education ====
Higher education correlates to increasing internet accessibility. There is a sharp division between primary and secondary education. [[Secondary education]] graduates have four times the accessibility to internet versus those with only [[primary education]]. [[Post-secondary education]] degrees continue to show an exponential increase in internet accessibility.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008/&gt;

==== Income ====
Households with higher income levels reflect an increased internet accessibility. Residents with higher salaries are more likely to be able to afford internet connection. The trend persists between employed and unemployed residents. The employed population is 40% more likely to have access to internet.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008/&gt;

Of the individuals with lowest incomes in France only 34% have a home computer and only 28% have internet connection.  In contrast, 91% of the individuals with considerable wealth have a home computer and 87% have internet connection.&lt;ref name="LeMonde" /&gt;

=== Language ===
A language system is normally included in [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]]. Certain languages are more prominent in ICT's than others. Data collected in 2007 states that 45% of information on the internet is in English while 4.41% is in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaman|first=Ismail|date=2015|title=Digital divide within the context of language and foreign language teaching|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877042815005753/1-s2.0-S1877042815005753-main.pdf?_tid=a8f35632-ce41-11e7-bc68-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1511216886_ea6862754fae0ebcf7cc703a377d02bf|journal=Procedia- Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=176|pages=766–771|via=Elsevier science direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate study published by UNESCO in 2009 compared the amount of Wikipedia articles available per language. 2,259,431 articles (23.078%) were available in English and 629,004 articles (6.425%) were available in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twelve years of measuring linguistic diversity in the Internet: balance and perspectives|last=Pimienta|first=Daniel|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|year=2009|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the total population in France, only 39% speak English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-01-06|title=Wayback Machine|date=2016-01-06|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solutions ===
France has made significant impact on closing the digital divide.&lt;ref&gt;Schement, Jorge R., and Brent D. Ruben. Between Communication and Information. Vol. 4, Transaction Publ., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancements and government funded programs have led to several innovative solutions and a narrowed gap between social classes within the nation regarding internet access and technological availability.&lt;ref name="Demunter, Christophe 2005"&gt;Demunter, Christophe. “The Digital Divide in Europe.” Statistics in Focus, 10 Dec. 2005, aei.pitt.edu/85501/1/2005.38.pdf?&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the French government began a program to curb the nation’s digital divide and starting offering a computer with high speed internet access to 1.2 million of its poorest citizens for just 1 euro a day. Mainly to ensure they would have access to the growing number of government services available online. Prime Minister Villepin announced the plan after a meeting of the interministerial committee for the Information Society. A similar project also launched in 2004 sought to put internet connected computers into the hands of university students, also for 1 euro a day, and between September 2004 and September 2005 the number of students with laptops rose from 8 to 22 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2657610/networking/france-picks-fight-with-digital-divide.html|title=France Picks a fight with the digital divide|last=Sayer|first=Peter|date=11 July 2006|website=www.Infoworld.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110064730/http://www.infoworld.com/article/2657610/networking/france-picks-fight-with-digital-divide.html|archive-date=2014-11-10|dead-url=no|access-date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Center for Strategic Analysis released several recommendations for bridging the digital divide in 2011. Since many digital divides exist they have decided to take political actions to close the gaps. They also want to use public information campaigns to educate people.&lt;ref name="AuvF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.strategie.gouv.fr/cas/en/content/digital-divide-france.html|title=The Digital Divide in France|last=Auverlot|first=Dominique|last2=Hamelin|first2=Joel|date=|website=archives.strategie.gouv.fr|access-date=23 October 2017|last3=LeJeune|first3=Eugenia|last4=Rent|first4=Jean-Loup|last5=River|first5=Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; For poor and uneducated households they will work to lower the costs associated with network access and also help with the cost of various types of devices for people to access those networks. There is an effort to try and better integrate older people into the digital society, by offering them assistance and education when it comes to participating in the digital society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.strategie.gouv.fr/cas/en/content/digital-divide-france-policy-brief-218.html|title=The Digital Divide in France Policy Brief 218|last=Auverlot|first=Dominique|last2=Hemelin|first2=Joel|date=18 April 2011|website=archives.strategie.gouv.fr|access-date=23 October 2017|last3=LeJeune|first3=Eugenia|last4=Rent|first4=Jean-Loup|last5=River|first5=Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will integrate the use of digital technologies in education to highlight good internet practices and to reduce the inequalities in schools. There is a push to showcase 'digital natives', which are those who were born into the digital world, adapting new social behaviors because of the way they integrate new interactive technology into their lives.&lt;ref name="AuvF" /&gt;

=== Minitel System ===
The Minitel System was one of France's earliest attempts to bridge the gap caused by the digital divide. The Minitel System, influenced greatly by the French government, was introduced in 1983 and "laid the groundwork for France's computerized future".&lt;ref name="Mailland, Julien 2017"&gt;Mailland, Julien, and Kevin Driscoll. “Minitel: The Online World France Built Before the Web.” IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News, 20 June 2017, spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/cyberspace/minitel-the-online-world-france-built-before-the-web.&lt;/ref&gt; The system provided French telephone users with access to online databases through their own personal phone line for no extra charge. The videotex service was accessed through a text-interface monitor and keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moulaison|first1=H.|date=2004|title=The Minitel and France's legacy of democratic information access|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X03000960?via%3Dihub|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=21|issue=1|pages=99–107|doi=|accessdate=24 October 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the system provided access only to things like phone books; however, in little time, users would be able to access numerous online services that allowed them to do things like view and pay bills and online shop. France Telecom made the service more user friendly, bundling users’ online purchases and telephone bills together. The Mintier System continued to grow and was able to provide access to "more than 20,000 online services before the World Wide Web even got off the ground".&lt;ref name="Mailland, Julien 2017"/&gt; By the end of the 1980s, "every adult living in France had access to the network". The system proved to be very successful and continued to provide online content to French phone users until its demise in 2012.&lt;ref name="Mailland, Julien 2017"/&gt;

=== Libraries ===
One in four European internet users access the internet only outside of their home; this means that 1/4 of the current European internet users would not have access to the internet at all if it weren't for places with free public access to the internet such as government funded programs like libraries.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Merklin, Denis. “Is the Library a Political Institution? French Libraries Today and the Social Conflict between Démocratie and République.” LibraryTrends, vol. 65, no. 2, 2016. Academic Search Complete.&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries of France are considered to be largely influenced by their political intentions to level the success and education levels amongst the social classes.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; These libraries are strategically placed in low income areas and on the outskirts of big cities where incomes tend to be lower and crime and unemployment rates tend to be higher.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Unlike the uNited States and comparable nations, French libraries have extended hours and are open on all days of the week.&lt;ref name="Demunter, Christophe 2005"/&gt; Librarians working in these facilities generally have an aspiration to help those of struggling communities enhance their education and learn to use new technology. These facilities have proven to be helpful in bridging the gap between high and low income social classes by exposing French citizens of low income areas to new technology, providing them with access to the internet, and thus lowering unemployment rates.&lt;ref&gt;

Germany's digital divide is impacted by several factors that include age, gender, family structure, education, ethnicity, and motivation. There are still areas in Germany that lack access to high-speed internet and large cities tend to have more access to the internet than rural communities. In 2006, the (N)Onliner Atlas recorded that only 51% of small rural communities (pop. &lt; 5,000) were Internet users, eleven points less than their urban counterparts in large cities (pop. &gt; 500,000), where Internet usage rates averaged 62%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schleife|first=Katrin|date=February 2007|title=Regional Versus Individual Aspects of the Digital Divide in Germany|url=http://www.zew.de/en/publikationen/regional-versus-individual-aspects-of-the-digital-divide-in-germany/|journal=ZEW Discussion Papers|volume=|pages=|via=Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital divide in [[Japan]] is the disparity of access to the Internet by the population of Japan. Multiple factors influence this divide. Cultural aspects of Japanese people contribute to the digital divide in the nation. Contributing cultural factors to the digital divide present in Japan are closing over time. Groups shown to be improving access include women and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=Japan Profile (Latest data available: 2016)|url=https://www.itu.int/net4/itu-d/icteye/CountryProfileReport.aspx?countryID=120|journal=International Telecommunication Union|volume=|pages=|via=International Telecommunication Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; 97.1% of the households in Japan have Internet access at home while 81% of the households in Japan have personal computers.

The 2015 population census of Japan was released,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/info/news/20161227.htm|title=Statistics Bureau Home Page/News Bulletin December 27, 2016|website=www.stat.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; under 15 years of age are about 16 mil  which is 12.6% of the total population. 76 mil of the population is the age 15–64 years of age which is 60.7% of the total population and 3.3mil are 65 years and higher are 26.6%.

===Cultural cause ===
According to the Japanese Statistics Bureau, MPHPA, and World Internet Project Japan, in 2001, 44% of the population was online, and 41% of that group were females. Additionally, figures point to declining disparity among internet access in various socioeconomic classes and gender. Additionally, figures show that younger Japanese individuals use the internet as compared to older Japanese individuals. All gaps are shown to be narrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Wenhong|date=Summer 2004|title=The Global Digital Divide –Within and Between Countries|url=|journal=IT&amp;Society|volume=1|pages=18–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study produced at the University of Buffalo shows that the Japanese consider advanced ICTs a common commodity, not as necessary for advancement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ubir.buffalo.edu/xmlui/handle/10477/46082]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine Information Literacy website, which had an article based on a forum hosted by ASEAN and Japan about media and information literacy, held a two-day event that discussed “how the youth should cope with the rapidly growing world online—particularly the rise of social media—and how they could protect themselves from its hazards.” It also informed the audience about the advantages of technology and how telecommunications has taken over. 

===Population ===
Japan is divided into territorial divisions and depending on which geographic area that you live in, and everyone either has internet or no one has internet.

According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, there are a total of 39 “Zero Broadband Areas” in Japan. This is where there is no broadband access for even a single household within the district. This means Japanese citizens cannot get broadband even if they wanted to because there is no broadband infrastructure in their neighborhood. For some territorial divisions the coverage is up to 99.8% of the people in this area have access to broadband. This leads to a digital divide, but the divide is more drastic at the ends of the curve depending on where you{{Who|date=January 2018}} live.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is aiming to improve broadband penetration in remote areas of Japan, but businesses aren’t exactly queuing up to provide expensive infrastructure to hook up remote islands and mountain villages. Japan has more than 4000 islands, 260 of which are inhabited. Japan’s land is also 73% mountainous or hilly, and whilst the population is concentrated mainly in the alluvial plains and coastal areas, there are significant populations living in remote valleys deep in the mountains mainly engaged in agriculture or forestry. It is difficult to justify building out a fiber-based infrastructure to a remote island, or to a dead end mountain ravine community miles from anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fukumimi.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/the-digital-divide-in-japan/|title=The Digital Divide in Japan|date=28 June 2006|website=Wordpress.com|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible solutions ===
The internet users in Japan are increasing at an exponential rate but there are still areas demographically do not receive optimal broadband satellite [[communications in Japan]]. A possible solution for this is to launch more satellites for those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=Connection The Unconnected Working together to achieve connect 2020 Agenda Targets|url=http://broadbandcommission.org/Documents/ITU_discussion-paper_Davos2017.pdf|journal=International Telecommunication Union (ITU)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally separated into categories of 58% female(most pronounced in [[Africa]], [[Arab states]] and [[Asia-Pacific]]), 60% rural,poor, illiterate and elderly are offline.

Rural areas need to implement a low-cost, given the lower household income is lower in these areas, another idea for rural areas is to provide public buildings with internet access.

In Mexico, half of the population does not have access to the internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-07-01|title=THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN MEXICO: A MIRROR OF POVERTY|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1870057816300464|journal=Mexican Law Review|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=93–102|doi=10.1016/j.mexlaw.2016.09.005|issn=1870-0578}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 50.4 % of Mexican households had access to the internet and 45.4 % had a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.www.inegi.org.mx/temas/ticshogares/|title=TIC's en hogares|last=(INEGI)|first=Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía|website=en.www.inegi.org.mx|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide in Mexico is related to low income, education, lack of proper infrastructure, and geographical location.

=== Reasons for the Divide ===
Wealthier Mexicans are more likely than poorer Mexicans to have access to the internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of certain dominant players monopolizing the [[telecommunication]] sector in Mexico, the majority of the Mexican population cannot afford the expensive services of television and internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Formal learning|Formal schooling]] is scarce in the poor regions of Mexico leaving many school-aged children without internet access.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curry|first=James|last2=Kenney|first2=Martin|date=2006-03-06|title=Digital divide or digital development?: The Internet in Mexico|url=https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1318|journal=First Monday|language=en-US|volume=11|issue=3|doi=10.5210/fm.v11i3.1318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have only received an elementary education are four times less likely to access or use the internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Mexico, 33% of primary and 48% of secondary schools have access to the internet and report having one computer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://webfoundation.org/2018/05/the-hidden-gender-gap-internet-access-statistics-in-mexico/|title=The hidden gender gap: Internet access statistics in Mexico|work=World Wide Web Foundation|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has addressed the issue by providing technologies that provide the capability to access the internet, but teachers and students are not instructed on how to use them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Mexico's lack of proper [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber optic]] infrastructure causes less wireless [[broadband]] penetration in the country, which in turn effects the number of internet users in Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Fiber-optic communication|Fiber optic]] infrastructure is found more in urban than rural areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Urban internet usage is significantly higher than rural internet usage. In big cities such as Mexico City, citizens doubled the national average in terms of computer ownership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2000, the southern border states of Mexico had half as many phones per capita as the northern states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Morocco ==
{{See also|Internet in Morocco}}

The digital divide is an issue for countries like [[Morocco]] who are trying to provide improved internet availability to its people. While internet is available to a majority of people in city centers, rural locations are still without access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oafrica.com/ict-policy/the-use-of-the-internet-in-morocco-measuring-the-new-digital-divide/|title=The use of the Internet in Morocco: measuring the second level digital divide|work=oAfrica|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists some restrictions on [[telecommunication]] services and limited service providers to choose from. This acts as a block for Moroccan internet users because the lack of competition can become costly. The cost associated with internet services also prevents those who are more economically disadvantaged from accessing the same types of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/morocco|title=Morocco|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations to Internet Access ===
Some of the main limitations for access are education, gender, and age. People with lower education are less likely to access technology or further their professionalism in the [[information technology]] field. Moroccan women can often find that they do not have the same sort of opportunities to technology professions and internet usage. The [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) was formed to increase opportunities for women and a project called "Achieving E-Quality in the IT Sector in Morocco" has been set up for women to be presented with, increasing their professionalism. Ten universities currently participate in this project in an active effort to close the gender gap within the digital divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Bridging the Gender Digital Divide|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/es_mx/assets/docs/netacadmktglibrary/globalgender.pdf|journal=Cisco Systems|volume=|pages=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a discernible age gap between individuals who are active on [[social media]] and the internet and those who are not. Those aged 14–25 tend to be more familiar with the different social trends and access them much faster than the older generations. A large attribution to this is the lack of literacy in many adults. In 2010, 56%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.good.is/articles/morocco-women-girls-parents-literacy|title=Solving the Literacy Gender Gap in Morocco|last=|first=|date=|website=good.is|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Morocco's population was illiterate. While children able to go to school are learning to read, write and use various forms of technology; many of their parents do not have access to these same resources and may not have had access while they were growing up. The largest city of Morocco, [[Casablanca]], has a population of 3,544,498 as of 2016. Around 57.6% of the people throughout Morocco had access to the internet in 2016 while the rural population was 39.32%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS?locations=MA|title=Rural Population (% of total population)|last=|first=|date=|website=The World Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a little over half of the population having access to internet many adults that lack literacy skills are currently living in rural areas with minimal access and usage of the internet, yet for their children they have the opportunity to occasionally access the internet through schooling.

=== Solutions ===
The government of Morocco has become increasingly involved in closing the digital divide being experienced by the country. Morocco lags behind in the digital world and steps are actively being taken to fix this. One plan that has been put in place is called “Maroc Numeric 2013”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lematin.ma/journal/2012/NTI_Strategie-de-Maroc-Numeric-2013--un-premier-bilan-globalement-positif/170317.html|title=Le Matin - «Stratégie de Maroc Numeric 2013 : un premier bilan globalement positif»|last=MATIN|first=, LE|work=Le Matin|access-date=2017-10-12|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was initiated in 2013 in an attempt to get Morocco more involved in the digital world as well as provide some protections for internet users. This plan has the potential to boost the nation's [[Economy of Morocco|economy]] by creating jobs. The plans passed in government legislation also work to reduce some of the costs associated with internet connection and usage by ensuring that internet services can operate on a [[free market]] with little to no control unlike the newspapers and television stations of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egov.ma/en/ict-infrastructure|title=ICT infrastructure|last=|first=|date=|website=gov.ma e-Government Program Kingdom of Morocco|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts by the Moroccan government there is still some gap in digital connection among its people. The wealthier population still has higher internet access than those that are poorer. There has been some improvement with the help of free market [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to make access to the internet more readily available to all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.psu.edu/northafricacomm410/2013/12/16/blogging-in-morocco/|title=Digital Divide In Morocco {{!}} North Africa - COMM410 Regional Focus|website=sites.psu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Samuel Lee, Fabian Seiderer and Lida Bteddini, one potential solution could be increasing and improving the lines of communication between the Moroccan government and it’s people who have expressed much interest in being involved with legal [[legislation]] and having more access to [[knowledge]] online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/07/25/digital-citizen-engagement-morocco/|title=The untapped potential of digital citizen engagement in Morocco: a data-driven approach to online participation.|date=2014-07-25|work=Impact of Social Sciences|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final solution might be updating the original plan, “Digital Morocco 2013” that was put in place in an attempt to bridge the digital divide. While the plan has led to some improvement, connectivity and usage of the internet is still limited to the more educated and [[Urban area|urban]] regions of the Moroccan kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2012/10/60931/morocco-digital-divide-persists/|title=Morocco digital divide persists|date=2012-10-14|work=Morocco World News|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myanmar ==
{{see also|Internet in Myanmar}}

The digital divide in Myanmar is impacted by gender and economic class. Wealthy and powerful persons tend to have better access than those who are poor and men typically have more opportunities to get involved in the tele-infrastructure business. The tele-infrastructure in Myanmar is relatively weak compared to those in surrounding countries. The internet supply doesn't meet the increasing demand; hence the digital divide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Economic issues===
[[Myanmar]] is a country with low income level and most internet access is on cellphones, because of the low simcard cost. The people who live above the poverty line have all kinds of modern-day access unlike the average or poor who struggle in the everyday necessities.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invest in Myanmar|url=http://www.investinmyanmar.com/myanmar-tax-rates/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 it was recorded that 0.94 percent of Myanmar's population had cell phone subscriptions, due to low trade and economic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cellphone Subscriptions|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=wb-wdi&amp;met=it_net_user&amp;idim=country:MMR&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=burma+internet+penetration#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=it_cel_sets_p2&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:MMR:USA&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/new-private-companies-spark-mobile-phone-revolution-in-once-isolated-burma/2014/11/21/eb4479c2-6c41-11e4-bafd-6598192a448d_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people who live above the poverty line have all kinds of modern-day access unlike the average or poor who struggle in the everyday necessities.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In 2016 Myanmar's [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) averaged $1,275.02 US dollars, which contrasts with that of the United States at an average of $57,466.79 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar GDP|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=MM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US GDP|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Myanmar internet demographics ===
The amount of internet users in Myanmar has increased significantly in the last few years. In 2014, there were 2 million internet users in Myanmar. That number, however, increased to 39 million users by 2016. The cause of this drastic increase in internet users was caused mainly by the massive increase in [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] sales recorded through May 2016. This combined with a more aggressive network roll-out by mobile providers to other regions, a decline in SIM card prices, the lowered prices of voice and data plans, and the lowered cost of mobile phones all led to this major increase in mobile sales and subscriptions over that two-year period. Because this market is beginning to reach its maturity stage, significant slowdown is predicted to occur by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500253015/Myanmar-internet-gets-boost-with-content-delivery-network|title=Myanmar internet gets boost with content delivery network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.budde.com.au/Research/Myanmar-Burma-Telecoms-Mobile-Broadband-and-Digital-Media-Statistics-and-Analyses|title=Myanmar (Burma) - Telecoms, Mobile, Broadband and Digital Media - Statistics and Analyses - BuddeComm|website=www.budde.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender digital divide ===
Nearly 30% of women are less likely to have access to a mobile device in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irex|first1=Irex|title=Ending the Gender Digital Divide in Myanmar|url=https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/node/resource/overview-gender-digital-divide-myanmar-assessment.pdf|website=Irex.org|publisher=IREX|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell phone is the main source of internet access in the country. Because of this deficit in internet access between the genders there is a Gender Digital Divide in Myanmar. There is also a significant wage gap between men and woman in addition to limited leadership positions available to be filled. Due to this woman are not as equally represented and often listed as a dependent. This gap contributes to the lack of resources, furthering the lack of digital activity for women. Currently Myanmar is working to close the gap by using more ICT’s in daily life in order to educate women.&amp;nbsp;However, due to the economic difference between to genders, women are less likely to have access to [[Information and communications technology|ICT’s]]. "IREX’s Tech Age Girls (TAG) program is addressing this gap in opportunity, providing more than 100 young women in Myanmar with the technology and leadership skills they need to achieve their goals and become agents of change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Mary Grace|title=How are tech-savvy girls in Myanmar closing the gender digital divide?|url=http://beyondaccess.net/2017/01/17/myanmar-gender-digital-divide/|website=Beyond Access|publisher=Beyond Access|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rural areas vs. Cities   ====
The Nepal government usually focuses their resources on important necessities such as clean water, roads, and healthcare, as the country is still poor and developing and most of their population lives in rural parts of Nepal.

Pakistan is one of the South Asian countries that does have internet access. Internet access in Pakistan began in the 1990s and has continued to grow over the past decades. In fact, Pakistan has about 32 million internet users. However, according to data collected by the World Bank, Pakistan has an overall population of about 193 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=PK|title=Population, total - Data|website=data.WorldBank.org|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Pakistan also has about 15 million people who access the internet from their mobile devices. Pakistan has 5 broadband internet providers and 10 DSL. Broadband use through computers is the number one way that people access the internet in Pakistan. The second most popular way that people of Pakistan access the internet is through their cellular devices. Even though there are about 32 million internet user compared to a large population, [[Internet in Pakistan#cite note-1|Internet in Pakistan]] is ranked 20th in the world.

===Cell phone coverage===
Pakistan has five major cell phone providers. The five are (in order from most to fewest subscribers): [[Jazz (mobile network)|Jazz]] 51.88 million; Telenor 39.37 million; Zong 27.71 million; Ufone 18.46 million; and Warid 12 million.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Recently in May 2017, the Pakistani government decided to lower tariffs and taxes on cellular services as well as on mobile phones. The reasons for this decision included years of pressure from the nation's top mobile operators and a [[World Bank]] report pointing out [[Pakistan]]'s high taxing of telecom services in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/pakistan-to-cut-taxes-on-mobile-services-handsets/|title=Pakistan to cut taxes on mobile services, handsets - Mobile World Live|date=2017-05-29|work=Mobile World Live|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and caste===
In rural Pakistan, cell service use is divided along gender lines. Karin Astrid Siegmann pointed out this disparity; 40 percent of female users have to ask permission from the male owners to make calls. Cell phones being in the hands of females is viewed unfavorably in Pakistani culture. According to one participant in the study, from the [[Muzaffargarh|Muzzafargarh]] district in rural Pakistan, "Women don't even know how to dial a number."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan038260.pdf|title=The Gender Digital Divide in Rural Pakistan: How wide is it &amp; how to bridge it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the percentage of women owning a cell phone is 36% compared to men at 78% overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallup.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Weekend-Read-42-Mobile-Phone-Usage-and-Access-in-Pakistan-by-Abdullah-Waqar-Tajwar2.pdf|title=Gallup Pakistan History Project's Weekend Read 42: Mobile Phone Usage and Access in Pakistan: An Analysis of Trends in 2015 and 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides gender, there is a distinct divide among [[caste]]s. Newer castes rank much more highly on the [[Digital Access Index]] (DAI) than do the older castes. The same study compared two political parties. One political party, called the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|PTI]] ([[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]]), was composed of newer castes [[Khan (caste)|(Khan]], [[Hashmi]], [[Alvi]], and [[Qureshi]]). The [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] is composed of older castes. The PTI outperformed the Pakistan Muslim League in number of foreign visitors to its web site, with a combined percentage of 12.7%, and in websites linking to it with 450, compared to the Muslim League's 168 (See Table 6 page 354). Ahsan Abdullah elaborates the important background of these findings: "Members of the new caste traditionally have not been farmers; for example, members of the [[Sheikh caste|Sheikh]] caste are traditionally traders, and members of the [[Syed]] caste traditionally hold religious offices, and hence they have to be better educated as compared to the old caste members. The old caste members, who are traditionally farmers, require tacit knowledge more than education to be successful. This observation is supported by the higher literacy rate in new castes as compared to the old caste members, with [[Pathan]], Sheikh, and Syed being the top three educated castes among the 12 castes considered."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=15&amp;sid=a768fe68-af9d-44eb-af35-d77ac5d19ee3%40sessionmgr103|title=Digital Divide and Caste in Rural Pakistan|last=Abdullah|first=Ahsan|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000000/http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid%3D15%26sid%3Da768fe68%2Daf9d%2D44eb%2Daf35%2Dd77ac5d19ee3%40sessionmgr103|archive-date=2016-12-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solutions===
Besides Private efforts, Public efforts put forth by the Pakistani government would help bridge the digital divide. There is an ambitious undertaking called the Universal Services Fund which would aim to provide broadband coverage to the whole nation by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/a4t_e/s2_shah.pdf|title=National Perspectives on bridging the Digital Divide –&amp;nbsp;Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the WTO|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philippines ==
{{see also|Internet in the Philippines}}
In the Philippines about 47 to 50% of the population can and has access to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogwatch.tv/2017/03/what-is-the-digital-divide/|title=What is the digital divide?|date=2017-03-22|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the Philippines only had BBS ([[Bulletin board system]]) access, however after March 29, 1994 the Philippine Network Foundation (PHNet) connected the country to the web via Sprint. As of 2010, 29.3 million Filipinos were using the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoeffel|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Rastogi|first2=Sonya|last3=Ouk Kim|first3=Myoung|last4=Shahid|first4=Hasan|title=The Asian Population: 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-11.pdf|website=Census Bureau|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Jon|title=Philippines named Social Networking Capital of the World|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2011/05/philippines-named-the-social-networking-capital-of-the-world-indonesia-malaysia-amongst-top-10/#pWievTJiqvEuvsd2.97|website=Asian Corresponded|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide is impacted by several factors that includes income and education. Jim-yong Kim, president of the World Bank Group, has stated that “We must continue to connect everyone and leave no one behind because the cost of lost opportunities is enormous. But for digital dividends to be widely shared among all parts of society, countries also need to improve their business climate, invest in people’s education and health, and promote good governance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/millions-of-filipinos-suffer-the-social-injustice-of-digital-divide-world-bank-report/|title=Millions of Filipinos suffer the social injustice of digital divide: World Bank report {{!}} BusinessMirror|website=businessmirror.com.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on politics and culture===
Based on Philippines government research, there is a noticeable rise of Internet use in the Philippines after it was first introduced on March 29, 1994.  “They were connected to the internet via [[SprintLink]]”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Internet in the Philippines|url=http://www.dict.gov.ph/the-history-of-internet-in-the-philippines/|website=GOVPH|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; this changed the Philippines culturally and politically. Social media is a leading motive for Internet use in the Philippines, but Internet use also plays a big part in their political communications.  The [[Philippine presidential election, 1998|Philippine presidential election of Estrada]] is where Internet use for politics started to take form.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karan|first1=Kavita|last2=Gimeno|first2=Jacques|last3=Tandoc|first3=Edson|title=Internet and Social Networking Sites in Election Campaigns: Gabriela Women’s Party in Philippines wins the 2007 Elections|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edson_Tandoc/publication/237373309_Internet_and_Social_Networking_Sites_in_Election_Campaigns_Gabriela_Women%27s_Party_in_Philippines_wins_the_2007_Elections/links/0deec53097c4145d06000000/Internet-and-Social-Networking-Sites-in-Election-Campaigns-Gabriela-Womens-Party-in-Philippines-wins-the-2007-Elections.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the protests, Filipinos used Internet to display charges against Estrada.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

=== Education ===
The Philippines was the only country in the Southeast Asia region that had a declining youth literacy rate between the years of 1990 and 2004, according to data from the United Nations. This prompted major school reforms and in 2012, a K-12 school curriculum was introduced which included a year of kindergarten and two senior school years. The Department of Education in the Philippines (DepEd) goal for students who graduate from the K-12 curriculum is for these students to understand technology works and how they can benefit from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Nick|title=Education in the Philippines|url=https://wenr.wes.org/2015/06/education-philippines|website=World Education News &amp; Reviews|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curriculum of this program focuses on developing students to be comfortable with using computers and technology. Some examples are that in grade 4 students will learn how to use the basic functions of the computer, including the use of the internet and emailing, in safe ways. In grade 6, students will begin taking art classes to learn how to use technology for digital paintings and graphic designs. In grade 7, students will begin learning how to academically use the internet for journals and searching for academic sources for essays and other similar assignments. In the higher upper level grades, the curriculum will include schools that specialize in computer education as well as science and technology. The Philippines being able to close in on the technology gap after being so behind in the 90's and early 2000's is going to very much improve the graduation rate of the students now that they can study at home and use their sources to their advantage through tablets and computers instead of only being able to access their school work in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cruz|first1=Isagani|title=Technology in K to 12|url=http://www.philstar.com/education-and-home/2015/07/30/1482483/technology-k-12|website=philstar Global|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Saudi Arabia ==
The digital divide in Saudi Arabia is seen through their Internet usage statistics 47.5% of Saudi Arabians use the internet compared to 78.2% of the United States. Of the 47.5%, 83.87% of Saudi households use the internet and only 10% of these households have one internet user&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stats.gov.sa/sites/default/files/en-demographic-research-2016_2.pdf|title=Saudi Arabia Demographic Survey 2016|last=|first=|date=2016|website=General Authority for Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Saudi Arabia, as of 2017, has 96% of women using the internet and 88% of men. In addition, both females and males use the internet almost equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/SAUDIA_%20ARABIA.pdf|title=Responses to Questions related to "Report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on ways to bridge the Gender Divide from a human right perspective|last=Palais|first=Wilson|date=10 January 2017|website=The Permanent Mission of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South Africa ==
{{Main|Digital divide in South Africa}}
South Africa's Digital Divide is being bridged by programs like Isifundo. This program provides computer literacy for South Africans who would otherwise not receive any training. They set up centers that provide access to computers and the internet. Their Facebook keeps people up to date with computer related news and other helpful programs in South Africa.

== South Korea ==
{{see also|Internet in South Korea}}
The digital divide in South Korea is mainly caused by the unevenness of economic, regional, physical, or social opportunities, leading to marginalized persons not receiving the benefits that technology can bring. The lack of adaptation to the [[informatization]] of social services, such as administration and welfare, results in limited opportunities for basic daily life and social participation. South Korea's information gap was initially due to economic reasons and the difference in the initial cost for using the Internet or PC, but recently there has been a gap between the users of the information according to the degree of utilization of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=정보격차(Digital Divide)|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=101013000769848|website=DooSan Dictionary|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the information society rapidly developed, the distribution of the Internet quickly accelerated in Korea, dividing people into two groups, people who are well adapted to the changes and those who are more familiar with the previous media. Although the percentage of local population with internet access is high in Korea, the average rate of internet usage is 99.9% for the young and 64.3% for the elderly.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Drawbacks of digital divide in Korea ===
[[File:GlobalBandwidthConcentration.jpg|thumb|450px |South Korea has become a more influential country with bandwidth.]]

As transiting society from industrial to de-industrial, information and knowledge can be substituted with capital and product in important social matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=탈공업사회(De-industrial society)|url=https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%83%88%EA%B3%B5%EC%97%85_%EC%82%AC%ED%9A%8C|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

However, the nature of information and knowledge, through [[commercialization]] process in [[capitalism]], could make a greater problem than supposition. So, information and knowledge is different from previous product( shoes, clothes, food so on) in that information and knowledge’s cyclic process from creating and application to extinction is most fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=탈산업화 네이버 지식백과(De-industrialization on Naver 지식백과)|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1521470&amp;cid=42121&amp;categoryId=42121|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, those alteration in quantity and quality is unpredictable. From the nature of information and knowledge, those could make enormous social inequality(ex. class, state, sex, education, region etc.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=고|first1=영복|title=사회학사전(Sociology Dictionary)|url=http://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=36268|website=Naver Book|publisher=사회문화연구소|accessdate=30 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a global effect feature, one of the information and knowledge’s nature, can deepen global inequality and further sharpen the 2080 society, called [[Pareto principle|Pareto's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pareto's law on HanKyung Dictionary|url=http://dic.hankyung.com/apps/economy.view?seq=4941|accessdate=15 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasons and correlating variables ===

==== Distribution of hardware ====
The most basic reason is the distribution of hardware. The most basic hardware in the information era is a computer, which creates an information gap between those who have difficulties buying a computer and those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital inequalities and why they matter on Taylor &amp; Francis Online|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1012532?journalCode=rics20|access-date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the '2016 Information Gap Index and Survey' in South Korea, which conducted by the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) on 6,300 people nationwide, while only 53.2% of the underprivileged people have personal computer, the average proportion of whole people are nearly 83%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nia.or.kr/viewer/skin/doc.html?fn=a65cf074_3036_42ee_b74e_b10fd82dc456.pdf&amp;rs=/viewer/result//board/81623/|title=2016 Information Gap Index and Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nia.or.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer penetration rates are affected by many correlating variables such as region, education, and income and these variables can issue a complex impact. To overcome this difference, OLPC (One Laptop per child) is developing and also distributing $100 computer. In addition, a project for the free use of the internet such as the fund router project is in progress, but it is not widely available in Korea. As 'ubiquitous' becomes more and more popular, the distribution of small hardware is expected to grow even more and the digital divide is expected to deepen further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=HanWoo|date=Summer 2007|title=The Digital Divide in South Korea|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan046433.pdf|journal=|volume=1|pages=8|via=journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education ====
Education is the most relevant part of income in Korea.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|last1=SeHwan|first1=Bak|title=South Korea to offer more education support for low-income groups|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170731000890|website=the Korea Herald|publisher=the Korea Herald|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children whose lower income earners have less educational opportunities than higher incom earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=C.Taylor|first1=Tess|title=The relationship between education and income on "lovetoknow"|url=http://jobs.lovetoknow.com/career-fields/relationship-between-education-income|website=lovetoknow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the children of low educated are more likely to be a low educated students than those of highly educated people, and this phenomenon leads to a vicious cycle of [[social inequality]].&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Because the information era is built on [[capitalism]], this vicious circle is likely to lead to current society as well. Education is an important reason of digital divide.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tustin|first1=Rachel|title=Bridging the Digital Divide in Education|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/bridging-the-digital-divide-in-education.html|website=study.com|publisher=study.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without education on information society, it leads to poverty of information which causes to the economic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexbeard|title=Addressing inequality in the digital era|url=http://www.alexbeard.org/wp/addressing-inequality-in-the-digital-era/|website=alexbeard.org|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of all, considering the characteristics of knowledge which is explosively expanding, if education can not keep up with the pace of the informational change, it can cause education gap to be more severe.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; In order to solve this problem, continuous education is much more required rather than shot term education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=carty|first1=winthrop|title=Public Education's Information Gap|url=https://nacla.org/article/public-educations-information-gap|website=nacla.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Internet in Thailand}}

Thailand's digital divide is impacted by its status as a [[developing country]] within [[Southeast Asia]] as well as several other factors that include income, choice of technologies, and socioeconomic factors.&lt;ref name="srinuan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinuan|first=Chalita|last2=Erik|first2=Bohlin|date=2011|title=What makes people go on line?

== United States ==
{{Main|Digital divide in the United States}}

The digital divide in the United States has decreased since it was initially detected, however there are still portions of the country and certain groups that have limited or no access. Groups impacted by the digital divide can include certain income brackets, ethnicities, and the less educated. There is also a gap between rural and non-rural areas in America. Rural Americans have made large gains in adopting digital technology in recent years, but they remain less likely than nonrural adults to have home broadband, smartphones and other devices. This is not necessarily because of a financial issue, but because of the lack of access and the poor internet connection due to the lack of towers and phone lines. Mobile technology use among rural adults has risen rapidly, however they are still leaps and bounds behind Americans in larger cities that have more access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/06/26/america-internet-use-digital-divide-pew-research-center/29337085/|title=Digital divide decreasing but not gone|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, approximately 11.5% of the total U.S. population did not have internet access. Out of the 324,118,787 Americans, there were 286,942,362 total internet users (88.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/us/|title=U.S. Internet Users|website=www.internetlivestats.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vietnam ==
{{see also|Internet in Vietnam}}

The digital divide in [[Internet censorship in Vietnam|Vietnam]] stems from sociopolitical, economic, and technological issues, but over the last decade{{When|date=January 2018}} the country has made great strides in providing large-scale Internet access and more lax restrictions in order to bridge this gap. Though the majority of Vietnam is rural, more than half of the country's population has access to the Internet. Despite these limitations on technology, organizations around the world are working directly with the people of Vietnam to close the digital divide.

=== Internet demographics === 
Vietnam has a population of 96 million people, and 34.9%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vm.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population is urban. Despite this, 53%&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tuoitrenews.vn/society/39704/up-to-90-of-vietnamese-to-have-internet-access-it-official|title=Up to 90% of Vietnamese to have Internet access: IT official - Tuoi Tre News|last=|first=|date=23 February 2017|work=Tuoi Tre News|access-date=2017-10-17|language=vi-VN}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the country’s population currently has access to the Internet. According to a study conducted by market research company Statista&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/|title=• Statista - The Statistics Portal for Market Data, Market Research and Market Studies|website=www.Statista.com|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, more than 91 percent of daily Internet users were between the ages of 25 and 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/348252/daily-internet-usage-age-group-vietnam/|title=Daily internet usage in Vietnam by age group 2016 {{!}} Statistic|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the expansion in access, Internet quality remains poor in rural areas, and Vietnam ranks 16th&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; among other Asian countries with the most Internet users. Vietnam also has a slower average data transfer speed than neighbor countries. Compared to [[Singapore]]’s average of 16.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, Vietnam’s average is 5.0&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/global-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-reports.jsp|title=Global State of the Internet Connectivity Reports {{!}} Akamai|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government censorship=== 
For individuals with access to the Internet, government censorship becomes another obstacle because the three Internet service providers in Vietnam (FPT Telecom,&lt;ref&gt;[https://fpt.com.vn/en/ Telecom]&lt;/ref&gt; Viet Nam Post and Telecommunications Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnpt.vn/Default.aspx?tabid=188 Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; and Viettel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vietteltelecom.vn/|title=Viettel|website=ViettelTelecom.vn|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are owned by the government and military.&lt;ref name="FreedomHouse"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/vietnam#sdfootnote5sym|title=Vietnam|last=|first=|date=|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese government restricts user access to websites that are critical of the government or feature politically sensitive content, as well as the websites of select human rights organizations.&lt;ref name="FreedomHouse" /&gt; In 2016, [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] were temporarily blocked in an effort by the government to crack down on social media due to rising unrest in [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref name="mashV" /&gt; Hundreds of citizens protested in city streets regarding the government’s delayed response to an environmental disaster in which millions of dead fish washed ashore. It was believed by locals to be the fault of [[Formosa Plastics Corp|Formosa Plastics]].&lt;ref name="mashV"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2016/05/18/vietnam-blocks-facebook/#qTUYe.DUB5qw|title=Vietnam 'blocks' Facebook over the weekend due to protests over dead fish|last=Ho|first=Victoria|date=|work=Mashable|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increasing information and communication technology ===
In 2011, [[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] extended a project for an additional two years in an attempt to complete the process of installing software and conducting training. This [[technology]] and training would potentially allow for the expansion of small businesses, enhance current operating systems and disseminate information on a larger scale. Due to the slow Internet speeds in Vietnam, obtaining information was difficult. However, this attempt at closing the digital divide was unsuccessful and expensive, totaling 106.97 million US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.worldbank.org/P079344/vietnam-ict-development?lang=en&amp;tab=overview|title=Projects  : Vietnam - ICT Development&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;The World Bank|website=projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this project was unsuccessful, organizations{{Who|date=January 2018}} are still working to solve the issue of the digital divide.

'''Distributed Processing Technology''' (DPT) was founded in 1977, in [[Maitland, Florida]]. DPT was an early pioneer in [[computer data storage|computer storage]] technology, popularizing the use of disk caching in the 1980s and 1990s. DPT was the first company to design, manufacture and sell microprocessor-based intelligent [[cache (computing)|caching]] [[disk controller]]s to the [[OEM]] computer market. Prior to DPT, disk caching technology had been implemented in proprietary hardware in mainframe computing to improve the [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics|speed of disk access]].&lt;ref name=obj6:3&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maitland manufacturer's electronic part becomes darling of computer trade|journal=Orlando Business Journal|date=July 2–8, 1989|volume=6:3|url=http://www.stevegoldman.com/Publications/AboutSG/1989-07-02%20OBJ%20-%20Maitland%20Manufacturer's%20Electronic%20Part%20Becomes%20Darling%20of%20Computer%20Trade.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obj9:19/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44913">'''E-services''' (electronic services) are services which use of [[Information and communication technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs). The three main components of e-services are- service provider, service receiver and the channels of service delivery (i.e., technology). For example, as concerned to public e-service, public agencies are the service provider and citizens as well as businesses are the service receiver. The channel of service delivery is the third requirement of e-service. Internet is the main channel of e-service delivery while other classic channels (e.g. telephone, call center, public kiosk, mobile phone, television) are also considered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Rowley, J. (2006) An analysis of the e-service literature: towards a research agenda. Internet Research, 16 (3), 339-359&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in the late 1980s in Europe{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and formal introduction in 1993 by the US Government,&lt;ref&gt;Alasem, A. (2009). An Overview of e-Government Metadata Standards and Initiatives based on Dublin Core. Electronic Journal of e-Government, 7(1), 1 – 10&lt;/ref&gt; the term ‘[[E-Government]]’ has now become one of the recognized research domains especially in the context of public policy and now has been rapidly gaining strategic importance in public sector modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer, M., Codagnone, C. and Janssen, M. (2008) “Future of e-Government Research: 13 research themes identified in the eGovRTD2020 project’. Proceedings of the 41st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, USA&lt;/ref&gt; E-service is one of the branches of this domain and its attention has also been creeping up among the practitioners and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Lӧfstedt, U. (2005) ‘Assessment of current research and some proposals for future direction’, International Journal of Public IS&lt;/ref&gt;

E-service (or eservice) is a highly generic term, usually referring to ‘The provision of services via the Internet (the prefix 'e' standing for ‘electronic’, as it does in many other usages), thus e-Service may also include e-Commerce, although it may also include non-commercial services (online), which is usually provided by the government.’ (Irma Buntantan &amp; G. David Garson, 2004: 169-170; Muhammad Rais &amp; Nazariah, 2003: 59, 70-71).

"E-Service constitutes the online services available on the Internet, whereby a valid transaction of buying and selling (procurement) is possible, as opposed to the traditional websites, whereby only descriptive information are available, and no online transaction is made possible." (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of E-service ==
Lu (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J. (2001). Measuring cost/benefits of e-business applications and customer satisfaction”, Proceedings of the 2nd International Web Conference, 29–30 November, Perth, Australia, 139-47&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a number of benefits for e-services, some of these are:

* Accessing a greater customer base
* Broadening market reach
* Lowering of entry barrier to new markets and cost of acquiring new customers
* Alternative communication channel to customers
* Increasing services to customers
* Enhancing perceived company image
* Gaining competitive advantages
* Enhancing transparency 
* Potential for increasing [[Customer knowledge]]

==Importance and advantages of E-shopping==
*E-shops are open 24 hours a day.
*There is no need to travel to the malls or wait at the checkout counters.
*There is usually a wide selection of goods and services.
*It is easy to compare prices and quality by using the E-shopping tool.
*Price reduction and discounts are electronically conveyed.

==E-service domain==
The term ‘e-service’ has many applications and can be found in many disciplines. The two dominant application areas of e-services are

E-business (or e-commerce): e-services mostly provided by businesses or [NGO|non-government organizations] (NGOs) (private sector).

E-government: e-services provided by government to citizens or business (public sector is the supply side). The use and description of the e-service in this page will be limited to the context of e-government only where of the e-service is usually associated with prefix “public”: Public e-services. In some cases, we will have to describe aspects that are related to both fields like some conferences or journals which cover the concept of “e-Service” in both domains of e-government and [[e-business]].[example:[https://web.archive.org/web/20180125141728/http://eserviceforyou.com/] www.eserviceforyou.com]

==Architecture==
Depending on the types of services, there are certain functionalities required in the certain layers of e-service architectural framework, these include but are not limited to – Data layer (data sources), processing layers (customer service systems, management systems, data warehouse systems, integrated customer content systems), exchange layer ([[Enterprise application integration|Enterprise Application Integration]]– EAI), interaction layer ( integrating e-services), and presentation layer (customer interface through which the web pages and e-services are linked).

==E-service quality==
Measuring [[service quality]] and service excellence are important in a competitive organizational environment. The [[SERVQUAL]]- service quality model is one of the widely used tools for measuring quality of the service on various aspects. The five attributes of this model are: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, tangibles, and empathy. The following table summarizes some major of these:

The [[LIRNEasia]] study on benchmarking national telecom regulator websites focuses on content than on accessibility and ease of use, unlike the other studies mentioned here. Websites are increasingly important portals to government agencies, especially in the context of [[information society]] reforms. Stakeholders, including businesses, investors and even the general public, are interested in information produced by these agencies, and websites can help to increase their transparency and accountability. The quality of its website also demonstrates how advanced a regulatory agency is.

==E-service cost factor==
Some major cost factors are (Lu, 2001):&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J. (2001). Measuring cost/benefits of e-business applications and customer
satisfaction”, Proceedings of the 2nd International Web Conference, 29–30 November, Perth, Australia, 139-47&lt;/ref&gt;

* Expense of setting up applications
* Maintaining applications
* Internet connection
* Hardware/software
* Security concerns
* legal issues
* Training; and
* Rapid technology changes

==Practical examples of e-services in the Developing World==
Information technology is a powerful tool for accelerating economic development. Developing countries have focused on the development of ICT during the last two decades and as a result, it has been recognized that ICT is critical to economy and is as a catalyst of economic development. So, in recent years there seems to have been efforts for providing various e-services in many developing countries since ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-Government and as a result, e-Services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Ndou, V.(2004)E-Government for developing countries: Opportunities and Challenges, EJISDC 18, 1, 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Many government agencies in developed countries have taken progressive steps toward the web and ICT use, adding coherence to all local activities on the Internet, widening local access and skills, opening up interactive services for local debates, and increasing the participation of citizens on promotion and management of the territory(Graham and Aurigi, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S. and Aurigi, A. (1997) Virtual Cities, Social Polarisation, and the Crisis in Urban Public Space, Journal of Urban Technology, 4, 1, 19-52&lt;/ref&gt;

But the potential for e-government in developing countries remains largely unexploited, even though. ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-government. Different human, organizational and technological factors,
issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. ICT, in general, is referred to as an “enabler”, but on the other hand, it should also be regarded as a challenge and a peril in itself. The organizations, public or private, which ignore the potential value and use of ICT may suffer pivotal competitive disadvantages. Nevertheless, some e-government initiatives have flourished in developing countries too, e.g. Brazil, India, Chile, etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; What the experience in these countries shows, is that governments in the developing world can effectively exploit and appropriate the benefits of ICT, but e-government success entails the accommodation of certain unique conditions, needs and obstacles. The adaptive challenges of e-government go far beyond technology, they call for organizational structures and skills, new forms of leadership, transformation of public-private partnerships (Allen et al., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Allen, A.B., Juillet, L., Paquet, G. and Roy, J. (2001) E-Governance and Government Online in Canada: Partnerships, People and Prospects, Government Information Quarterly,18, 93-104.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following are a few examples regarding e-services in some developing countries:

===E-services in Bangladesh===
Bangladesh first e-service system is National E-Service System ([http://www.eservice.gov.bd/[ NESS]]) and 2nd e-Service For you [http://eserviceforyou.com/[eserviceforyou.com]]. 

===E-services in Rwanda===
Only a decade after emerging from the fastest genocide of the 20th Century, Rwanda, a small country in Eastern Central Africa,
has become one of the continent’s leaders in, and model on, bridging the digital divide through e-government. Rwanda has undergone a rapid turnaround from one of the most technologically deficient countries only a decade ago to a country
where legislative business is conducted online and wireless access to the Internet is available anywhere in the country. This is
puzzling when viewed against the limited progress made in other comparable developing countries, especially those located in the
same region, sub-Saharan Africa, where the structural and institutional constraints to e-government diffusion are similar.&lt;ref&gt;Mawangi, W.(2006) The social relations of e-government diffusion in developing countries: the case of Rwanda, Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Digital government research, May 21–24, 2006, San Diego, California&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-services in South Africa===
In South Africa, there continues to be high expectations of government in respect to improved delivery of service and of closer consultation with citizens. Such expectations are not unique to this country, and in this regard there is a need for governments to recognise that the implementation of e-government systems and e-services affords them the opportunity to enhance service delivery and good governance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;van Brakel, P.A.(2009) Proceedings of the 11th Annual Conference on World Wide Web Applications, Port Elizabeth, 2–4 September&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of e-Government has been widely acclaimed in that it provides new impetus to deliver services quickly and efficiently (Evans &amp; Yen, 2006:208).&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D. &amp; Yen, D. C. 2006. e-Government: evolving relationship of citizens and government, domestic, and international development. Government Information Quarterly, 23(2): 207-235.)&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of these benefits, various arms of the South African government have embarked on a number of e-government programmes for example the [http://www.gov.za/  Batho Pele portal], [[Sars efiling|SARS e-filing]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405043644/http://www.enatis.com/  e-Natis system], electronic processing of grant applications from remote sites, and a large number of departmental information websites. Also a number of well publicised e-government ventures such as the latter, analysts and researchers consider the state of e-government in South Africa to be at rudimentary stages. There are various factors
which collectively contribute to such an assessment. Amongst these, key factors relate to a lack of a clear strategy to facilitate uptake and adoption of e-government services as well as evaluation frameworks to assess expectations of citizens who are one of the primary user groups of these services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===E-services in Malaysia===
E-Services is one of the pilot projects under the Electronic Government Flagship within the Multimedia Super Corridor ([http://www.mscmalaysia.my/  MSC]) initiative. With E-Services, one can now conduct transactions with Government agencies, such as the Road Transport Department (RTD) and private utility companies such as Tenaga Nasional Berhad ([http://www.tnb.com.my TNB]) and Telekom Malaysia Berhad ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100529003757/http://www.tm.net.my/  TM]) through various convenient channels such as the eServices kiosks and internet. No more queuing, traffic jams or bureaucratic hassles and one can now conduct transaction at one’s own convenience. Also, Electronic Labour Exchange ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100721234322/http://www.elx.gov.my/  ELX])is one stop-centre for labor market information, as supervised by the Ministry of Human Resource ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100419184753/http://www.mohr.gov.my/ MOHR]), to enable employers and job seekers to communicate on the same platform.

[http://www.esyariah.gov.my/  e-Syariah] is the seventh project under the Electronic Government flagship application of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC). A case management system that integrates the processes related to management of cases for the Syariah Courts.

== Examples of E-services in Established Countries ==

=== E-services in the United States of America ===
In America, citizens have many options and opportunities to follow and understand government actions through e-government. [[Government 2.0]] (Gov. 2.0) is currently in place to bring the people and governments together to learn new information, increase government transparency, and better means for communicating to one another. Gov. 2.0 offers increased citizen participation through on-line applications such as social media and other apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinempa.unc.edu/a-citizens-guide-to-open-government-e-government-and-government-2-0/|title=A Citizen's Guide to Open Government, E-Government, and Government 2.0|last=Harper|first=Logan|date=June 10, 2013|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the internet and websites such as USA.gov, an individual can perform actions such as contacting elected officials, find information about the work force such as retirement plans and labor laws, learn about money and consumer issues such as taxes, loans, and welfare, learn about citizenship and obtaining a visa or passport, and other topics such as health and welfare, education, and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usa.gov|title=USA.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E-commerce]] is another growing E-service in the United States for both big and small businesses. E-commerce sales are projected to grow 10 to 12 percent annually. [[Amazon.com]] is the largest on-line marketplace in the country with annual sales of $79 billion. [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] is also a widely popular retailer. They have grown their business by having electronic services. Wal-Mart’s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was roughly $13 billion. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] develops and sells a wide variety of technological goods and services such as cell phones, music players, and computers. Apple’s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceoworld.biz/2016/03/08/americas-top-25-e-commerce-retailers-sales/|title=CEO Insiders: America's Top 25 E-commerce Retailers by Sales|last=Bhushan|first=Dr. Amarendra|date=March 8, 2016|website=CEOWorld Magazine|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-services allows businesses to reach new clientele and offer new services. Companies such as [[eBay]] and [[Etsy]] have achieved great success, with eBay posting a net income in 2016 of nearly $9 billion and Esty claiming roughly $200 million in profits from nearly $2 billion sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/27/how-e-commerce-helps-us-small-businesses-go-global.html|title=How e-commerce helps US small businesses go global|last=Rogers|first=Kate|date=April 27, 2015|website=CNBC|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority or eBay's business is conducted in the United States but it does a great deal of international business including the United Kingdom and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/2181/ebay/|title=eBay - Statistics &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global reach of Etsy is seen in nearly every country in the world with 31% of gross merchandise sales occurring outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amigobulls.com/articles/etsy-ipo-all-you-need-to-know-about-etsy|title=Etsy IPO: All You Need To Know About Etsy|last=Nagarkar|first=Vikram|date=March 19, 2015|website=Amigobulls|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-services in China ===
China’s recent realization of the continuing growth of internet usage has caused the government to recognize the need to expand their E-government services. Some steps the government wants to take in order to increase their E-government services are to develop more online functions, use government sites to integrate on-line services, have supplementary open data available to citizens to further government transparency, and to combine services from local and country-wide governments for convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|title=China Gets the E-Gov Love Bug|last=Sharwood|first=Simon|date=September 15, 2016|website=The Register|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916031541/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; China’s plan of action to incorporate the internet into everyday business and grow the economy is known as “[[Internet Plus]].” The government plans to have this plan in full effect by 2025 to be the main driving force for economic and social improvements. Internet Plus will help to grow the job market as the government plans to use local citizens for development, and to generate more areas dedicated to technological growth such as [[Zhongguancun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/business/2015-07/04/content_35980397.htm|title='Internet Plus' action plan unveiled|last=Xinhua|first=|date=July 4, 2015|website=China.org|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the large population, China has the most internet and cell phone users in the world.(consider rewording)  This causes a need for technological growth and a demand for increased E-services. In 2016, Chinese consumers spent more money for on-line goods and services than the United States and United Kingdom combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/chinas-consumers-outspending-americans-and-british-online-2398441519.html|title=Chinese E-Commerce Boom — Bigger Than US, UK Combined|last=Vavra|first=Shannon|date=May 8, 2017|website=axios.com|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is(are) a wide variety of reasons as to why E-commerce flourishes in China including easy access to mobile internet, low cost of shipping, and a vast selection of cheap, unbranded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/macroeconomic-insights/growth-of-china/chinese-consumer/index.html?cid=PS_01_50_07_00_01_15_01&amp;mkwid=uui8CuV3|title=The Rise of China's New Consumer Class|last=|first=|date=|website=Goldman Sachs|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] is China’s largest on-line marketplace with an annual revenue stream of $16 billion.

==Challenges to e-services in the Developing World==
The future of e-service is bright but some challenges remain. There are some challenges in e-service, as Sheth &amp; Sharma (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Sheth., J.N., Sharma, A., (2007). E-Services: A framework for growth.  Journal of Value Chain Management, 1(1/2)&lt;/ref&gt; identify, are:

* Low penetration of ICT especially in the developing countries;
* [[Internet fraud|Fraud]] on the internet space which is estimated around 2.8billion USD
* [[Internet privacy|Privacy]] due the emergence of various types of spyware and security holes, and
* intrusive characteristics of the service (e.g. mobile phones based) as customers may not like to be contacted with the service providers at any time and at any place.

The first challenge and primary obstacle to the e-service platform will be penetration of the internet. In some developing countries, the access to the internet is limited and speeds are also limited. In these cases firms and customers will continue to use traditional platforms. The second issue of concern is fraud on the internet. It is anticipated that the fraud on the e-commerce internet space costs $2.8 billion. Possibility of fraud will continue to reduce the utilization of the internet. The third issue is of privacy. Due to both spyware and security holes in operating systems, there is concern that the transactions that consumers undertake have privacy limitations.  For example, by stealthily following online activities, firms can develop fairly accurate descriptions of customer profiles.  Possibility of privacy violations will reduce the utilizations of the internet. The final issue is that e-service can also become intrusive as they reduce time and location barriers of other forms of contract. For example, firms can contact people through mobile devices at any time and at any place. Customers do not take like the intrusive behavior and may not use the e-service platform. (Heiner and lyer, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Heiner and lyer (2007) E-Service opportunities and Threats, Journal of value chain management, 1, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major e-service keywords==
A considerable amount of research efforts already exists on the subject matter exploring different aspects of e-service and e-service delivery ; one worth noting effort is Rowley’s study (2006)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; who did a review study on the e-service literature. The key finding of his study is that there is need to explore dimensions of e-service delivery not focusing only on service quality “In order to understand e-service experiences it is necessary to go beyond studies of e-service quality dimensions and to also take into account the inherent characteristics of e-service delivery and the factors that differentiate one service experience from another.”

Some of the major keywords of e-service as found in the e-government research are as follows:

===Acceptance===
User acceptance of technology is defined according to Morris (1996, referred by Wu 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Philip F. (2009). User Acceptance of Emergency Alert Technology: A Case Study. Proceedings of the 6th International ISCRAM Conference – Gothenburg, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; as “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support”. This definition can be brought into the context of e-service where acceptance can be defined as the users’ willingness to use e-service or the willingness to decide when and how to use the e-service.

===Accessibility===
Users’ ability to access to the e-service is important theme in the previous literature. For example, Huang (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Huang, C.J. (2003). Usability of E-Government Web Sites for People with Disabilities, In Proceedings of the 36th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS’03), IEEE Computer Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; finds that most of the websites in general fail to serve users with disabilities. Recommendation to improve accessibility is evident in previous literature including Jaeger (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, P.T. Assessing Section 508 compliance on federal e-government Web sites: A multi-method, user-centered evaluation of accessibility for persons with disabilities. Government Information Quarterly 23 (2006) 169–190&lt;/ref&gt; who suggests the following to improve e-services’ accessibility like: design for accessibility from the outset of website development, Involve users with disabilities in the testing of the site …Focus on the benefits of an accessible Web site to all users.

===Administrative literacy===
According to Grönlund et al. (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Grönlund, Å., Hatakka, M. and Ask, A. (2007) ‘ Inclusion in the E-Service Society – Investigating Administrative Literacy Requirements for Using E-Services’. 6th International Conference (EGOV 2007, Regensburg, Germany), 4656&lt;/ref&gt; for a simple e-service, the needs for knowledge and skills, content and procedures are considerably less. However, in complicated services there are needed to change some prevailed skills, such as replacing verbal skills with skill in searching for information online.

===Benchmarking===
This theme is concerned with establishing standards for measuring e-services or the best practices within the field. This theme also includes the international benchmarking of e-government services (UN reports, EU reports); much critic has been targeting these reports being incomprehensive and useless. According to Bannister (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Bannister F. (2007). The curse of the benchmark: an assessment of the validity and value of e-government comparisons, International Review of Administrative Sciences, 73 (2), 171-188&lt;/ref&gt; “… benchmarks are not a reliable tool for measuring real e-government progress. Furthermore, if they are poorly designed, they risk distorting government policies as countries may chase the benchmark rather than looking at real local and national needs”

===Digital divide===
[[Digital divide]] is considered one of the main barriers to implementing e-services; some people do not have means to access the e-services and some others do not know how to use the technology (or the e-service). According to Helbig et al. (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Helbig, N; Gil-García, J ; Ferro, E (2009). Understanding the complexity of electronic government: Implications from the digital divide literature. Government Information Quarterly, 26(2009), 89–97&lt;/ref&gt; “we suggest E-Government and the digital divide should be seen as complementary social phenomena (i.e., demand and supply). Moreover, a serious e-government digital divide is that services mostly used by social elites."

===E-readiness===
Most of the reports and the established criteria focus on assessing the services in terms of infrastructure and public policies ignoring the citizen participation or [[e-readiness]]. According to by Shalini (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Shalini, R. (2009). Are Mauritians ready for e-Government services?. Government Information Quarterly 26 (2009) 536–539&lt;/ref&gt; “the results of the research project reveal that a high [http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=eiu_2007_e_readiness_rankings&amp;rf=0|e-readiness index] may be only indicating that a country is e-ready in terms of ICT infrastructure and info-structure, institutions, policies, and political commitment, but it is a very poor measure of the e-readiness of citizens. To summarize the findings, it can be said that Mauritius is ready but the Mauritians are not”

``E-readiness, as the Economist Intelligence Unit defines, is the measure of a country’s ability to leverage digital channels for communication, commerce and government in order to further economic and social development. Implied in this measure is the extent to which the usage of communications devices and Internet services creates efficiencies for business and citizens, and the extent to which this usage is leveraged in the development of information and communications technology (ICT) industries. In general terms, the definition of e-readiness is relative, for instance depending on a country in question's priorities and perspective.&lt;ref&gt;GeoSINC International (2002). E-Readiness Guide. Available at http://www.apdip.net/documents/evaluation/e-readiness/geosinc01042002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficiency===
As opposed to effectiveness, efficiency is focused on the internal competence within the government departments when delivering e-services. There is a complaint that researchers focus more on effectiveness “There is an emerging trend seemingly moving away from the efficiency target and focusing on users and governance outcome. While the latter is worthwhile, efficiency must still remain a key priority for eGovernment given the budget constraints compounded in the future by the costs of an ageing population. Moreover, efficiency gains are those that can be most likely proven empirically through robust methodologies”&lt;ref&gt;Codagnone, C.  Undheim T.A (2008).  Benchmarking eGovernment: tools, theory, and practice. European Journal of ePractice. Nº 4 • August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
Security is the most important challenge that faces the implementation of e-services because without a guarantee of privacy and security citizens will not be willing to take up e-government services. These security concerns, such as hacker attacks and the theft of credit card information, make governments hesitant to provide public online services.  According to the GAO report&lt;ref&gt;GAO.(2002). E-Government: Proposal addresses Critical Challenges. U.S General Accounting Office, Govt of the USA&lt;/ref&gt; of 2002 “security concerns present one of the toughest challenges to extending the reach of e-government.The rash of hacker attacks, Web page defacing, and credit card information being posted on electronic bulletin boards can make many federal agency officials—as well as the general public—reluctant to conduct sensitive government transactions involving personal or financial data over the Internet.” By and Large,  Security is one of the major challenges that faces the implementation and development of electronic services. people want to be assured that they are safe when they are conducting online services and that their information will remain secure and confidential

===Stakeholders===
Axelsson et al. (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Axelsson, K, Melin, f, Lindgren, I, (2009) DEVELOPING PUBLIC E-SERVICES FOR SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS – A MULTIFACETED VIEW OF THE NEEDS FOR AN E-SERVICE. 17th European Conference on Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the stakeholder concept-which was originally used in private firms-, can be used in public setting and in the context of e-government. According to them, several scholars have discussed the use of the [[stakeholder theory]] in public settings.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, H. J. (2001). Applying stakeholder theory to e-government: Benefits and Limits. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; The stakeholder theory suggests that need to focus on all the involved stakeholder s when designing the e-service; not only on the government and citizens.

===Usability===
Compared to Accessibility, There is sufficient literature that addresses the issue of usability; researchers have developed different models and methods to measure the usability and effectiveness of eGovernment websites. However, But still there is call to improve these measures and make it more compressive&lt;ref&gt;Kaylor, C.,  Deshazo, R. &amp; Eck, D. V. (2001) "Gauging e-government: A report on implementing services among American cities". Government Information Quarterly (GIQ), 18(4), 293 - 307&lt;/ref&gt;

``The word usability has cropped up a few times already in this unit. In the context of biometric identification, usability referred to the smoothness of enrollment and other tasks associated with setting up an identification system. A system that produced few false matches during enrollment of applicants was described as usable. Another meaning of usability is related to the ease of use of an interface. Although this meaning of the term is often used in the context of computer interfaces, there is no reason to confine it to computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=211245 Open Learning - OpenLearn - Open University]&lt;/ref&gt;´´

==Social, cultural and ethical implications of e-services==
The perceived effectiveness of e-service can be influenced by public’s view of the social and cultural implications of e-technologies and e-service.

Impacts on individuals’ rights and privacy – as more and more companies and government agencies use technology to collect, store, and make accessible data on individuals, privacy concerns have grown. Some companies monitor their employees' computer usage patterns in order to assess individual or workgroup performance.&lt;ref&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002). Strategic Management of Information systems and Technology in an e-World”, Proceedings of the 21st IT Conference, Sri Lanka, pp103-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancements are also making it much easier for businesses, government and other individuals to obtain a great deal of information about an individual without their knowledge. There is a growing concern&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002b) “e-Governance in Asia Pacific”, Proceedings of the International Conference on Governance in Asia, Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt; that access to a wide range of information can be dangerous within politically corrupt government agencies.

Impact on Jobs and Workplaces - in the early days of computers, management scientists anticipated that computers would replace human decision-makers. However, despite significant technological advances, this prediction is no longer a mainstream concern. At the current time, one of the concerns associated with computer usage in any organization (including governments) is the health risk – such as injuries related to working continuously on a computer keyboard. Government agencies are expected to work with regulatory groups in order to avoid these problems.

Potential Impacts on Society – despite some economic benefits of ICT to individuals, there is evidence that the computer literacy and access gap between the haves and have-nots may be increasing. Education and information access are more than ever the keys to economic prosperity, yet access by individuals in different countries is not equal - this social inequity has become known as the digital divide.

Impact on Social Interaction – advancements in ICT and e-Technology solutions have enabled many government functions to become automated and information to be made available online. This is a concern to those who place a high value on social interaction.

Information Security - technological advancements allow government agencies to collect, store and make data available online to individuals and organizations. Citizens and businesses expect to be allowed to access data in a flexible manner (at any time and from any location). Meeting these expectations comes at a price to government agencies where it concerns managing information – more specifically, ease of access; data integrity and accuracy; capacity planning to ensure the timely delivery of data to remote (possibly mobile) sites; and managing the security of corporate and public information.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==E-service awards==
The benefits of e-services in advancing businesses efficiency and in promoting good governance are huge; recognizing the importance of these benefits has resulted in number of international awards that are dedicated to recognize the best designed e-services. In the section, we will provide description of some international awards

The '''Engineer's Ring''' is a ring worn by members of the United States [[Order of the Engineer]], a [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies|fellowship]] of [[engineer]]s who must be a certified Professional Engineer or graduated from an accredited engineering program (or be within one academic year of graduation to participate).&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;[http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/?page_id=17 Order of the Engineer FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The ring is usually a [[stainless steel]] band worn on the [[pinky ring|little finger]] of the dominant hand.&lt;ref name="order pdf"&gt;[http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Ceremony.pdf Manual for Conducting Order of the EngineerInduction Ceremonies]&lt;/ref&gt; This is so that it makes contact with all work done by the engineer. Rings used to be cast in iron in the most unattractive and simple form to show the nature of work. The ring is symbolic of the oath taken by the wearer, and symbolizes the unity of the profession in its goal of benefitting mankind. The stainless steel from which the ring is made depicts the strength of the profession.&lt;ref name="order pdf"/&gt;

Starting in 1970,&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; it is inspired by the original Canadian [[Iron Ring]] ceremony that started in 1922. Engineers receive the ring after taking an oath known as [[#The Obligation of The Engineer|The Obligation of The Engineer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/?page_id=251|title=Ceremony Manual|last=|first=|date=2011-11-01|website=Order Of The Engineer|page=iv|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a ring ceremony. Only those who have met the standards of [[professional engineering]] training or experience are able to accept the Obligation, which is voluntarily received for life.

==The Obligation of The Engineer==
The required oath, taken immediately before accepting the Engineer's Ring, is known as "The Obligation of the Engineer" and is as follows:

{{Quote|text=
''I am an Engineer.''
''In my profession I take deep pride.''
''To it I owe solemn obligations.''

''As an engineer, I, (full name), pledge to practice Integrity and Fair Dealing, Tolerance, and Respect,'' 
''and to uphold devotion to the standards and dignity of my profession,''
''conscious always that my skill carries with it the obligation to serve humanity''
''by making best use of the Earth's precious wealth.''

''As an engineer, I shall participate in none but honest enterprises.''
''When needed, my skill and knowledge shall be given without reservation for the public good.''
''In the performance of duty, and in fidelity to my profession, I shall give the utmost.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">An '''explosive-driven ferroelectric generator''' ('''EDFEG''', '''explosively pumped ferroelectric generator''', '''EPFEG''', or '''FEG''') is a compact [[pulsed power]] generator, a device used for generation of short high-[[voltage]] high-[[electric current|current]] pulse. The energies available are fairly low, in the range of single joules, the voltages range in tens of kilovolts to over 100 kV, and the powers range in hundreds of kilowatts to megawatts.&lt;ref name=eppbook&gt;{{cite book |author1=Larry L. Altgilbers |author2=Jason Baird |author3=Bruce L. Freeman |author4=Christopher S. Lynch |author5=Sergey I.

ECFEGs operate by releasing the electrical charge stored in the [[poling (piezoelectricity)|poled]] crystal structure of a suitable [[ferroelectric material]], e.g. [[lead zirconate titanate|PZT]], by an intense mechanical shock.[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F4520397%2F4530649%2F04530693.pdf%3Farnumber%3D4530693&amp;authDecision=-203] They are a kind of [[phase transition]] generators.

The structure of an EDFEG is generally a block of a suitable [[high explosive]], accelerating a metal plate into a target made of ferroelectric material.[http://www.lokiconsult.com/products.html]

FEGs find multiple uses due to their compact character; charging banks of capacitors, initiation of [[slapper detonator]] arrays in [[nuclear weapon]]s and other devices, driving [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, powering pulsed [[neutron generator]]s, seed power sources for stronger pulse generators (e.g. [[EPFCG]]s), [[electromagnetic pulse]] generators, [[Directed-energy weapon|electromagnetic weapon]]s, [[vector inversion generator]]s, etc.

A 2.4 megawatt [[HERF]] generator (an EDFEG with a [[pulse forming network]] directly driving a [[dipole antenna]]) with peak output frequency at 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz was demonstrated.[http://przyrbwn.icm.edu.pl/APP/PDF/115/a115z630.pdf]

In the [[European Union]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/85 |title=Chapter 4: The Internet Threat |work=The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind |first=James |last=Boyle}}&lt;/ref&gt; a '''green paper''' is a tentative government report and consultation document of [[policy]] proposals for debate and discussion. A green paper represents the best that the government can propose on the given issue, but, remaining uncommitted, it is able without loss of face to leave its final decision open until it has been able to consider the public reaction to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82326.stm |title=Green Paper |publisher=BBC News | date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green papers may result in the production of a [[white paper]]. They may be considered as [[grey literature]].

==Canada==
A green paper in [[Canada]], like a white paper, is an official government document. Green papers tend to be statements not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussion. They are produced early in the policy-making process, while ministerial proposals are still being formulated. Many white papers in Canada have been, in effect, green papers, while at least one green paper—that on immigration and population in 1975—was released for public debate after the government had already drafted [[legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/green-paper |title=Green Paper |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Similarly, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], green papers are official consultation documents produced by the government for discussion both inside and outside [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], for instance when a government department is considering introducing a new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/green-papers/ |title=Green Papers |publisher=The UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/careandsupportreform/what-green-paper|title=What is a Green Paper?|date=2009-06-18|website=The Guardian|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
A green paper released by the [[European Commission]] is a discussion document intended to stimulate debate and launch a process of consultation, at European level, on a particular topic. A green paper usually presents a range of ideas and is meant to invite interested individuals or organizations to contribute views and information. It may be followed by a white paper, an official set of proposals that is used as a vehicle for their development into law.

==Examples==
===Discussion of defence policy in Australia, 2000===
A major review of [[defence policy]] in [[Australia]] culminated in a white paper issued in December 2000. Prior to this, a discussion paper was released in June 2000. This discussion paper was in nature what is known as a green paper (and was sometimes referred to as such).

===Copyright in the knowledge economy, 2008===
The purpose of the 2008 EU green paper on [[copyright]] was to foster a debate on how knowledge for research, science and education can best be disseminated in the online environment. The green paper, which was published on 16 July 2008, aimed to set out a number of issues connected with the role of copyright in the "[[knowledge economy]]" and intended to launch a consultation on these issues (see [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/copyright-infso/greenpaper_en.pdf this document]). The EU asked for answers and comments to be submitted up to 30 November 2008.

[[Multitrack recording]] of sound is the process in which sound and other electro-acoustic signals are captured on a recording medium such as [[magnetic tape]], which is divided into two or more audio tracks that run parallel with each other. Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronisation, while allowing multiple sound sources to be recorded asynchronously. The first system for creating [[stereophonic sound]] (using [[telephone]] technology) was demonstrated by [[Clément Ader]] in Paris in 1881. The [[pallophotophone]], invented by [[Charles A. Hoxie]] and first demonstrated in 1922, recorded optically on 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, and some versions used a format of as many as twelve tracks in parallel on each strip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gereports.com/edison-speaks-cracking-the-pallophotophone-code/ Edison speaks! Cracking the pallophotophone code | GE Reports&lt;!-- bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were recorded one at a time in separate passes and were not intended for later [[Audio mixing|mixdown]] or stereophony; as with later half-track and quarter-track monophonic tape recording, the multiple tracks simply multiplied the maximum recording time possible, greatly reducing cost and bulk. British [[EMI]] engineer [[Alan Blumlein]] patented systems for recording stereophonic sound and [[surround sound]] on disc and film in 1933. The history of modern multitrack audio recording using magnetic tape began in 1943 with the invention of [[stereo]] tape recording, which divided the recording head into two tracks.

The next major development in multitrack recording came in the mid-1950s, when the [[Ampex]] corporation devised the concept of 8-track recording, utilizing its "Sel-Sync" (Selective Synchronous) recording system, and sold the first such machine to musician [[Les Paul]]&lt;ref name="snyder"&gt;[http://aes-media.org/historical/pdf/snyder_sel-sync.pdf ARSC Journal, Sel-sync and the "Octopus": How Came to be the First Recorder to Minimize Successive Copying in Overdubs]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, for the next 35 years, multitrack audio recording technology was largely confined to specialist radio, TV and music recording studios, primarily because multitrack tape machines were both very large and very expensive - the first Ampex 8-track recorder, installed in Les Paul's home studio in 1957, cost a princely US$10,000 - roughly three times the [[Average Indexed Monthly Earnings#Indexing yearly income|US average yearly income]] in 1957, and equivalent to around $90,000 in 2016. However, this situation changed radically in 1979 with the introduction of the TASCAM [[Portastudio]], which used the inexpensive [[compact audio cassette]] as the recording medium, making good-quality 4-track (and later 8-track) multitrack recording available to the average consumer for the first time. Ironically, by the time the Portastudio had become popular, electronics companies were already introducing digital audio recording systems, and by the 1990s, computer-based digital multitrack recording systems such as [[Pro Tools]] and [[Cubase]] were being adopted by the recording industry, and soon became standard. By the early 2000s, rapid advances in home computing and digital audio software were making digital multitrack audio recording systems available to the average consumer, and high-quality digital multitrack recording systems like [[GarageBand]] were being included as a standard feature on home computers.

==Overview==
Stereo sound recording on tape was perfected in 1943 by German audio engineers working for the [[AEG]] corporation. Around 250 stereo tape recordings were made during this period (of which only three have survived), but the technology remained a closely guarded secret within Germany until the end of World War II. After the war, American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] and the [[Ampex]] corporation pioneered the commercial development of tape recording in the USA, and the technology was rapidly taken up by radio and the music industry due to its superior sound fidelity and because tape - being a linear recording medium - could be easily edited, by physically cutting and splicing the tape, to remove unwanted elements and create a 'perfect' recording. 2-track tape recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently, which in turn facilitated the rapid expansion of the consumer high-fidelity ("HiFi") market. Stereo (either true binaural two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many pop music and jazz  recordings continued to be issued in monophonic sound until the late 1960s.

Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician [[Les Paul]], who lent his name to Gibson's first solid-body electric guitar. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer [[Mary Ford]]. But it was [[Patti Page]] who was the first vocalist to record her own voice, sound on sound, with a song called [[Confess_(song)|'Confess']], in 1947: Bill Putnam, an engineer for Mercury Records, was able to overdub Page's voice, due to his well-known use of technology. Thus, Page became the first pop artist to overdub her vocals on a song. This was months before [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]] had their first multi-voiced release. Paul was the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously — that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them. In 1963, solo jazz pianist, Bill Evans, recorded [[Conversations with Myself (album)|Conversations with Myself]], an innovative solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself, in effect creating a two-piano duet of jazz improvisations.

Despite [[Ampex]] having created the first 8-track tape machines for [[Les Paul]] and [[Atlantic Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/Remembering_Ahmet_Ertegun_and_Atlantics_Early_Years |title=Remembering Ahmet Ertegun and Atlantic’s Early Years |publisher=BMI|date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, multitrack recording was taken up in a more limited way in the industry via 3-track recorders. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings — including many of [[Phil Spector]]'s so-called "Wall of Sound" productions and early [[Motown]] hits — were taped on 3-track recorders.

The next evolution was 4-track recording, which was the studio standard through the mid 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]] became particularly adept at the technique called "reduction mixes" in the UK and "bouncing down" in the United States, in which multiple tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.

By the mid-1960s, the ready availability of the most up-to-date multitrack recorders - which were by then standard equipment in the leading Los Angeles recording studios - enabled [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]] to become one of the first pop producers to exploit the huge potential of multitrack recording. During the group's most innovative period of music-making, from 1964 to 1967, Wilson developed elaborate techniques for assembling the band's songs, which combined elements captured on both 4-track and 8-track recorders, as well as making extensive use of tape editing. By 1964, Wilson's increasingly complex arrangements had far outstripped the group's limited musical abilities - singer-guitarist [[Carl Wilson]] was the only group member who regularly contributed to these tracking sessions - so Wilson began routinely recording all the instrumental backing tracks for his songs using the team of top-rank professional studio musicians who came to be known as "[[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]]". For the group's landmark ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album in 1965, Wilson recorded all the album's elaborate backing tracks using The Wrecking Crew and other session musicians, while the Beach Boys were away touring; the session musicians typically performed these instrumental tracks as ensemble performances, which were recorded and mixed live, direct to a 4-track recorder. When the other Beach Boys returned from touring, they moved to Columbia's Hollywood studio, which was equipped with the latest 8-track technology; by this time, Wilson and his engineers had 'reduced' the pre-recorded 4-track backing tracks to a mono mix, which was then dubbed onto one track of the 8-track master tape; Wilson then recorded the vocal tracks, assigning one individual track to each of the six vocalists (including soon-to-be permanent member [[Bruce Johnston]]), leaving the eighth track available for final 'sweetening' elements, such as additional vocal or instrumental touches, and lastly, all these elements were mixed down to the mono master tape. Nearly all of the Beach Boys' 4-track and 8-track masters from this period are preserved in Capitol's archive, allowing the label to release several expansive boxed sets of this music; ''[[The Pet Sounds Sessions]]'' (1997), includes nearly all the separate backing and vocal tracks from the album, as well as new stereo mixes of all the songs, while the 9-CD ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' (2011) features a wide cross-section of the huge amount of instrumental and vocal material (totalling around 50 hours of recordings) that was recorded for the group's never-completed 1967 ''magnum opus'', ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.

All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing-down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still justly famed for the ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum.

4-track tape also led to a related development, [[quadraphonic]] sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums including Pink Floyd's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and Mike Oldfield's ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now sometimes considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the [[surround sound]] technology that has become standard in many modern home theater systems.

In a [[professional audio]] setting today, such as a [[recording studio]], [[audio engineer]]s may use 64 tracks or more for their recordings, utilizing one or more tracks for each instrument played.

The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing, and the ability to record multiple tracks, revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and mix down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of [[magnetic tape]] as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33⅓ rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on [[magnetic tape]], then transferred to disc, with [[Bing Crosby]] leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.

== Ampex's original 8-track recorder ==

The original Ampex 8-track recorder (not to be confused with [[8-track tape]] endless-loop cartridge players), model 5258, was an internal Ampex project.  It was based on an Ampex 1" data recorder transport with modified Ampex model 350 electronics.  It stood over {{convert|7|ft|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|250|lb|kg}}.  8 tracks were chosen because that was the number of {{convert|0.070|in|mm}} recording tracks with {{convert|0.060|in|mm}} guard tracks that would fit on a {{convert|1|in|mm}} recording tape, the widest tape available at the time.&lt;ref name="snyder" /&gt;

The first of the Ampex 8-track recorders was sold to [[Les Paul]] for $10,000 in 1957 and was installed in his home recording studio by [[David Sarser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reevesaudio.com/studiothree.html Studio 3: A Place of Recording Studio History...]&lt;/ref&gt;  It became known as the "Octopus".

The second Ampex model 5258 8-track was sold to [[Atlantic Records]] at [[Tom Dowd|Tom Dowd's]] insistence in late 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/arts/tom-dowd-77-an-innovator-in-the-art-of-recording-music.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Tom Dowd, 77, an Innovator In the Art of Recording Music | date=October 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic was the first record company to use a multi-track (as opposed to stereo or 3-track) recorder in their studio.

== Multi-channel recorders ==

Multi-track recording differs from [[overdubbing]] and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks.  Sound on sound which Les Paul invented adds a new performance to an existing recording by placing a second playback head in front of the erase head to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track.

Multi-track recorders also differ from early stereo and three track recorders that were available at the time in that they can record individual tracks while preserving the other tracks.  The original multi-channel recorders could only record all tracks at once.

The earliest multitrack recorders were analog magnetic tape machines with two or three tracks. [[Elvis Presley]] was first recorded on multitrack during 1957, as [[RCA]]'s engineers were testing their new machines. [[Buddy Holly]]'s last studio session in 1958 employed three-track, resulting in his only stereo releases not to include overdubs. The new three-track system allowed the lead vocal to be recorded on a dedicated track, while the remaining two tracks could be used to record the backing tracks in full stereo.

== Other early multi-track recorders ==

[[Frank Zappa]] experimented in the early 1960s with a custom built 5-track recorder built by engineer Paul Buff in his [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California]]. Buff later went on to work in larger Hollywood studios. However, recorders with four or more tracks were restricted mainly to major American recording studios until the mid-to-late 1960s, mainly because of import restrictions and the high cost of the technology. In England, pioneering independent producer [[Joe Meek]] produced all of his innovative early 1960s recordings using monophonic and two-track recorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleveland|first1=Barry|title=Joe Meek's Bold Techniques|date=2013|publisher=ElevenEleven|isbn=978-0-615-73600-6|pages=121|edition=Second|url=http://www.barrycleveland.com/jm-about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Meek, [[EMI]] house producer [[George Martin]] was considered an innovator for his use of two-track as a means to making better mono records, carefully balancing vocals and instruments; [[Abbey Road Studios]] installed Telefunken four-track machines in 1959 and 1960 (replaced in 1965 by smaller, more durable Studer machines), but [[The Beatles]] would not have access to them until late 1963, and all recordings prior to their first world hit single ''[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]'' (1964) were made on two-track machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Recording The Beatles |last= Kehew |first= Brian |publisher= Curvebender Publishing |author2=Kevin Ryan |pages= 216 |year= 2006 |isbn= 0-9785200-0-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on popular music==

The artistic potential of the multitrack recorder came to the attention of the public in the 1960s, when artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[the Beach Boys]] began to multitrack extensively, and from then on virtually all popular music was recorded in this manner. The technology developed very rapidly during these years. At the start of their careers, the Beatles and Beach Boys each recorded live to mono, two-track (the Beatles), or three-track (the Beach Boys); by 1965 they used multitracking to create pop music of unprecedented complexity.

The Beach Boys' acclaimed 1966 LP ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' relied on multitrack recorders for its innovative production. [[Brian Wilson]] pretaped all the instrumental backing tracks with a large ensemble, recording the performances live, direct to a four-track recorder. These four-track backing tapes were then '[[overdubbing|dubbed down]]' to one track of an eight-track tape. Six of the remaining seven tracks were then used to individually record the vocals of each member of The Beach Boys, and the eighth track was reserved for any final 'sweetening' overdubs of instruments or voices.

[[3M]] introduced the 1-inch eight-track version of their model M-23 recorder in 1966, probably the first mass-produced machine of this format.  It remained in production until 1970 and was used by many top studios worldwide including Abbey Road Studios in London.  Both [[Pete Townshend]] and [[John Lennon]] had 3M 8-track machines in their home [[project studio]]s c. 1969-1970.  Ampex began mass production of their competing 1-inch eight-track MM1000 in 1967.  One of the first 8-track machines in Los Angeles was built by [[Scully Recording Instruments]] of Bridgeport, Connecticut and installed at American Recorders in late 1967.  The [[Steppenwolf (Steppenwolf album)|debut album]] by [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] was recorded there and was released in January 1968.

Because The Beatles did not gain access to eight-track recorders until 1968, their groundbreaking ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' LP (1967) was created using pairs of four-track machines; the group also used [[vari-speed]] (also called [[pitch shift]]) to achieve unique sounds, and they were the first group in the world to use an important offshoot of multitrack recording, the [[Automatic Double Tracking]] (ADT) system invented by Abbey Road staff engineer [[Ken Townsend]] in 1966.

Other artists began experimenting with multitrack's possibilities also, with [[the Music Machine]] (of "Talk Talk" fame) recording on a custom-built ten-track setup, and [[Pink Floyd]] collaborating with former Beatles [[recording engineer]] [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman "Hurricane" Smith]], who produced their first albums.

The first eight-track recorder in the UK was built by Scully and installed at London's [[Advision Studios]] in early 1968.  Among the first eight-track recordings made there were the single ''[[Dogs (The Who song)|Dogs]]'' by [[The Who]] and the album ''[[My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows]]'' by the band [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]].  [[Trident Studios]] obtained their first eight-track recorder soon afterward.  It was during The Beatles' recording of their ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' sessions of late 1968 that [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]] finally had eight-track recorders installed, until then the group went to Trident to record with eight-tracks.  The Beatles used eight-track to record portions of  the ''White Album'', the single "[[Hey Jude]]" and the later ''[[Abbey Road]]''.

Other western countries also lagged well behind the USA – in [[Australia]], the largest local recording label, [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], did not install a four-track recorder until late 1966; the first eight-track recorders did not appear there until the late 1960s.

==Large format analog recorders==

In 1967 [[Ampex]] built its first prototype 16-track [[professional audio]] recorder at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City.  This machine used reels of 2-inch tape on a modified tape transport system originally built  for video recording.  In 1968 it introduced the 16-track production model MM-1000, the first commercially available 16-track machine.  Machines of this size are difficult to move and costly to maintain.  Prices were very high, typically $10,000 to $30,000 U.S. dollars.

One of the first 16-track recorders was installed at CBS Studios in [[New York City]] where it was used to record the second album by ''[[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears album)|Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]]'' released in December 1968.  The [[Grateful Dead]] released their first 16-track recordings ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]'' in June 1969 and ''[[Live/Dead]]'' in November 1969.  TTG Studios in [[Los Angeles]] built its own 16-track machine in 1968.  This was used on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' released in October 1969. ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'' by [[Jefferson Airplane]] was released in November 1969. The back of the Jefferson Airplane album cover includes a picture of the 16-track MM-1000.

Advision and Trident were also among the first in the U.K. to install 16-track machines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Trident installed its first 16-track machine in late 1969. "After The Flood", a song from the [[Van der Graaf Generator]] album ''[[The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other]]'', was recorded at this studio on 16 tracks in December 1969. Production of 16-track machines boomed and the number of studios worldwide using these machines exploded during 1970 and 1971.  By the end of 1971 there were at least 21 studios in London using 16-track recorders in conjunction with [[Dolby]] noise reduction.&lt;ref&gt;"Spotlight on London" Billboard Magazine, November 13, 1971 - advertisement, pg. L-26&lt;/ref&gt; Groups using Trident at this time also included [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[David Bowie]] as well as [[Queen (band)|Queen]] who experimented with multitracking extensively most prominently on their albums [[Queen II]] and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.

Australia's first sixteen-track recorder was installed at [[Armstrong's Studios]] in [[Melbourne]] in 1971; Festival installed Australia's first 24-track recorder at its Sydney studio in 1974.  During the 1970s, sixteen, twenty-four, and thirty-two tracks became common in professional studios, with recording tape reaching two and three inches (5.08&amp;nbsp;cm - 7.62&amp;nbsp;cm) wide.  The so-called "golden age" of large format professional analog recorders would last into the 1990s when the technology was mostly replaced with digital tape machines, and later on, computer systems using [[hard disk drive]]s instead of tape.  Some music producers and musicians still prefer working with the sound of vintage analog recording equipment despite the additional costs and difficulties involved.

Large format analog multitrack machines can have up to 24 tracks on a tape two inches wide which is the widest analog tape that is generally available. Prototype machines, by [[Music Center Incorporated|MCI]] in 1978, using 3" tape for 32 tracks never went into production, though [[Otari Incorporated|Otari]] made a 32 track 2" MX-80.  A few studios still operate large format analog recorders, though much of the time their use is only to copy sounds onto a modern digital format.  Maintaining these machines has become increasingly difficult as new parts are rarely available.  New tape is still available but prices have risen significantly in recent years.

[[File:TEAC 2340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 2340, a popular early (1973) home multitrack recorder, four tracks on ¼ inch tape.]]

==Home systems==

In 1972 [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] marketed their consumer 4-channel [[quadraphonic]] tape recorders for use as home multitrack recorders.  The result were the popular TEAC 2340 and 3340 models.  Both used ¼ inch tape.  The 2340 ran at either 3¾ or 7½ inches per second and used 7-inch reels while the 3340 ran at 7½ or 15&amp;nbsp;inches per second and used 10½ inch reels.  The 2340 was priced at under U.S. $1,000 making it very popular for home use.

The advent of the [[compact audio cassette]] (developed in 1963) ultimately led to affordable, portable four-track machines such as the [[Tascam]] [[Portastudio]] which debuted in 1979. Cassette-based machines could not provide the same audio quality as [[reel-to-reel]] machines, but served as a useful tool for professional and semi-pro musicians in making [[demo (music)|song demos]]. The Portastudio had a revolutionary effect on the emerging [[punk rock]] genre, because it enabled young bands to make recordings without signing to a [[record label]]. In the early years of punk, many bands self-produced their own recordings and sold them at gigs and by putting advertisements in underground [[zine]]s. [[Bruce Springsteen|Bruce Springsteen's]] 1982 album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' was made this way, with Springsteen choosing the album's earlier demo versions over the later studio recordings.

The familiar tape cassette was designed to accommodate four channels of audio – in a commercially recorded cassette these four tracks would normally constitute the stereo channels (each consisting of two tracks) for both 'sides' of the cassette – in a four-track cassette recorder all four tracks of a cassette are utilized together, often with the tape running at twice the normal speed (3¾ instead of 1⅞ inches per second) for increased fidelity. A separate signal can be recorded on to each of four tracks. (As such, the four-track machine does not utilize the two separate sides of the cassette in the conventional sense; if the cassette is inserted the other way round, all four tracks play in reverse.) As with professional machines, two or more tracks can be bounced down to one. When recording is complete, the volume level of each track is optimized, [[effect unit|electronic effects]] such as [[reverb]] are added to certain tracks where desired, each track is separately 'panned' to the desired point in the stereo field and the resulting stereo signal is mixed down to a separate stereo machine (such as a conventional cassette recorder).

[[File:Alesis-HD24.jpg|thumb|300px|The Alesis HD24 stand-alone multitrack hard disk recorder.]]

==Digital multitracking==

By the early 1970s, Thomas Stockham of Sound Stream Digital, created the first practical use of [[pulse code modulation]], also called PCM [[digital recording]], for [[high fidelity]] purposes. The first to be released were rereleased cleaned up versions of acoustic recordings made by the great tenor, [[Enrico Caruso]]. Early computer algorithms were used in the process of cleaning up the scratchy old 78 RPM records. The process could not be done in "real time" as the early computers were not very powerful or fast, compared to 2010-era computers. All of the data had to be stored on linear digital tape and then played back, in real time. The actual ingest from the 78 RPM records to the digital tape was also done in real-time. The computer processing to clean up the surface noise, pops and scratches took the early computers quite some time to process.

By the late 1970s, [[3M]] introduced the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits could not be accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing &amp; mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital "word". The only converters of the day were 12 bit &amp; 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit "word" for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50&amp;nbsp;kHz). It was known to be the best sounding{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=April 2018}} of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz for CD's &amp; 48&amp;nbsp;kHz for digital video.

The accepted world standard was created by [[Sony]] along with Philips. Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently and it could be edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and splicing tape. The Sony used 1/2 inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the "DASH" format meaning, " Digital Audio Stationary Head". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the [[dynamic range]] and [[signal to noise ratio]]s.

Starting in 1992, the ALESIS Corporation, a company which made digital [[drum machine]]s and inexpensive analog [[audio mixer]]s introduced the first multitrack, eight track, project studio, digital 8 track machine. It was named the ADAT, after the earlier 2 track digital recorders of the time known as DAT (Digital Audio Tape), which were based upon a small spinning head, similar to a consumer video recorder. The ADAT machine recorded its data in an already well-established consumer format based on VHS videotape recorder technology. Eight separate data tracks were recorded within the same bandwidth it took to record a TV show on a home video recorder (VHS). Numerous machines could be electronically locked together with a single cable. You could plug in enough 8 track machines together to create one giant 128 track machine. And like the professional studio recorders before it, a large full function [[remote control]] was also available.

The following year, the TEAC/TASCAM Corporation, introduced their DA-88. Those used the smaller 8&amp;nbsp;mm video format tapes. Those recorded four duplexed pairs of data tracks and would require a "read before write" function for [[overdubbing]] purposes of adjacent tracks. A full size remote and remote metering was also made available. Later units introduced by both companies provided for higher bit depths such as 20 &amp; 24 bit. These machines like the early home studio TEAC's before them, slashed the prices of professional digital multitrack recording. It changed the recording industry forever.
[[File:Korg D888.jpg|right|thumb|Korg D888 eight-track digital recorder]]
By the late 1990s, dedicated multitrack recorders faded with the introduction of the [[classic Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]] and [[Windows operating system]]s in personal computers. Some of the first companies jumping on board with this technology were New England Digital and Digidesign, from the US &amp; Fairlight, from Australia. Through the 1990s, multitrack recorders became digital, using a variety of technologies and media types. These including digital tape format (such as [[ADAT]]), or in some cases [[Minidisc]]s.

Some of the leading providers of multitrackers were [[Tascam]] (hard drive or cassette based), [[Alesis]] (ADAT digital tape based), [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]/[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] (hard drive based), [[Fostex]] (hard drive based), [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] (hard drive based), and [[Korg]].

A highly competitive market and rapidly falling costs for this equipment has made it common to find multitrack recording technology outside a typical recording studio.

== Computer-based recording ==

The first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called Deck, was released in 1990. The core engine technology and much of the user interface was programmed and designed by Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton from a small San Francisco based company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/osc.html Wired article on Digidesign/OSC history]&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the platform upon which [[Pro Tools]] was built in 1991. The same technology lay behind the 1992 release of [[Cubase]] Audio, the first version to offer audio support in addition to [[MIDI]] sequencing capabilities.

While hardware costs have fallen the power of the personal computer have increased, so that in the 2010s, a good quality home computer is sufficiently powerful to serve as a complete multitrack recorder, if a band or performer has a USB microphone or a regular microphone and a [[sound card]] adapter, using inexpensive hardware and software. Since 2012, the multitracking software [[GarageBand]] is offered as a free download for all of [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] new computers or $4.99 for older models.  GarageBand added to the many free or under $100 solutions available to the Windows platform that run on less expensive but often more powerful hardware.  In a price range between $150 and usually under $1000, superior software mimicking complex recording studios that once could cost a hundred thousand dollars, or more, are also available  However solutions this powerful are not needed for most applications.  This is a far cry from the days when multitrack recorders cost thousands of dollars and few people could afford them.  In early (circa) 2000 the availability of low cost CakeWalk for windows provided opportunities for many to get a start in multi-track digital recording on the Windows for around $50 to $100.  After hardware became more powerful, more capabilities became available, including more digital channels and plug in effects.

In the 2010s, the availability of inexpensive software coupled with low cost hardware solutions, have enabled many [[singer-songwriter]]s to self-produce their first recordings without paying high fees for a professional recording studio or audio engineer. The most popular DAW today are: Pro Tools, Reaper, Live, Cubase, Logic and Digital Performer.

==History==
ip.access was founded in December 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ttp.com/corporate/about/ |title= About TTP |publisher= TTP Group |accessdate= June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of TTP Group PLC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttpgroup.com/about/TTP TTP Group PLC]&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at developing technologies that would allow multiple radio access technologies to communicate over the Internet. To accommodate its growing staff, in 2006 ip.access relocated to new offices in Cambourne Business Park, Cambridge, where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |url=http://www.ipaccess.com/content/news/press.php?id=20 |title=ip.access Moves to New Offices to Support Growth |publisher= ip.access| accessdate= June 3, 2011 | date=September 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, TTP Group spun off its communications division (TTP Communications, or TTPCom) in an [[initial public offering]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]], and ip.access joined the spin-off as a wholly owned subsidiary of the TTPCom group.

In March 2006, the company secured an £8.5 million round of funding from [[Intel Capital]], Scottish Equity Partners, and [[Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |url= http://www.ipaccess.com/content/news/press.php?id=27 |title=ip.access Secures £8.5 million Funding to Accelerate Growth in Cost-Effective Cellular Infrastructure for Homes and Businesses |publisher= ip.access| accessdate= June 3, 2011 | date=March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its June 2006 acquisition of TTP Communications, [[Motorola]] also gained a stake in ip.access.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/07/motorola_buys_ttpcom/ Motorola gobbles up TTPcom], ''The Register'', June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, after signing an OEM agreement with ip.access, [[ADC Telecommunications|ADC]]&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Ken.

'''Malaria vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] that is used to prevent [[malaria]]. The only approved vaccine as of 2015 is RTS,S. It requires four injections, and has a relatively low [[vaccine efficacy|efficacy]]. Due to this low efficacy, [[WHO]] does not recommend the use of RTS,S vaccine in babies between 6 and 12 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=WHO2016&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malaria vaccine: WHO position paper – January 2016|journal=Weekly epidemiological record|date=Nov 4, 2016|volume=91|issue=4|pages=33–52|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9104.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vaccine is going to be studied further in Africa in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghana, Kenya and Malawi to take part in WHO malaria vaccine pilot programme|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/pressreleases/item/9533-ghana-kenya-and-malawi-to-take-part-in-who-malaria-vaccine-pilot-programme.html|accessdate=27 April 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research continues into recombinant protein and attenuated whole organism vaccines.

==Approved vaccines==

===RTS,S===
{{Main|RTS,S}}
RTS,S (developed by [[PATH (global health organization)#Malaria|PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI)]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) with support from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]) is the most recently developed [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] vaccine. It consists of the ''P. falciparum'' [[circumsporozoite protein]] (CSP) from the pre-erythrocytic stage. The CSP antigen causes the production of antibodies capable of preventing the invasion of [[hepatocytes]] and additionally elicits a cellular response enabling the destruction of infected hepatocytes. The CSP vaccine presented problems in trials due to its poor [[immunogenicity]]. RTS,S attempted to avoid these by fusing the protein with a surface antigen from [[hepatitis B]], hence creating a more potent and immunogenic vaccine. When tested in trials an emulsion of oil in water and the added adjuvants of [[monophosphoryl A]] and QS21 (SBAS2), the vaccine gave protective immunity to 7 out of 8 volunteers when challenged with ''P. falciparum.''&lt;ref name="Links to articles about recent RTS changes"&gt;{{cite web|title=RTS,S malaria candidate vaccine reduces malaria by approximately one-third in African infants|url=http://www.malariavaccine.org/rd-rtss.php|work=malariavaccine.org|publisher=Malaria Vaccine Initiative Path|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTS,S/AS01 (commercial name Mosquirix),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.co.uk/FinanceNews.asp?ArticleCode=zomftb67bm5garg&amp;ArticleHeadline=GSK_malaria_vaccine_shows_longlasting_protection Commercial name of RTS,S]&lt;/ref&gt; was engineered using genes from the outer protein of ''P. falciparum'' malaria parasite and a portion of a hepatitis B virus plus a chemical [[adjuvant]] to boost the immune response. Infection is prevented by inducing high antibody titers that block the parasite from infecting the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1172/JCI70349 |title=Vaccine-induced monoclonal antibodies targeting circumsporozoite protein prevent Plasmodium falciparum infection |year=2014 |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=140–4 |pmid=24292709 |last1=Foquet |first1=Lander |last2=Hermsen |first2=Cornelus |last3=van Gemert |first3=Geert-Jan |last4=Van Braeckel |first4=Eva |last5=Weening |first5=Karin |last6=Sauerwein |first6=Robert |last7=Meuleman |first7=Philip |last8=Leroux-Roels |first8=Geert  |pmc=3871238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers are non-profit In November 2012 a Phase III trial of RTS,S found that it provided modest protection against both clinical and severe malaria in young infants.&lt;ref name="doi10.1056/NEJMoa1208394"/&gt;

{{As of|October 2013}} preliminary results of a phase III clinical trial indicated that RTS,S/AS01 reduced the number of cases among young children by almost 50 percent and among infants by around 25 percent. The study ended in 2014. The effects of a booster dose were positive, even though overall efficacy seem to wane with time. After four years reductions were 36 percent for children who received three shots and a booster dose. Missing the booster dose reduced the efficacy against severe malaria to a negligible effect. The vaccine was shown to be less effective for infants. Three doses of vaccine plus a booster reduced the risk of clinical episodes by 26 percent over three years, but offered no significant protection against severe malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/malaria-vaccine-candidate-trial/37205|title=Malaria vaccine candidate shown to prevent thousands of cases|last=Borghino|first=Dario|date=April 27, 2015|website=www.gizmag.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a bid to accommodate a larger group and guarantee a sustained availability for the general public, GSK applied for a marketing license with the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2014/gsk-announces-eu-regulatory-submission-for-malaria-vaccine-candidate-rtss//|title=GSK announces EU regulatory submission of malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S|author=Press Release|publisher=GSK|date=24 July 2014|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GSK treated the project as a non-profit initiative, with most funding coming from the Gates Foundation, a major contributor to malaria eradication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GSK aims to market world’s first malaria vaccine|author=Kelland, Kate|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/07/us-malaria-vaccine-gsk-idUSBRE9960Y320131007|newspaper=Reuters|date=7 October 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations==
The task of developing a preventive vaccine for malaria is a complex process. There are a number of considerations to be made concerning what strategy a potential vaccine should adopt.

===Parasite diversity===

''P. falciparum'' has demonstrated the capability, through the development of multiple drug-resistant parasites, for evolutionary change. The [[Plasmodium|''Plasmodium'' species]] has a very high rate of replication, much higher than that actually needed to ensure transmission in the parasite’s life cycle. This enables pharmaceutical treatments that are effective at reducing the reproduction rate, but not halting it, to exert a high selection pressure, thus favoring the development of resistance. The process of evolutionary change is one of the key considerations necessary when considering potential vaccine candidates. The development of resistance could cause a significant reduction in efficacy of any potential vaccine thus rendering useless a carefully developed and effective treatment. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Choosing to address the symptom or the source===

The parasite induces two main response types from the human immune system.  These are anti-parasitic immunity and anti-toxic immunity.

*"Anti-parasitic immunity" addresses the source; it consists of an antibody response ([[humoral immunity]]) and a cell-mediated immune response. Ideally a vaccine would enable the development of anti-plasmodial [[antibodies]] in addition to generating an elevated cell-mediated response.  Potential antigens against which a vaccine could be targeted will be discussed in greater depth later. Antibodies are part of the specific immune response. They exert their effect by activating the complement cascade, stimulating [[phagocytic cells]] into [[endocytosis]] through adhesion to an external surface of the antigenic substances, thus ‘marking’ it as offensive.  Humoral or cell-mediated immunity consists of many interlinking mechanisms that essentially aim to prevent infection entering the body (through external barriers or hostile internal environments) and then kill any micro-organisms or foreign particles that succeed in penetration. The cell-mediated component consists of many white blood cells (such as [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[macrophages]], [[lymphocytes]], [[basophils]], [[mast cells]], [[natural killer cells]], and [[eosinophils]]) that target foreign bodies by a variety of different mechanisms. In the case of malaria both systems would be targeted to attempt to increase the potential response generated, thus ensuring the maximum chance of preventing disease. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*"Anti-toxic immunity" addresses the symptoms; it refers to the suppression of the immune response associated with the production of factors that either induce symptoms or reduce the effect that any toxic by-products (of micro-organism presence) have on the development of disease. For example, it has been shown that [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] has a central role in generating the symptoms experienced in severe ''P. falciparum'' malaria. Thus a therapeutic vaccine could target the production of TNF-a, preventing respiratory distress and cerebral symptoms. This approach has serious limitations as it would not reduce the parasitic load; rather it only reduces the associated pathology.  As a result, there are substantial difficulties in evaluating efficacy in human trials.

Taking this information into consideration an ideal vaccine candidate would attempt to generate a more substantial cell-mediated and antibody response on parasite presentation. This would have the benefit of increasing the rate of parasite clearance, thus reducing the experienced symptoms and providing a level  of consistent future immunity against the parasite.

===Potential targets===

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Potential vaccine targets in the [[Plasmodium#Life_cycle|malaria lifecycle]] (Doolan and Hoffman)

|}

By their very nature, protozoa are more complex organisms than bacteria and viruses, with more complicated structures and life cycles. This presents problems in vaccine development but also increases the number of potential targets for a vaccine. These have been summarised into the life cycle stage and the antibodies that could potentially elicit an immune response.

The epidemiology of malaria varies enormously across the globe, and has led to the belief that it may be necessary to adopt very different vaccine development strategies to target the different populations. A Type 1 vaccine is suggested for those exposed mostly to ''P. falciparum'' malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, with the primary objective to reduce the number of severe malaria cases and deaths in infants and children exposed to high transmission rates. The Type 2 vaccine could be thought of as a ‘travellers’ vaccine’, aiming to prevent all cases of clinical symptoms in individuals with no previous exposure. This is another major public health problem, with malaria presenting as one of the most substantial threats to travellers’ health. Problems with the current available pharmaceutical therapies include costs, availability, adverse effects and contraindications, inconvenience and compliance, many of which would be reduced or eliminated entirely if an effective (greater than 85–90%) vaccine was developed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The life cycle of the malaria parasite is particularly complex, presenting initial developmental problems. Despite the huge number of vaccines available at the current time, there are none that target parasitic infections. The distinct developmental stages involved in the life cycle present numerous opportunities for targeting antigens, thus potentially eliciting an immune response.  Theoretically, each developmental stage could have a vaccine developed specifically to target the parasite. Moreover, any vaccine produced would ideally have the ability to be of therapeutic value as well as preventing further transmission and is likely to consist of a combination of antigens from different phases of the parasite’s development.  More than 30 of these antigens are currently being researched by teams all over the world in the hope of identifying a combination that can elicit immunity in the inoculated individual. Some of the approaches involve surface expression of the antigen, inhibitory effects of specific antibodies on the life cycle and the protective effects through immunization or passive transfer of antibodies between an immune and a non-immune host. The majority of research into malarial vaccines has focused on the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' strain due to the high mortality caused by the parasite and the ease of a carrying out in vitro/in vivo studies. The earliest vaccines attempted to use the parasitic [[circumsporozoite]] (CS) protein. This is the most dominant surface antigen of the initial pre-erythrocytic phase. However, problems were encountered due to low efficacy, [[reactogenicity]] and low [[immunogenicity]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

*The initial stage in the life cycle, following inoculation, is a relatively short "pre-erythrocytic" or "hepatic" phase. A vaccine at this stage must have the ability to protect against sporozoites invading and possibly inhibiting the development of parasites in the hepatocytes (through inducing [[cytotoxic]] [[T-lymphocytes]] that can destroy the infected [[liver cells]]). However, if any sporozoites evaded the immune system they would then have the potential to be symptomatic and cause the clinical disease.
*The second phase of the life cycle is the "erythrocytic" or blood phase. A vaccine here could prevent [[merozoite]] multiplication or the invasion of [[red blood cells]]. This approach is complicated by the lack of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC molecule]] expression on the surface of erythrocytes. Instead, malarial antigens are expressed, and it is this towards which the antibodies could potentially be directed. Another approach would be to attempt to block the process of erythrocyte adherence to blood vessel walls. It is thought that this process is accountable for much of the clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection; therefore a vaccine given during this stage would be therapeutic and hence administered during clinical episodes to prevent further deterioration. 
*The last phase of the life cycle that has the potential to be targeted by a vaccine is the "sexual stage". This would not give any protective benefits to the individual inoculated but would prevent further transmission of the parasite by preventing the [[gametocytes]] from producing multiple sporozoites in the gut wall of the mosquito. It therefore would be used as part of a policy directed at eliminating the parasite from areas of low prevalence or to prevent the development and spread of vaccine-resistant parasites. This type of transmission-blocking vaccine is potentially very important. The evolution of resistance in the malaria parasite occurs very quickly, potentially making any vaccine redundant within a few generations. This approach to the prevention of spread is therefore essential.
*Another approach is to target the [[protein kinases]], which are present during the entire lifecyle of the malaria parasite. Research is underway on this, yet production of an actual vaccine targeting these protein kinases may still take a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang VM, Chavchich M, Waters NC |title=Targeting protein kinases in the malaria parasite: update of an antimalarial drug target |journal=Curr Top Med Chem  |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=456–72 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22242850 |doi= 10.2174/156802612799362922|url=http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CTMC/2012/00000012/00000005/0006R.SGM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' is the common malaria species found in India, Southeast Asia and South America.   It is able to stay dormant in the [[liver]] and reemerge years later to elicit new infections.  Two key proteins involved in the invasion of the red blood cells (RBC) by ''P. vivax'' are potential targets for drug or vaccine development.  When the Duffy binding protein (DBP) of ''P. vivax'' binds the Duffy antigen (DARC) on the surface of RBC, process for the parasite to enter the RBC is initiated.  Structures of the core region of DARC and the receptor binding pocket of DBP have been mapped by scientists at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]].  The researchers found that the binding is a two-step process which involves two copies of the parasite protein act together like a pair of tong and 'clamp'’ two copies of DARC.    Antibodies that interfere with the binding, by either targeting the key region of the DARC or the DBP will prevent the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/protein-discovery-could-aid-malaria-vaccine-design/2014-01-13|title=Scientists capture key protein structures that could aid malaria vaccine design|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batchelor|first1=J.|last2=Malpede|first2=B.|last3=Omattage|first3=N.|last4=DeKoster|first4=G.|last5=Henzler-Wildman|first5=K.|last6=Tolia|first6=N.|title=Red Blood Cell Invasion by ''Plasmodium vivax'': Structural Basis for DBP Engagement of DARC|journal=[[PLOS Pathogens]]|volume=10|issue=1|page= e1003869|year=2014|publisher=[[PLOS]]|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003869|url= http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1003869}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Antibodies against the [[Schizont]] Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1) were found to disable the parasite ability to rupture from the infected red blood cells (RBCs) thus prevent it from continuing with its life cycle.  Researchers from [[Rhode Island Hospital]] identified ''Plasmodium falciparum'' PfSEA-1, a 244 kd malaria antigen expressed in the schizont-infected RBCs.  Mice vaccinated with the recombinant PfSEA-1 produced antibodies which interrupted the schizont rupture from the RBCs and decreased the parasite replication.  The vaccine protected the mice from lethal challenge of the parasite.  Tanzanian and Kenyan children who have antibodies to PfSEA-1 were found to have fewer parasites in their blood stream and milder case of malaria.  By blocking the schizont outlet, the PfSEA-1 vaccine may work synergistically with vaccines targeting the other stages of the malaria life cycle such as [[hepatocyte]] and RBC invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/antigen-discovery-could-advance-malaria-vaccine/2014-05-27|title=Antigen Discovery could advance malaria vaccine|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|displayauthors=2|last1=Raj|first1=D|last2=Kurtis|first2=J|last3=Nixon|first3=C|title=Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection|journal=Science|volume=344|issue=6186|pages=871–877|year=2014|publisher=AAAS|doi= 10.1126/science.1254417|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6186/871|pmid=24855263|pmc=4184151|bibcode=2014Sci...344..871R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mix of antigenic components===

Increasing the potential immunity generated against ''Plasmodia'' can be achieved by attempting to target multiple phases in the life cycle. This is additionally beneficial in reducing the possibility of resistant parasites developing. The use of multiple-parasite antigens can therefore have a synergistic or additive effect.

One of the most successful vaccine candidates currently in clinical trials{{which|date=April 2017}} consists of recombinant antigenic proteins to the circumsporozoite protein.&lt;ref name="pmid19633296"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Plassmeyer ML, Reiter K, Shimp RL, etal |title=Structure of the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' Circumsporozoite Protein, a Leading Malaria Vaccine Candidate |journal=J.

===Delivery system===

The selection of an appropriate system is fundamental in all vaccine development, but especially so in the case of malaria. A vaccine targeting several antigens may require delivery to different areas and by different means in order to elicit an effective response. Some [[adjuvants]] can direct the vaccine to the specifically targeted cell type—e.g. the use of [[Hepatitis B virus]] in the [[RTS,S]] vaccine to target infected hepatocytes—but in other cases, particularly when using combined antigenic vaccines, this approach is very complex. Some methods that have been attempted include the use of two vaccines, one directed at generating a blood response and the other a liver-stage response. These two vaccines could then be injected into two different sites, thus enabling the use of a more specific and potentially efficacious delivery system.

To increase, accelerate or modify the development of an immune response to a vaccine candidate it is often necessary to combine the antigenic substance to be delivered with an adjuvant or specialised delivery system. These terms are often used interchangeably in relation to vaccine development; however in most cases a distinction can be made. An adjuvant is typically thought of as a substance used in combination with the antigen to produce a more substantial and robust immune response than that elicited by the antigen alone. This is achieved through three mechanisms: by affecting the antigen delivery and presentation, by inducing the production of immunomodulatory cytokines, and by affecting the [[antigen presenting cells]] (APC). Adjuvants can consist of many different materials, from cell microparticles to other particulated delivery systems (e.g. [[liposome]]s).

Adjuvants are crucial in affecting the specificity and isotype of the necessary antibodies. They are thought to be able to potentiate the link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Due to the diverse nature of substances that can potentially have this effect on the immune system, it is difficult to classify adjuvants into specific groups. In most circumstances they consist of easily identifiable components of micro-organisms that are recognised by the innate immune system cells. The role of delivery systems is primarily to direct the chosen adjuvant and antigen into target cells to attempt to increase the efficacy of the vaccine further, therefore acting synergistically with the adjuvant.

There is increasing concern that the use of very potent adjuvants could precipitate autoimmune responses, making it imperative that the vaccine is focused on the target cells only. Specific delivery systems can reduce this risk by limiting the potential toxicity and systemic distribution of newly developed adjuvants.

Studies into the efficacy of malaria vaccines developed to date have illustrated that the presence of an adjuvant is key in determining any protection gained against malaria. A large number of natural and synthetic adjuvants have been identified throughout the history of vaccine development. Options identified thus far for use combined with a malaria vaccine include mycobacterial cell walls, liposomes, monophosphoryl lipid A and squalene.

==Agents under development==
A completely effective vaccine is not yet available for malaria, although several vaccines are under development. SPf66 a synthetic peptide based vaccine developed by [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo]] team in [[Colombia]] was tested extensively in endemic areas in the 1990s, but clinical trials showed it to be insufficiently effective, 28% efficacy in South America and minimal or no efficacy in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16625647 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (SPf66) |issue=2 |pages=CD005966 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005966 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have also been insufficient on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17054281 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (blood-stage) |issue=4 |pages=CD006199 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006199 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several potential vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage are being developed, with [[RTS,S]] showing the most promising results so far.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17054280 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (pre-erythrocytic) |issue=4 |pages=CD006198 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006198 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1056/NEJMoa1208394"&gt;{{cite journal | author1= RTS&amp;#x2c;S Clinical Trials Partnership | last2= Agnandji | first2= S.

* The CSP (Circum-Sporozoite Protein) was a vaccine developed that initially appeared promising enough to undergo trials. It is also based on the circumsporozoite protein, but additionally has the recombinant (Asn-Ala-Pro15Asn-Val-Asp-Pro)2-Leu-Arg([[R32LR]]) protein covalently bound to a purified ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' toxin (A9). However at an early stage a complete lack of protective immunity was demonstrated in those inoculated. The study group used in [[Kenya]] had an 82% incidence of [[parasitaemia]] whilst the control group only had an 89% incidence. The vaccine intended to cause an increased T-lymphocyte response in those exposed, this was also not observed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* The [[NYVAC-Pf7]] multi-stage vaccine attempted to use different technology, incorporating seven ''P.falciparum'' antigenic genes. These came from a variety of stages during the life cycle. CSP and sporozoite surface protein 2 (called [[PfSSP2]]) were derived from the sporozoite phase. The liver stage antigen 1 (LSA1), three from the erythrocytic stage (merozoite surface protein 1, serine repeat antigen and AMA-1) and one sexual stage antigen (the 25-kDa Pfs25) were included. This was first investigated using [[Rhesus monkeys]] and produced encouraging results: 4 out of the 7 antigens produced specific antibody responses (CSP, PfSSP2, [[Merozoite surface protein|MSP1]] and PFs25). Later trials in humans, despite demonstrating cellular immune responses in over 90% of the subjects had very poor antibody responses. Despite this following administration of the vaccine some candidates had complete protection when challenged with ''P.falciparum''. This result has warranted ongoing trials. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* In 1995 a field trial involving [NANP]19-5.1 proved to be very successful. Out of 194 children vaccinated none developed symptomatic malaria in the 12-week follow up period and only 8 failed to have higher levels of antibody present. The vaccine consists of the [[schizont export protein]] (5.1) and 19 repeats of the sporozoite surface protein [NANP]. Limitations of the technology exist as it contains only 20% [[peptide]] and has low levels of immunogenicity. It also does not contain any immunodominant T-cell [[epitopes]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Individuals who are exposed to the parasite in endemic countries develop acquired immunity against disease and death. Such immunity does not however prevent malarial infection; immune individuals often harbour asymptomatic parasites in their blood.  This does, however, imply that it is possible to create an immune response that protects against the harmful effects of the parasite.

Research shows that if [[immunoglobulin]] is taken from immune adults, purified and then given to individuals who have no protective immunity, some protection can be gained.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

'''MessagEase''' is an [[input method]] and [[virtual keyboard]] for touchscreen devices. It relies on a new entry system designed by Saied B. Nesbat, formatted as a 3x3 matrix keypad where users may press or swipe up, down, left, right, or diagonally to access all keys and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bozorgui-Nesbat|first1=Saied|title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces - ICMI 2003|date=2003|publisher=ACM Press|location=Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|isbn=1-58113-621-8|pages=4–11|chapter=A system for fast, full-text entry for small electronic devices}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a keyboard that was designed for devices like cell phones, mimicking the early cell phones' limited number of 12 keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khalil Ibrahim|first1=Ismail|title=Handbook of Research on Mobile Multimedia|date=30 September 2008|publisher=Information Science Reference|isbn=978-1605660462|page=777|edition=Second }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common letters (the large letters in the illustration below) are accessed by a tap. Less common letters are accessed by a slide. Example: Tapping the center square generates an 'o'. Sliding to the left from the same square generates a 'c'. A green trail shows the path of the finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four funky Android keyboards|URL=http://www.cnet.com/news/four-funky-android-keyboards/|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard supports multiple user dictionaries, used for word prediction and correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Android FAQ|URL=http://www.exideas.com/ME/android_faq.html|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software is developed and patented by ExIdeas, based in [[Belmont, California]]. It was first released in 2002 for the Palm, along with a paper in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lomas|title=As Mobile Devices Morph Into Wearables, Keyboard Maker MessagEase Wants Your Fingers To Settle On Its Qwerty Killer|accessdate=19 March 2015|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
[[File:MessagEase.png|thumb|right|300px|Default keyboard]]
The [[keyboard layout]] has a 3x3 matrix that allows for full-text entry. The letter placement is optimized for minimal movement distance between letters, allowing for faster typing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bozorgui-Nesbat|first1=Saied|title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces - ICMI 2003|date=2003|publisher=ACM Press|location=Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|isbn=1-58113-621-8|pages=4–11|chapter=A system for fast, full-text entry for small electronic devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout is 67% faster than a standard QWERTY software keyboard, and 31% faster than a [[multi-tap]] keyboard, when typing is modeled with [[Fitt's law]].

===One touch keys===
The 9 most [[Letter frequency|frequent letters]] in English texts: ETAONRISH, are placed on the keyboard so they can be accessed on a single click.

===One move keys===
The next 17 less frequent letters: DLFCMUGYPWBVKJXQZ, are placed as to be triggered by a single move of the finger from or to the central key (O) (except for Z which is centered around the 'E' key together with some punctuation characters). For example, the letter V is typed by dragging the finger from A to O, and the letter D by moving from O to E.

===Special characters===
The moves producing special characters, which includes 38 characters including accents and punctuation marks, are displayed on a complete keyboard showing up when the user drags the space bar upwards.

This is not an alternate keyboard in the sense that the key pair moves are valid on both keyboard. It is rather a mnemonic help, which is normally hidden to avoid overwhelming the user with spurious information.

===Control keys===
A small vertical bar on the right gives direct access to the cut/copy/paste operations, the numeric keypad, the uppercase/lowercase control, as well the usual F1-F12 control keys. This is also commanded by moving the finger from one cell to an other.

===Semantic sugar===
A set of small movements makes the life of the typist easier, like drawing a small circle or a back and forth movement to write a letter uppercase, or prolonging the movement to put accent on letters.

The keyboard can be resized to fit the need of the user, and is also provided in a double sized version with the numeric keypad on the side of the alphabetic keypad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alkhalifa|first1=Eshaa|title=Cognitively Informed Intelligent Interfaces: Systems Design and Development|date=31 May 2012|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1466616288|page=30|edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Software==
The keyboard is currently available for Android devices, iOS devices and the Apple Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.exideas.com/ME/index.php|title=MessageEase|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MessagEase was released in 2002 for the Palm. It was also originally a competitor to the [[T9 (predictive text)|T9]] predictive input method, on a 12-button phone, with 9 number buttons. In this first iteration, each of the 9 primary characters needed to be pressed twice in a row, and secondary characters were entered by first pressing the main button, and then pressing one of the remaining 8 buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Paternò|editor1-first=Fabio|title=Mobile Human-Computer Interaction - 4th International Symposium - Mobile HCI 2002|date=2002|publisher=Springer|location=Pisa, Italy|isbn=3-540-44189-1|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this first iteration, because many letters required two presses, it was not significantly faster than the [[Multi-tap]] input method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chi Connect 2004: Conference Proceedings: Conference On Human Factors In Computing Systems|date=April 2004|publisher=ACM Press|location=Vienna, Austria|isbn=978-1581137026|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MessagEase is now exclusively for touch screens, and no longer has physical 12-button support. All characters are now entered by tapping or swiping.

'''Mobile Telecommunication Company of Esfahan''' (شرکت مخابرات سیار اصفهان, '''MTCE''') also known as '''Espadan''' was a [[mobile network operator]] in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=8511728|title=Mobile Telecommunications Company of Esfahan: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ihs.com/country-industry-forecasting.html?ID=106599432|title=Iran to License Third Nationwide Cellular Operator|website=www.ihs.com|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the agreements reached during the Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani's visit to Malaysia in 1994, and according to the laws of attracting and supporting foreign investment, in 29 May 2001 the license for launching the first [[Prepay mobile phone|prepaid mobile telephone]] network in Iran with an initial capacity of 20 thousand subscribers was granted to [[Celcom]] for 15 years, and the Malaysian Technology Resources Industry Company received permission to use [[GSM]] 24.18 Mbit/s bandwidth within the [[Isfahan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mtce.ir/contactus/about-us.dot|title=درباره ما - MTCE|date=2016-04-02|access-date=2017-11-25|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402164244/http://mtce.ir/contactus/about-us.dot|archivedate=2016-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past [[computers]] needed to be disconnected from their internal network if they needed to be taken or moved anywhere. ''Mobile architecture'' allows maintaining this connection whilst during transit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bukhres97proposed.html  A Proposed Mobile Architecture for Distributed Database Environment] (1997)  O. Bukhres, S. Morton, P. Zhang, E. Vanderdijs, C. Crawley&lt;/ref&gt; Each day the number of mobile devices is increasing, mobile architecture is the pieces of technology needed to create a rich, connected user experience. 
Currently there is a lack of uniform interoperability plans and implementation. There is a lack of common industry view on architectural framework. This increases costs and slows down 3rd party mobile development. An open approach is required across all industries to achieve same end results and services.

==Important components of a mobile architecture==
*'''Scalability''' – A Mobile Architecture must be able to be utilized with all recovery requirements on both large and small scale.
*'''Secure''' – Encryption is important, transmission protocols must support encryption ([[Transport Layer Security|SSL]]) via secure transit such as [[HTTPS]]
*'''Reliable''' – Reliability is always important in all technologies and mobile architecture is no different.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The basic and detail architecture of the Mobile device consists of Hardware and Software architecture. The main hardware components
of the mobile phone is the application processor that controls all other components of the device such as display, keypad, power, audio , video etc. The radio signals are handled by base band
processor which in turn communicates with other processors to use their functionality. Power and audio processor controls the functioning of speaker and microphone with the help of application
processor. Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) contains the details about the subscriber.

==Best practices==
* Data should be populated for database views
* Use version numbers to track updates during synchronization
* Maintain only necessary user details in middle ware
* The application should recognize when CPU battery is low and adjust background running to low to extend battery power
* UI on multiple screens should have common elements&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb985493  Best Practices: Extending Enterprise Applications to Mobile Devices] (1997)  The Architecture Journal : Journal 14 Kulathumani Hariharan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
A consortium of companies are pushing for products and services to be based on open, global standards, protocols and interfaces and are not locked to proprietary technologies. The applications layer to be bearer agnostic (examples: GSM, GPRS, EDGE, CDMA, UMTS). The architecture framework and service enablers will be independent of operating systems. There will be support for inseparability of applications and platforms, seamless geographic and inter-generational roaming.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Mobile search''' is an evolving branch of information retrieval services that is centered on the [[convergence (telecommunications)|convergence]] of [[mobile operating system|mobile platforms]] and [[mobile phone]]s, or that it can be used to tell information about something and other [[mobile device]]s. [[Web search engine]] ability in a mobile form allows users to find mobile content on [[website]]s which are available to mobile devices on mobile networks. As this happens mobile content shows a media shift toward mobile multimedia. Simply put, mobile search is not just a spatial shift of PC web search to mobile equipment, but is witnessing more of treelike branching into specialized segments of mobile broadband and mobile content, both of which show a fast-paced evolution.

== Market description ==

"Competition for the US mobile search market promises to be fierce, thanks to the large US online ad market and strong pushes by portals. By 2019, mobile ad spending will rise to $65.87 billion, or 72.2% of total digital ad spend", according to a leading market research firm; [[eMarketer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Will-Account-72-of-US-Digital-Ad-Spend-by-2019/1012258|title=Mobile Will Account for 72% of US Digital Ad Spend by 2019|work=[[eMarketer.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on a researcher's particular bias toward telecom, Web or technology factors, the published forecasts for global mobile search vary from $1.5 billion by 2011 (from Informa Telecoms &amp; Media) to over $11 billion by 2008 (according to [[Piper Jaffray]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1005083|work=[[eMarketer.com]]|title=The Search Wars Are Going Mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile search is important for the usability of [[mobile content]] for the same reasons as internet search engines became important to the usability of internet content. Early internet content was largely provided by portals such as [[Netscape]]. As the depth of available content grew, portals were unable to provide total coverage. As a result, [[Internet]] [[web search engine]]s such as [[Google]] and [[AltaVista]] proved popular as a way of allowing users to find the increasingly specialist content they were looking for. In an international journal article, 'Exploring the logic of mobile search', Westlund, Gómez-Barroso, Compañó, and Feijóo(2011) outline a thorough review of research on mobile search usage, and also present an in-depth study of user patterns. They conclude that mobile search has started to change mobile [[media consumption]] patterns radically. They also emphasize that future developments of mobile search must be sensitive to the mobile logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Westlund|first=Oscar|last2=Gómez-Barroso|first2=José-Luis|last3=Compañó|first3=Ramón|last4=Feijóo|first4=Claudio|year=2011|title=Exploring the logic of mobile search|work=Behaviour &amp; Information Technology|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a927256739~frm=abslink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Within the broad umbrella of mobile search (the ability to browse for mobile specific content), there are a range of services. Given the relative immaturity of the market, not all of these can be expected to become the industry standards.

===Mobile optimized search engines===
Most major search engines have implemented a mobile optimized version of their products that take into consideration bandwidth and form factor limitations of the mobile platform.  For example, Google has launched a mobile-friendly version of their search engine. The algorithms for mobile search engine results are thought to be evolving and aspects such as location and predictive searching will become increasingly important. [[Google]] just released its latest 160 page Full Search Quality Raters Guide&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//insidesearch/howsearchworks/assets/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf "Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines" ''How Search Works'' November 12, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; with a new emphasis on Mobile and Usefulness.

===Mobile question and answer services===
These services allow a user to text a question to a central database and receive a reply using text. A usage example would be a user that wants to know the answer to a very specific question but is not in front of his/her computer. Most mobile 'Q&amp;A' services are powered by human researchers and are therefore a type of [[organic search engine]]. A new approach by [[AskMeNow]] and MobileBits is to use [[Semantic Web]] technology to automate the process.

===Mobile directory search===
This service is known by different names dependent on country and operator. It can also be known as 'Find My Nearest' or 'Mobile Yellow Pages' services. The basics of the services allow users to find local services in the vicinity of their current location. The services often use [[location-based service|location-based]] technology to pinpoint exactly where the user currently is. An example of usage would be a user looking for a local cab or taxi company after a night out. Services also usually come with a map and directions to help the user. An example is the service offered by [[Yell Group|Yell]] in the UK which is powered by MobilePeople's technology.

===Mobile discovery services===
These services offer users recommendations on what they should do next. An example would be recommending a user a similar ringtone to the one that s/he has just browsed for. They operate, in a mobile context, in a similar way to the recommendation engines provided by internet retail shops such as [[Amazon.com]]. An example of real usage is the Directory Enquiries (DQ) service operated by Orange in the UK. Callers to the Orange landline DQ service are given the business and residential numbers they have requested verbally by an operator. In addition, Orange sends the information in text format to the users mobile phone. The information contains a text reminder of the requested information as well as links to local businesses, services and other interesting information in the local area that the user has searched on.

===Mobile navigation services===
These services provide the indexing structure to the portals provided by [[mobile network operator|mobile operators]]. They index the content already on the operators' portal but also provide users access to mobile specific content that is available outside the confines of the portal.

===Dynamic mobile selection interface services===
A new category of mobile search tool that is emerging is one in which a pre-selected set of possible search content is downloaded in advance by a mobile user and then allows for a final internet search step.  An example of such search tools is the Worldport Navigator for the iPhone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldport.net|title=Worldport Navigator for the iPhone}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides users with a push-button experience of selecting from thousands of human-screened and categorized Web selections in three or four seconds, without the need for text entry, search, result review, or page-scrolling.

'''People Finder Interchange Format''' ('''PFIF''') is a widely used open data standard for information about missing or displaced people. PFIF was designed to enable information sharing among governments, relief organizations, and other survivor registries to help people find and contact their family and friends after a disaster.

== Overview ==
PFIF is extended from [[XML]]. It consists of person records, which contain identifying information about a person, and note records, which contain comments and updates on the status and location of a person. Each note is attached to one person. PFIF defines the set of fields in these records and an XML-based format to store or transfer them. PFIF XML records can be embedded in [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feeds or [[RSS]] feeds.

PFIF allows different repositories of missing person data to exchange and aggregate their records. Every record has a unique identifier, which indicates the domain name of the original repository where the record was created. The unique record identifier is preserved as the record is copied from one repository to another. For example, any repository that receives a copy of a given person can publish a note attached to that person, and even as the note and person are copied to other repositories, they remain traceable to their respective original sources.

== History ==
Within three days after the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]], people were using over 25 different online forums and survivor registries to report and check on their family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the first and largest of these was the survivor registry at safe.millennium.berkeley.edu, which was created by graduate students Ka-Ping Yee and Miriam Walker and hosted on the Millennium computer cluster at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the confusion caused by the proliferation of different websites, the Berkeley survivor registry began collecting data from several of the other major sites into one searchable database.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the information was formatted differently from site to site, each site required manual effort and custom programming to download and incorporate its data.

After [[Hurricane Katrina]] displaced hundreds of thousands of people in 2005, online survivor registries again appeared on many different websites. A large volunteer effort called the [[Katrina PeopleFinder Project]] worked to gather and manually re-enter this information into one searchable database provided by [[Salesforce.com]]. An organizer of the project, David Geilhufe, put out a call for technical help to create a data standard that would enable survivor registries to aggregate and share information with each other via automated means.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; also launched searchable databases of Katrina survivors that exchanged information using PFIF.

The next major use of PFIF occurred after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] when Google launched [[Google Person Finder]], which used a data model based on PFIF and exchanged data with [[CNN]], the [[New York Times]], the [[National Library of Medicine]], and other survivor registries using PFIF. However, PFIF 1.1 had made US-specific assumptions that were not applicable to Haiti. Released on January 26, 2010, PFIF 1.2 added fields for a person's home country and international postal code, and fields for sex, age, date of birth, status, and links between duplicate records for the same person.&lt;ref name="pfif1.2"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PFIF 1.3, released in March 2011, addressed the privacy of personal information by adding a field to specify an expiry date on each person record and setting out requirements for data deletion. PFIF 1.3 also moved away from the US-specific assumption of a first and last name by adding one field for a person's full name.&lt;ref name="pfif1.3"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PFIF 1.4, released in May 2012, renamed the name fields to "given_name" and "last_name", added a field for alternate names, added a field for linking to personal profiles on other websites, and added support for multiple photos per person.&lt;ref name="pfif1.4"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8172">'''Procedural knowledge''', also known as '''imperative knowledge''',  is the knowledge exercised in the performance of some task.  See below for the specific meaning of this term in ''[[cognitive psychology]]'' and ''[[intellectual property]]'' law.

In some legal systems, such procedural knowledge has been considered the [[intellectual property]] of a company, and can be transferred when that company is purchased.

One limitation of procedural knowledge is its job-dependent nature. As a result, it tends to be less general than declarative knowledge. For example, a computer expert might have [[knowledge]] about a computer algorithm in multiple languages, or in pseudo-code, but a Visual Basic programmer might know only about a specific implementation of that algorithm, written in Visual Basic. Thus the 'hands-on' expertise and experience of the Visual Basic programmer might be of commercial value only to Microsoft job-shops, for example.

One advantage of procedural knowledge is that it can involve more [[sense]]s, such as hands-on experience, practice at solving problems, understanding of the limitations of a specific solution, etc. Thus procedural knowledge can frequently eclipse theory.

Procedural knowledge (i.e., knowledge-how) is different from [[descriptive knowledge]] (i.e., knowledge-that) in that it can be directly applied to a task.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Burgin, ''Theory of Knowledge: Structures and Processes'', World Scientific, 2016, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the procedural knowledge one uses to solve problems differs from the declarative knowledge one possesses about [[problem solving]] because this knowledge is formed by doing.&lt;ref name=Koedinger&gt;Koedinger, K.R. &amp; Corbett, A. (2006). Technology Bringing Learning Sciences to the Classroom. In Sawyer, R. K. (Ed.), ''The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences'' (61–75).  New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between knowing-how and knowing-that was introduced in [[epistemology]] by [[Gilbert Ryle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason Stanley]] and [[Timothy Williamson]], "Knowing How", ''[[Journal of Philosophy]]'', '''98'''(8): 411–444, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contexts ==

=== Artificial intelligence ===

In ''[[artificial intelligence]]'', procedural knowledge is one type of knowledge that can be possessed by an [[intelligent agent]].  Such knowledge is often represented as a partial or complete  [[finite-state machine]] or [[computer program]].  A well-known example is the [[procedural reasoning system]], which might, in the case of a mobile robot that navigates in a building, contain procedures such as "navigate to a room" or "plan a path".  In contrast, an AI system based on [[declarative knowledge]] might just contain a map of the building, together with information about the basic actions that can be done by the robot (like moving forward, turning, and stopping), and leave it to a domain-independent [[computer planning|planning algorithm]] to discover how to use those actions to achieve the agent's goals.

=== Cognitive psychology ===
{{main|Tacit knowledge}}

In ''[[cognitive psychology]]'', procedural knowledge is the knowledge exercised in the accomplishment of a task, and thus includes knowledge which, unlike [[declarative knowledge]], cannot be easily articulated by the individual, since it is typically nonconscious (or tacit).  Many times, the individual learns procedural knowledge without even being aware that they are learning (Stadler,1989).  For example, most individuals can easily recognize a specific face as "attractive" or a specific joke as "funny", but they cannot explain how exactly they arrived at that conclusion or they cannot provide a working definition of "attractiveness" or being "funny".  This example illustrates the difference between procedural knowledge and the ordinary notion of knowing how, a distinction which is acknowledged by many cognitive psychologists (Stillings, et al. Cognitive Science: An Introduction, 2nd edition, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;396).  Ordinarily, we would not say that one who is able to recognize a face as attractive is one who knows how to recognize a face as attractive. One knows how to recognize faces as attractive no more than one knows how to recognize certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables. Recognizing faces as attractive, like recognizing certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables, is simply something that one does, or is able to do. It is, therefore, an instance of procedural knowledge, though it is not an instance of know-how. Of course, both forms of knowledge are, in many cases, nonconscious. For instance, research by a cognitive psychologist [[Pawel Lewicki]] has demonstrated that procedural knowledge can be acquired by nonconscious processing of information about covariations.

=== Educational implications ===
In the classroom, procedural knowledge is part of the prior knowledge of a student. In the context of formal education procedural knowledge is what is learned about learning strategies.  It can be the "tasks specific rules, skills, actions, and sequences of actions employed to reach goals" a student uses in the classroom (Cauley,1986). As an example for procedural knowledge Cauley refers to how a child learns to count on their hands and/or fingers when first learning math. The Unified Learning Model&lt;ref name="Shell et al, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shell|first=Duane|title=The Unified Learning Model|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-3215-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; explicates that procedural knowledge helps make learning more efficient by reducing the cognitive load of the task. In some educational approaches, particularly when working with students with learning disabilities, educators perform a [http://www.brighthubeducation.com/special-ed-learning-disorders/25800-how-task-analysis-works-for-students-with-special-needs/ task analysis] followed by explicit instruction with the steps needed to accomplish the task.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser, R., "Education and thinking: The role of knowledge", ''American Psychologist'', '''39'''(2): 93–104, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual property law ===

In ''[[intellectual property]]'' law, procedural knowledge is a parcel of closely held information relating to industrial technology, sometimes also referred to as a [[trade secret]] which enables its user to derive commercial benefit from it. It is a component of the intellectual property rights on its own merits in most legislations but most often accompanies the license to the right-of-use of [[patent]]s or [[trademark]]s owned by the party releasing it for circumscribed use. Procedural knowledge is not however solely composed of secret information that is not in the public domain; it is a "bundled" parcel of secret and related non-secret information which would be novel to an expert in the field of its usage.

{{Underlinked|date=February 2013}}

A '''procedure''' is a document written to support a "policy directive". A procedure is designed to describe [[5 Ws|who, what, where, when, and why]] by means of establishing [[corporate accountability]] in support of the implementation of a "policy". 

The "how" is further documented by each organizational unit in the form of "work instructions" which aims to further support a procedure by providing greater detail.

==Exemplary procedure==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
As an example, suppose a manufacturing facility established a policy that all overtime shall be approved. A procedure can be created to establish “Who” can approve overtime (ranks, roles &amp; responsibilities), "What" forms or systems must be used, "Where" they are located, "When" overtime is applicable, and "Why" (i.e., the management directive established via a "policy"). The output of a procedure is an input to a "work instruction" (i.e., a set of [[Action (philosophy)|actions]] or operations which must be executed in the same manner in order to achieve intended results under the same circumstances. (For example, in the latter example, the output of the procedure could be further broken down into a work instruction to describe "how" a manager/employee should access the systems for approving/reviewing overtime (e.g., first click on this hyperlink, second press this button, third choose these fields, and fourth click approve/reject).

USAGE EXAMPLES

•The insurance company provides a step-by-step guide to its dispute and complaint procedures for all policy holders to access.

•The Doctor surprised me when he told me that he had used a new procedure to repair the tear in the tendon of my leg.

•In a work place that has complex interactions among employees, it is important to specify and implement a procedure for core processes.

==Specific types of procedures==
In telecommunications, a '''SOP''' ([[Standard Operating Procedure]]) is specifically designed to describe and guide multiple iterations of the same procedure over a broad number of locations, on multiple occasions, and over an open period of time until such '''SOP''' is updated or discontinued. Also used heavily in the telecommunications industry, a '''MOP''' (Method of Procedure) differs from a '''SOP''' in that it contains specific directives for a particular activity, on a particular date, for a specific location,  piece of equipment, or circumstance. In today's business model, wherein telecom providers can be both "provider" and "user", most "user" organizations require a '''MOP''' from the service provider whenever an activity has the potential to cause a traffic-affecting outage. 

The industry standard is &lt;50ms of traffic interruption. If a "switch hit" or traffic interruption is 50 ms or less, it is "transparent" to the bit stream carrying the traffic, and is therefore considered "hitless" and non-traffic affecting.&lt;ref name=undefined&gt;{{cite book|title=The Froehlich/Kent Encyclopedia of Telecommunications, Volume 3; Volume 16 |authors=Froehlich, Fritz E. &amp; [[Allen Kent|Kent, Allen]] &amp; Hall, Carolyn M. |page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renaissance}}
'''Renaissance technology''' is the set of European artifacts and inventions which span the [[Renaissance]] period, roughly the 14th century through the 16th century. The era is marked by profound technical advancements such as the [[printing press]], [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective in drawing]], [[patent law]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] and [[Star fort|Bastion fortresses]]. Sketchbooks from artisans of the period ([[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]],  example) give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied.

[[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.

== Basic technology ==
Some important Renaissance technologies, including both innovations and improvements on existing techniques:
*mining and metallurgy
*[[blast furnace]] enabled iron to be produced in significant quantities
*[[finery forge]] enabled pig iron (from the blast furnace) into bar iron ([[wrought iron]])
*[[slitting mill]] mechanized the production of iron rods for [[nail (engineering)|nailmaking]]
*[[smeltmill]] increased the output of lead over previous methods ([[bole hill]])

=== Late 14th century ===
Some of the technologies were the [[arquebus]] and the [[musket]].

=== 15th century ===
The technologies that developed in Europe during the second half of the 15th century were commonly associated by authorities of the time with a key theme in Renaissance thought: the rivalry of the Moderns and the Ancients. Three inventions in particular — the printing press, firearms, and the nautical compass — were indeed seen as evidence that the Moderns could not only compete with the Ancients, but had surpassed them, for these three inventions allowed modern people to communicate, exercise power, and finally travel at distances unimaginable in earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Boruchoff 2012, 133-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crankshaft|Crank and connecting rod]]'''
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0006690 Mechanik ^ Wasserförderung ^ Pumpe.jpg|thumb|150px|Water-raising pump powered by crank and connecting rod mechanism ([[Georg Andreas Böckler]], 1661)]]

The [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[connecting rod]] mechanism which converts circular into reciprocal motion is of utmost importance for the mechanization of work processes; it is first attested for [[Hierapolis sawmill|Roman water-powered sawmills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Renaissance, its use is greatly diversified and mechanically refined; now connecting-rods are also applied to double compound cranks, while the [[flywheel]] is employed to get these cranks over the 'dead-spot'.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 112"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence of such machines appears, among other things, in the works of the 15th-century engineers [[Anonymous of the Hussite Wars]] and [[Taccola]].&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 113"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, cranks and connecting rods become an integral part of machine design and are applied in ever more elaborate ways: [[Agostino Ramelli]]'s ''The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines'' of 1588 depicts eighteen different applications, a number which rises in the 17th-century ''Theatrum Machinarum Novum'' by [[Georg Andreas Böckler]] to forty-five.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Printing press]]'''
[[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|left|Two printers operating a Gutenberg-style [[printing press]] (1568). Such presses could make around 3,600 impressions per workday.&lt;ref name="Wolf 1974, 67f."/&gt;]]

The invention of the printing press by the German goldsmith [[Johannes Gutenberg]] (1398–1468) is widely regarded as the single most important event of the second millennium,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm People of the Millenium] for an overview of the wide acclaim. In 1999, the [[A&amp;E Network]] ranked [http://www.wmich.edu/mus-gened/mus170/biography100 Gutenberg no. 1 on their "People of the Millennium" countdown]. In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked [http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310192514/http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm |date=2010-03-10 }}; the same did four prominent US journalists in their 1998 resume [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium]. The [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07090a.htm Johann Gutenberg] entry of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] describes his invention as having made a practically unparalleled cultural impact in the [[Christian era]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the defining moments of the Renaissance. The [[The Printing Revolution|Printing Revolution]] which it sparks throughout Europe works as a modern "agent of change" in the transformation of medieval society.

The mechanical device consists of a [[screw press]] modified for printing purposes which can produce 3,600 pages per workday,&lt;ref name="Wolf 1974, 67f."&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=67f}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the mass production of printed books on a proto-industrial scale. By the start of the 16th century, printing presses are operating in over 200 cities in a dozen European countries, producing more than twenty million volumes.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f"&gt;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean (1976): "The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450–1800", London: New Left Books, quoted in: Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusión del nacionalismo", Fondo de cultura económica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp. 58f&lt;/ref&gt; By 1600, their output had risen tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies, while Gutenberg book printing [[global spread of the printing press|spread from Europe further afield]].&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f" /&gt;

The relatively free flow of information transcends borders and induced a sharp rise in Renaissance literacy, learning and education; the circulation of (revolutionary) ideas among the rising middle classes, but also the peasants, threatens the traditional power monopoly of the ruling nobility and is a key factor in the rapid spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The dawn of the [[Gutenberg Galaxy]], the era of mass communication, is instrumental in fostering the gradual [[democratization of knowledge]] which sees for the first time modern media phenomena such as the [[newspaper#History|press]] or [[bestseller]]s emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prized [[incunable]]s, which are testimony to the aesthetic taste and high proficient competence of Renaissance book printers, are one lasting legacy of the 15th century.

'''[[Parachute]]'''
[[File:Homo Volans.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fausto Veranzio|Veranzio]]'s 1595 parachute design titled "Flying Man"]]

The earliest known parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from 1470s [[Renaissance Italy]];&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Add. MSS 34,113, fol. 200v&lt;/ref&gt; it depicts a free-hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1968, 462f"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1968|pp=462f}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a safety measure, four straps run from the ends of the rods to a waist belt. Around 1485, a more advanced parachute was sketched by the polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in his ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (fol. 381v), which he scales in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1968, 462f"/&gt; Leonardo's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame, altering the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1968, 465"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1968|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetian inventor [[Fausto Veranzio]] (1551–1617) modifies da Vinci's parachute sketch by keeping the square frame, but replacing the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth. This he realized decelerates the fall more effectively.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1968, 465"/&gt; Claims&lt;ref&gt;[[John Wilkins]] (1614–1672): ''Mathematical Magic of the Wonders that may be Performed by Mechanical Geometry, part I: Concerning Mechanical Powers Motion, part II, Dead-loss or Mechanical Motions'', published in London in 1648&lt;/ref&gt; that Veranzio successfully tested his parachute design in 1617 by jumping from a tower in Venice cannot be substantiated; since he was around 65 years old at the time, it seems unlikely.

'''[[Mariner's astrolabe]]'''

The earliest recorded uses of the astrolabe for navigational purposes are by the Portuguese explorers [[Diogo de Azambuja]] (1481), [[Bartholomew Diaz]] (1487/88) and [[Vasco da Gama]] (1497/98) during their [[Portuguese discoveries|sea voyages around Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stimson|1985|p=576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Dry dock]]'''

While dry docks were already known in [[Hellenistic]] shipbuilding,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000a|pp=326−328}}&lt;/ref&gt; these facilities were reintroduced in 1495/96, when [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England ordered one to be built at the [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth navy base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarton|1946|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th century ===
'''[[Dry dock|Floating dock]]'''
[[File:Floating Dock. Woodcut included in the 'Descrittione' of Venice 1560.jpg|thumb|left|Floating dock at Venice (1560)]]

The earliest known description of a floating dock comes from a small Italian book printed in Venice in 1560, titled ''Descrittione dell'artifitiosa machina''. In the booklet, an unknown author asks for the privilege of using a new method for the salvaging of a grounded ship and then proceeds to describe and illustrate his approach. The included [[woodcut]] shows a ship flanked by two large floating trestles, forming a roof above the vessel. The ship is pulled in an upright position by a number of ropes attached to the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarton|1946|pp=153f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domenico Fontana, Lowering of Vatican Obelisk, Rome, 1586.jpg|thumb|Relocation of the Vatican Obelisk, Rome, by [[Domenico Fontana]] (1586)]]
'''[[Crane (machine)#History|Lifting tower]]'''

A lifting tower was used to great effect by [[Domenico Fontana]] to relocate the monolithic [[List of obelisks in Rome|Vatican obelisk]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 1999 428"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its weight of 361 t was far greater than any of the blocks the Romans are known to have lifted by cranes.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 1999 428"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;53.3 t at [[Trajan's Column]] ({{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=426}}); 60−100 t at the Jupiter temple of [[Baalbek]] ({{harvnb|Coulton|1974|p=16}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|left|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]

'''Mining, machinery and chemistry'''
A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

=== Early 17th century ===
'''[[Newspaper]]'''
[[File:Relation Aller Fuernemmen und gedenckwuerdigen Historien (1609).jpg|thumb|left|Title page of the ''[[Relation (journal)|Relation]]'' (1609), the earliest newspaper&lt;ref&gt;World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html "Newspapers: 400 Years Young!"]; {{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The newspaper is an offspring of the printing press from which the [[newspaper|press]] derives its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th century sees a rising demand for up-to-date information which can not be covered effectively by the circulating [[Avviso|hand-written newssheets]]. For "gaining time" from the slow copying process, [[Johann Carolus]] of Strassburg is the first to publish his German-language ''Relation'' by using a printing press (1605).&lt;ref name="Weber 2006, 396f"&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rapid succession, further German newspapers are established in Wolfenbüttel (''[[Avisa Relation oder Zeitung]]''), Basel, Frankfurt and Berlin.&lt;ref name="Weber 2006, 396f"/&gt; From 1618 onwards, enterprising Dutch printers take up the practice and begin to provide the English and French market with translated news.&lt;ref name="Weber 2006, 396f"/&gt; By the mid-17th century it is estimated that political newspapers which enjoyed the widest popularity reach up to 250,000 readers in the Holy Roman Empire, around one quarter of the literate population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Air-gun'''

In 1607 Bartolomeo Crescentio described an air-gun equipped with a powerful spiral spring, a device so complex that it must have had predecessors.{{Or|date=January 2011}} In 1610 Mersenne spoke in detail of "sclopeti pneumatici constructio", and four years later [[John Wilkins|Wilkins]] wrote enthusiastically of "that late ingenious invention the wind-gun" as being "almost equall to our powder-guns". In the 1650s Otto von Guericke, famed for his experiments with vacua and pressures, built the ''Madeburger Windbuchse'', one of the technical wonders of its time.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Tools, devices, work processes ==

=== 15th century ===
'''[[Archimedes' screw|Cranked Archimedes' screw]]'''

The German engineer [[Konrad Kyeser]] equips in his ''[[Bellifortis]]'' (1405) the Archimedes' screw with a crank mechanism which soon replaces the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|pp=105, 111, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Reel|Cranked reel]]'''

In the textile industry, cranked [[reel]]s for winding skeins of yarn were introduced in the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"/&gt;

'''[[Brace (tool)|Brace]]'''

The earliest carpenter's braces equipped with a U-shaped grip, that is with a [[Crank (mechanism)|compound crank]], appears between 1420 and 1430 in [[Flanders]].&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 112"/&gt;

'''Cranked well-hoist'''

The earliest evidence for the fitting of a well-hoist with cranks is found in a miniature of c. 1425 in the German ''Hausbuch of the Mendel Foundation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=167}}; {{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Paddle wheel boat|Paddle wheel boat powered by crank and connecting rod mechanism]]'''

While paddle wheel boats powered by manually turned [[crankshaft]]s were already conceived of by earlier writers such as [[Guido da Vigevano]] and the [[Anonymous Author of the Hussite Wars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|pp=80f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Roberto Valturio]] much improves on the design in 1463 by devising a boat with five sets of parallel cranks which are all joined to a single power source by one [[connecting rod]]; the idea is also taken up by his compatriot [[Francesco di Giorgio]].&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 114"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Grindstone (tool)|Rotary grindstone with treadle]]'''

Evidence for rotary grindstones operated by a crank handle goes back to the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] ''[[Utrecht Psalter]]''.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 110"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1480, the crank mechanism is further mechanized by adding a [[treadle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geared hand-mill'''

The geared hand-mill, operated either with one or two cranks, appears in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical drawings of artist-engineers ==
{{HistOfTech}}
The revived scientific spirit of the age can perhaps be best exemplified by the voluminous corpus of [[technical drawing]]s which the artist-engineers left behind, reflecting the wide variety of interests the Renaissance [[Homo universalis]] pursued. The establishment of the laws of linear perspective by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] gave his successors, such as [[Taccola]], [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], a powerful instrument to depict mechanical devices for the first time in a realistic manner. The extant sketch books give modern historians of science invaluable insights into the standards of technology of the time. Renaissance engineers showed a strong proclivity to experimental study, drawing a variety of technical devices, many of which appeared for the first time in history on paper.

However, these designs were not always intended to be put into practice, and often practical limitations impeded the application of the revolutionary designs. For example, da Vinci's ideas on the conical [[parachute]] or the winged flying machine were only applied much later. While earlier scholars showed a tendency to attribute inventions based on their first pictorial appearance to individual Renaissance engineers, modern scholarship is more prone to view the devices as products of a technical evolution which often went back to the Middle Ages.

'''Riovic''' is a [[Fintech|financial technology]] company that owns and operates a technology platform that enables private investors to invest in insurance risks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Fripp |url=http://www.htxt.co.za/2016/04/21/riovic-insurance-startup/ |title="Uber of insurance" has big plans for South Africa's startups - htxt.africa |publisher=Htxt.co.za |date= |accessdate=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://techmoran.com/riovic-uber-insurance/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=327840719 |title=Riovic Corporation: Private Company Information - Businessweek |website=Bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015 the company officially launched a money transfer service called RiovicPay to help people access cross-border money remittance services on holidays and after hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmenewsnetwork.com/middle-east-africa/news/item/4312-riovicpay-issued-credit-as-part-of-its-pre-launch-campaign |title=RiovicPay issued credit as part of its pre-launch campaign |website=Gsmenewsnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was rebranded to AfricanRemit. It then released the its [[On-demand outsourcing|on-demand]] platform for financial services, labeled the ''Uber of Finance'' in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2015/11/female-tech-entrepreneur-develops-on-demand-network-for-financial-advice/ |title=Female tech entrepreneur develops on-demand network for financial advice &amp;#124; &amp;#124; IT News Africa- Africa's Technology News Leader |publisher=IT News Africa |date= |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=148144 |title=Start-up unveils virtual financial advice service |website=ITWeb.co.za |date=2015-11-27 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innov8tiv.com/female-techpreneur-naledi-mokoena-founded-on-demand-network-for-financial-advice/ |title=Female Techpreneur Naledi Mokoena Founded On-Demand Network For Financial Advice |website=Innov8tiv.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform provided [[financial adviser]]s, [[Crowdfunding|crowd investing]] and [[Peer-to-peer insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ventureburn.com/2015/12/riovic-wants-to-be-the-personal-financial-advisor-in-your-pocket/ |title=Riovic wants to be the personal financial advisor in your pocket – Ventureburn |website=Ventureburn.com |date=2015-12-11 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.ceceliawrights.co.za/index.php/2016/01/14/two-is-a-couple-three-is-a-crowd-a-rich-crowd/ |title=Two is a couple, Three is a crowd… A rich crowd! &amp;#124; |website=Ceceliawrights.co.za |date=2016-01-14 |accessdate=2016-04-11 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the company was labelled the [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd's]] of FinTech and successfully launched this revised model to eliminate insurance companies in the insurance value by directly connecting brokers and consumers with risk capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/357/142762.html |title=The Uber of finance |website=Bizcommunity.com |date=2016-04-01 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also labelled the "Uber of Insurance", Riovic pioneered "private investor backed insurance" where a private investor (or group of private investors) essentially steps into the financial shoes of the insurer, accepting a stream of certain cash flows in exchange for an uncertain future liability.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Riovic has a collaboration with New Zealand's PeerCover and was admitted into South African [[Rand Merchant Investment Holdings|Rand Merchant Investment Holdings' (RMIH)]] incubator for next generation financial services companies (similar to Level39), which provides the company with working space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/feb/22/startup-of-the-year-2015-2016-competition-entry-riovic |title=Startup of the Year 2015-2016 competition entry: Nkambule Ltd &amp;#124; Guardian Small Business Network |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2016-02-22 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of Facebook's FBStart accelerator programme.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Pension Mistakes by Expats in Dubai|url=http://holbornassets.com/holborn-assets-reviews-10-pension-mistakes-by-expats-in-dubai/|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network '''routing in a cellular network''' deals with the challenges of traditional [[telephony]] such as switching and call setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsp/article.php/3607381/Networking-101-Understanding-Routing.htm | title=Networking and Understanding Routing | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most [[cellular network]] routing issues in different cells can be attributed to the multiple access methods used for transmission. The location of each mobile phone must be known to reuse a given band of frequencies in different cells and forms [[space-division multiple access]] (SDMA).

==Networks==
[[FDMA]] is one of the multiple access methods used in cellular networks. 50&amp;nbsp;MHz blocks of communication channel are assigned, which lie in radio frequency range and contain an equal number of uplinks (terminal to base station) and downlinks (base station to terminal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenetworkencyclopedia.com/entry/frequency-division-multiple-access-fdma/ | title=Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and cellular phone technology | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more bidirectional channels are carried by 10-90 band pairs. The digital networks additionally make use of either [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] or [[Time-division multiple access|TDMA]] methods.

===Handover and roaming===
A special service called [[mobility management]] provides this application. Terminals (handsets) can move from one place to another during the call and therefore requires the call to be [[Handover|handed over]] from one channel to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://itsec.rwth-aachen.de/publications/dis_ulrike_meyer.pdf | title=Secure Roaming and Handover Procedures in Wireless Access Net works | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft handover uses the same frequency channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://morse.colorado.edu/~tlen5510/text/classwebch2.html | title=Cellular systems and frequency reuse | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same terminals can operate in the same area covered by different service providers, which is known as [[roaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ustudy.in/node/7179 | title=Roaming and Handoff | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SDEP''' ('''Street events Data Exchange Protocol''') comprises an [[XML schema|XML data schema]] and web service [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] for exchanging information about streetworks, roadworks, and street events between systems.

Elgin was funded by the UK NeSDS Government e-Standards Programme to conduct a consultation and convene meetings to define the requirements of a common data exchange protocol for streetworks registers and other systems handling street events data. SDEP was developed to allow the open exchange of such data between back office systems used by [[local authorities]] to manage their highway networks in order to enable [[EGovernment|e-Government]] and streetworks co-ordination.

The SDEP consultation group comprised ELGIN (Chair), Mayrise Ltd., Symology Ltd., [[Pitney Bowes|Pitney Bowes Inc.]], [[Bentley Systems|Exor Corporation (Bentley Systems)]], &lt;!-- [[Northamptonshire|Northamptonshire County Council]] (representing the --&gt;[[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]]&lt;!--)--&gt; and [[Transport for London]], with the [[Highways Agency|National Traffic Control Centre]] in an observing capacity.

{{About|mobile telephone messaging|the early computer programming language|Short Code (computer language)}}

'''Short codes''', or '''short numbers''', are short digit sequences, significantly shorter than [[telephone number]]s, that are used to address messages in the [[Multimedia Messaging System]] (MMS) and [[short message service]] (SMS) systems of [[mobile network operator]]s. In addition to messaging, they may be used in [[abbreviated dialing]].

Short codes are designed to be easier to read and remember than telephone numbers. Short codes are unique to each operator at the technological level. Even so, providers generally have agreements to avoid overlaps. In some countries, such as the United States, some classes of numbers are inter-operator (U.S. inter-operator numbers are called '''common short codes''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.youra.com/stats/mobileuse.pdf | title=Common Short Codes: Cracking The Mobile Marketing Code | accessdate=2014-01-08 | author=Neufeld, Evan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short codes are widely used for value-added services such as [[Mobile donating|charity donations]], mobile services, ordering [[ringtones]], and television program voting. Messages sent to a short code can be billed at a higher rate than a standard SMS and may even subscribe a customer to a recurring monthly service that will be added to the customer's mobile phone bill until the user texts, for example, the word "STOP" to terminate the service.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Short codes and service identifiers (prefix) ==
Short codes are often associated with automated services. An automated program can handle the response and typically requires the sender to start the message with a command word or prefix. The service then responds to the command appropriately.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In ads or in other printed material where a provider has to provide both a prefix and the short code number, the advertisement will typically follow this format:{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
*Example 1 - Long version:  Text Football to 72404 for latest football news.
*Example 2 - Short version: football@72404

== Regional differences ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}

; Albania: Short Codes are five digits in length and start with 5, also are known as short codes for value added service.

; Australia: Short codes are six or eight digits in length, starting with the prefix "19" followed by an additional four or six digits and two. Communications Alliance Ltd and WMC Global are responsible for governing premium and standard rate short codes in Australia. Transactional and Subscription services require a double sms MO opt-in or Web based opt-in with an MO reply.

; Belgium: Codes are four digits in length.

; Brazil: Codes are five digits in length.

; Cambodia: Short Codes are four digits in length and start with 1.

; Canada: Canadian Common Short Codes can be five or six digits long. Common Short Codes beginning with a leading '4' are reserved for private use by wireless network operators. Four-digit Common Short Codes are not permitted due to handset incompatibilities. Short code-based messages vary between ''zero-rated'' (paid for by campaign), ''standard rate'' (user is responsible for standard carrier charges), and ''premium rate'' (varies, [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1-10). Canadian Short codes are governed by the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txt.ca/ |title=TXT Splash |publisher=Txt.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Chile: Codes are three and four digits in length.

; Czech Republic: Messages sent to/from these short codes are known as Premium Rate SMS. Codes are seven digits in length for MO and five (not billed) or eight (billed) for MT direction, starting with nine, while two or three (depending on billing type=MO/MT) trailing digits express the price, e.g. SMS sent to 9090930 is billed for [[Czech koruna|Kč]]30. Leading three digits are purpose type prefixes (908 for micropayments, 909 for adult content and 900 for everything else), digits at position four and five determines the service provider registered by a network operator. There are also other four digit shortcodes, used by a network operators for service only purposes (operator dependent)

; Denmark: Codes are four digits in length.

; Dominican Republic: Codes are four or five digits in length.

; European Union: Common EU-wide codes start with 11. Examples include: 118xxx - directory services, 116xxx - emergency helplines. This is in addition to the EU-wide emergency number 112.
'''Ethiopia'''

Codes are four digits in length and start with 8, like 8xxx. Although the telecom sector in Ethiopia is controlled by the government, short code services are outsourced to the private sector. The short codes are used mostly for fundraising, lottery and polling.

; Finland: Codes are five or more digits in length, usually five or six.

; France: Codes are five digits in length. Starting digits define the cost of the service.

; Germany: Codes are four or five digits in length.

; Greece: Codes are five digits in length.

; Hungary: Codes are four or five digits in length.

; India: There are many companies in the Indian market who rent keywords, on a monthly basis, whose characters, on a typical [[telephone keypad]], represent short codes.  Short codes are five digits in length and have to start with the digit  '5'. The five digits can be extended by three digits further representing three additional characters. Texts sent to these Short Codes are commonly referred to as Premium Rate SMS Messages and cost around [[Indian rupee|Rs]] 1 to Rs 3 per text depending on the operator as well as the service. Any length of full message can be sent, ranging from 100&amp;ndash;500 (some providers only support).

; Indonesia: Codes are four digits in length with [[Indonesian rupiah|Rp]]2000 premium price.

; Republic of Ireland: Short codes are five digits in length, and start with 5. The second digit generally indicates the maximum price, with 0 = completely free, 1 = standard text rate only, 3 = [[Euro|€]]0.60, and 7 having no maximum. Codes beginning 59 are ostensibly intended for adult services, but few if any of these codes are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regtel.ie |title=Commission for Communications Regulation - RegTel Information |publisher=Regtel.ie |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Italy: In Italy short codes have no fixed length, starting from three digits up to five. All short codes that start with the digit "4", are designated by a local telecommunications law for "network services". Widely known short codes are in the 48xxx range, commercial ringtones and mobile stuff download.

; Korea, South: Codes are generally four to six digits in length, however short codes have no fixed length.

; Latvia: In Latvia short codes also have no fixed length, starting from three digits up to five. All 4 digit short codes that start with "118" or 5 digit short codes that start with "1184" are designated to information service providers.

; Lithuania: In Lithuania short codes also have no fixed length, starting from three digits up to five. All short codes that start with the digit "1", are designated by a local telecommunications law for "network services".

; Malaysia: Codes are five digits in length, start with "2" or "3", premium pricing from [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]]0.30 up to 10.00. Codes are MT billed so subscription services are allowed. Upon service description approval by mobile operators, dedicated codes are generally live in 4 weeks, and shared codes after 1 week.

; Morocco: Code are four keys digits in length.

; Nepal: Codes are three to four digits in length. Dialing shortcodes are generally 3 digits, and reserved for public services. SMS shortcodes are used for a range of purposes, and are four digits.

; The Netherlands: Codes are four digits in length.

; Nigeria: Codes are four to five digits in length.

; Norway: Codes are four and five digits in length.

; New Zealand: Codes are three and four digits in length.

; Pakistan: Codes are three and four digits in length. Users are charged PKR 5 - PKR 25 per SMS sent on short codes. Mobile operators charge a setup fee, monthly fee and fee per keyword for short codes. Short codes usage must abide by the rules set by PTA (Pakistan Telecom Authority).

; Panama: Codes are four digits in length.

; Poland: Commercial codes are five digit long (1xxxx) and are reachable from both mobile and fixed networks. Calls to short codes - from any type of network - are routed based on the location of the number originating the call; hence, if wishing to reach a particular geographical area, the subscriber might need to prefix the short code with an appropriate area code.

; Philippines: Codes are four digits in length. The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) is a regulatory agency providing an environment that ensures reliable, affordable and viable infrastructure and services in information and communications technology (ICT) accessible to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.ntc.gov.ph/wps/portal |title=The National Telecommunications Commission Web Portal |publisher=Portal.ntc.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930121357/http://portal.ntc.gov.ph/wps/portal |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the NTC is ultimately responsible for the governance of premium and non-premium shortcodes in the Philippines, the NTC's regulatory guidelines are not comprehensive when applied to shortcodes. Instead NTC's guidelines focus more on the carriers and the carrier's technical infrastructure. NTC's website does not contain any specific information with regard to premium SMS or standard rate SMS. There is relevant documentation for Bulk SMS and SPAM control via NTC's "AMENDMENT TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS ON BROADCAST MESSAGING SERVICES", however again is not directly related to premium SMS.

; Russia: Codes are four digits in length. The cost of the call or SMS to the short number varies from 1.2 to 300 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], depending on the number and the carrier.

; Serbia: Codes are four digits in length.

; Singapore: Codes are five digits in length.

; South Africa: Codes are five digits in length. Short codes will start with either a "3" or "4". For example, 34001 or 42001. Each short code or short code range (a range will generally be 34000 to 34009) are assigned specific tariffs or end user prices (EUP). The tariff charges can range from [[South African rand|R]]0.50 to R30.00 on mobile originated billing and from R0.50 to R50.00 using mobile terminated billing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waspa.org.za |title=WASPA Website |publisher=Waspa.org.za |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smscode.co.za |title=sms c.o.d.e.s |publisher=Smscode.co.za |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to high costs associated with short code rental many providers offer shared shortcodes, which greatly reduces costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicsms.co.za/PremiumSMS/Default.html |title=Shared Shortcodes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Spain: Codes are four digits in length.

; Sweden: Codes are five digits in length.

; Switzerland: Codes are three to five digits in length (most popular codes are three digits long); codes starting with "6" are reserved for adult services.

; Taiwan: Codes are usually four digits in length, starting with digits "19".

; Turkey: Codes are four digits in length.

; United Kingdom: Codes are five digits in length, mostly starting with 6 or 8. Codes starting 70 are used by charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.short-codes.com/ |title=Short-Codes.com |publisher=Short-Codes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of codes may be expanded in time to use other leading digits such as 4. Adult related mobile services must use codes starting with 69 or 89. Mobile operators sometimes use proprietary codes (either with a different leading digit or shorter in length for their own use). SMS short codes are often owned by holding companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smsshortcodes.co.uk/shared-and-dedicated-shortcodes.htm | title=A Short Guide to a (UK) Short Code | work=SMSshortcodes.co.uk | date=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; who then lease them out to service providers and advertisers to promote SMS services, charitable fundraising and marketing promotions such as news alerts, voting and quizzes. Shortcodes can also be used to deliver additional content or a mobile URL link that when prompted opens the mobile web browser linking the user to a mobile web page. Premium SMS services use codes that can be set to deliver a charge to a participant’s mobile phone (in accordance with the service provider’s terms of service). Other codes (typically used by advertisers) can be free to receive “your standard rate applies” or free to send and receive. UK Premium rated SMS services are regulated by [[PhonepayPlus]]. All charges and associated terms linked to a premium code should be transparent to the consumer. To stop a subscription based shortcode service text the word 'STOP' to the shortcode number.

; United States: As of May 31, 2006, the standard lengths for interoperable short codes are five and six digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usshortcodes.com/csc_press053106.html | title=Common Short Code Administration Announces Open Registration of 6-Digit Codes | publisher=CTIA | work=Press Release | date=2006-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers use short codes with fewer digits for carrier-specific programs - e.g., "Text [[6-1-1|611]] to see how many minutes you have remaining on your plan." Codes starting with 1 are not permitted. Common short codes in the U.S. are leased by the program's registry service provider [[iconectiv]], under a deal with the [[Common Short Code Administration]] and [[Cellular Telecommunications &amp; Internet Association|CTIA]].&lt;ref name="wirelessweek"/&gt; Short codes are leased at a price, with a selected code costing twice that of a random code.&lt;ref name="wirelessweek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wirelessweek.com/news/2007/04/decoding-short-codes | title=Decoding Short Codes | work=WirelessWeek | date=2007-04-15 | author=Alleven, Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some carriers assign a subset of their carrier-specific codes to third parties.&lt;ref name="Short1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctia.org/resource-library/press-releases/archive/ctia-announced-new-strategic-partner-iconectiv-for-common-short-code-registry-services |title=CTIA Announced New Strategic Partner iconectiv for Common Short Code Registry Services |publisher=[[CTIA – The Wireless Association]] |date=2015-07-30 |accessdate=2016-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical communicators generally tailor information to a specific audience, which may be subject matter experts, consumers, end users, etc. Technical communicators often work collaboratively to create [[deliverable]]s that include [[online help]], user [[user guide|manual]]s, classroom training guides, computer-based training, [[white paper]]s, [[specification]]s, [[industrial video]]s, [[reference card]]s, [[data sheet]]s, [[journal article]]s, and [[patent]]s.
[[Vocational education|Technical]] domains can be of any kind, including the soft and hard [[science]]s, [[high technology]] including [[computer]]s and [[software]] and [[consumer electronics]]. Technical communicators often work with a range of specific [[Subject-matter expert]]s (SMEs) on these educational projects.

Technical communication jobs include the following:&lt;ref name=whirl/&gt;
[[API writer]], [[e-learning author]], [[information architect]], [[technical content developer]], [[technical editor]], [[technical illustrator]], [[technical trainer]], [[technical translator]], [[technical writer]], [[usability expert]], [[user experience designer]], and [[user interface designer]]. Other jobs available to technical communicators include digital strategist, marketing specialist, and content manager.

In 2015, the [[European Association for Technical Communication]] published a competence framework for the professional field of technical communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://competences.technical-communication.org/overview.html Competence Framework for Technical Communication] at the tekom Europe official website. Last updated October 2015. Accessed October 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like technology and the world economy, technical communication as a profession has evolved over the last half-century. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Content creation&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Information mapping]]; do not rename heading without fixing incoming link ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
{{See also|Information mapping}}

Technical communication is a task performed by specialized employees or consultants. For example, a professional writer may work with a company to produce a user manual. Some companies give considerable technical communication responsibility to other technical professionals—such as programmers, engineers, and scientists. Often, a professional technical writer edits such work to bring it up to modern technical communication standards.

To begin the documentation process, technical communicators identify the audience and their information needs. The technical communicator researches and structures the content into a framework that can guide detailed development. As the body of information comes together, the technical communicator ensures that the intended audience can understand the content and retrieve the information they need. This process, known as the [[writing process]], has been a central focus of writing theory since the 1970s, and some contemporary textbook authors apply it to technical communication. Technical communication is important to most professions, as a way to contain and organize information and maintain accuracy.

The [[technical writing]] process is based on Cicero's 5 canons of [[rhetoric]], and can be divided into six steps:

# Determine purpose and audience
# Collect information ([[inventio|Invention]])
# Organize and outline information ([[Dispositio|Arrangement]])
# Write the first draft ([[Elocutio|Style]])
# Revise and edit ([[Memoria|Memory]])
# Publish output ([[Pronuntiatio|Delivery]])

===Determining purpose and audience===

All technical communication serves a particular purpose—typically to communicate ideas and concepts to an audience, or instruct an audience in a particular task.  Technical communication professionals use various techniques to understand the audience and, when possible, test content on the target audience. For example, if bank workers don't properly post deposits, a technical communicator would review existing instructional material (or lack thereof), interview bank workers to identify conceptual errors, interview subject matter experts to learn the correct procedures, author new material that instructs workers in the correct procedures, and test the new material on the bank workers.

Similarly, a sales manager who wonders which of two sites is better for a new store might ask a marketing professional to study the sites and write a report with recommendations. The marketing professional hands the report off to a technical communicator (in this case, a technical editor or technical writer), who edits, formats, and sometimes elaborates the document in order to make the marketing professional's expert assessment usable to the sales manager. The process is not one of knowledge transfer, but the accommodation of knowledge across fields of expertise and contexts of use. This is the basic definition of technical communication.

Audience type affects many aspects of communication, from word selection and graphics use to style and organization. Most often, to address a particular audience, a technical communicator must consider what qualities make a text useful (capable of supporting a meaningful task) and usable (capable of being used in service of that task). A non-technical audience might misunderstand or not even read a document that is heavy with jargon—while a technical audience might crave detail critical to their work. Busy audiences often don't have time to read entire documents, so content must be organized for ease of searching—for example by frequent [[:wikt:heading|headings]], [[White space (visual arts)|white space]], and other cues that guide [[attention]]. Other requirements vary according to particular audience's needs.

Technical communication in the government is particular and detailed. Depending on the segment of government (and country), the government component must follow distinct specifications. Information changes continuously and technical communications (technical manuals, interactive electronic technical manuals, technical bulletins, etc.) must be updated.

===Collecting information===

Technical communicators must collect all information that each document requires. They may collect information through primary (first-hand) research—or secondary research, using information from existing work by other authors. Technical communicators must acknowledge all sources they use to produce their work. To this end, technical communicators typically distinguish quotations, paraphrases, and summaries when taking notes.

===Organizing and outlining information===

Before writing the initial draft, the technical communicator organizes ideas in a way that makes the document flow well. Once each idea is organized, the writer organizes the document as a whole—accomplishing this task in various ways: chronological: used for documents that involve a linear process, such as a step-by-step guide that describes how to accomplish something; parts of an object: Used for documents that describe the parts of an object, such as a graphic showing the parts of a computer (keyboard, monitor, mouse, etc.); simple to complex (or vice versa): starts with easy ideas and gradually goes into complex ideas; specific to general: starts with many ideas, then organizes the ideas into sub-categories; general to specific: starts with a few categories of ideas, then goes deeper

After organizing the whole document, the writer typically creates a final outline that shows the document structure. Outlines make the writing process easier and save the author time.

===Writing the first draft===

After the outline is complete, the writer begins the first draft, following the outline's structure. Setting aside blocks of an hour or more, in a place free of distractions, helps the writer maintain a flow. Most writers prefer to wait until the draft is complete before any revising so they don't break their flow. Typically, the writer should start with the easiest section, and write the summary only after the body is drafted.

The ABC (''a''bstract, ''b''ody, and ''c''onclusion) format can be used when writing a first draft of some document types. The abstract describes the subject, so that the reader knows what the document covers. The body is the majority of the document and covers topics in depth.  Lastly, the conclusion section restates the document's main topics. The ABC format can also apply to individual paragraphs—beginning with a topic sentence that states the paragraph's topic, followed by the topic, and finally, a concluding sentence.

===Revising and editing===

Once the initial draft is laid out, editing and revising can be done to fine-tune the draft into a final copy. Four tasks transform the early draft into its final form, suggested by Pfeiffer and Boogard:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

====Adjusting and reorganizing content====

In this step, the writer revises the draft to elaborate on topics that need more attention, shorten other sections—and relocate certain paragraphs, sentences, or entire topics.

====Editing for style====

Good style makes writing more interesting, appealing, and readable. In general, the personal writing style of the writer is not evident in technical writing. Modern technical writing style relies on attributes that contribute to clarity: headings, lists, graphics; generous white space, short sentences, present tense, simple nouns, [[active voice]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 63. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though some scientific applications still use the [[passive voice]]), second and third person as required

Technical writing as a discipline usually requires that a technical writer use a [[style guide]]. These guides may relate to a specific project, product, company, or brand. They ensure that technical writing reflects formatting, punctuation, and general stylistic standards that the audience expects. In the United States, many consider the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'' the bible for general technical communication. Other style guides have their adherents, particularly for specific industries—such as the ''Microsoft Style Guide'' in some information technology settings.

====Editing for grammar and punctuation====

At this point, the writer performs a ''mechanical edit'', checking the document for grammar, punctuation, common word confusions, passive voice, overly long sentences, etc.

'''Technogaianism''' (a [[portmanteau]] word combining "techno-" for [[technology]] and "gaian" for [[Gaia philosophy]]) is a [[bright green environmentalist]] stance of active support for the research, development and use of [[emerging technologies|emerging and future technologies]] to help restore [[Earth]]'s [[Natural environment|environment]]. Technogaians argue that developing safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]] should be an important goal of [[environmentalist]]s.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James| title = [[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future| publisher = Westview Press| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

This point of view is different from the default position of [[Radical environmentalism|radical environmentalists]] and a common opinion that all technology necessarily degrades the environment, and that [[environmental restoration]] can therefore occur only with [[neo-luddism|reduced reliance on technology]]. Technogaians argue that technology gets cleaner and more efficient with time. They would also point to such things as [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]s to demonstrate that developments do not have to come at the environment's expense. More directly, they argue that such things as [[nanotechnology]] and [[biotechnology]] can directly reverse [[environmental degradation]]. [[Molecular nanotechnology]], for example, could [[List of solid waste treatment technologies|convert garbage in landfills into useful materials and products]], while biotechnology could lead to novel [[List of nuclear waste treatment technologies|microbes that devour hazardous waste]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

While many environmentalists{{Who|date=January 2015}} still contend that ''most'' technology is detrimental to the environment, technogaians point out that it has been in humanity's best interests to exploit the environment mercilessly until fairly recently. This sort of behaviour follows accurately to current understandings of [[punctuated equilibrium|evolutionary systems]], in that when new factors (such as foreign [[species]] or [[mutant]] [[subspecies]]) are introduced into an [[ecosystem]], they tend to maximise their own [[resource consumption]] until either, ''a)'' they reach an equilibrium beyond which they cannot continue unmitigated growth, or ''b)'' they become extinct. In these models, it is ''completely impossible'' for such a factor to totally destroy its host environment, though they may precipitate [[ecological crisis|major ecological transformation]] before their ultimate eradication.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Technogaians believe humanity has currently reached just such a threshold, and that the only way for human civilization to continue advancing is to accept the tenets of technogaianism and limit future exploitive exhaustion of [[natural resource]]s and minimize further [[sustainable development|unsustainable development]] or face the widespread, ongoing [[Holocene extinction event|mass extinction of species]].&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Michael Rosenzweig|Rosenzweig, Michael]]| title = Win-Win Ecology: How The Earth's Species Can Survive In The Midst of Human Enterprise| publisher = Clarendon Press| year = 2005| isbn = 0-19-515604-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive effects of modern civilization can be mitigated by technological solutions, such as using nuclear power. Furthermore, technogaians argue that only science and technology can help humanity be aware of, and possibly develop counter-measures for, [[risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]] such as a possible [[Asteroid impact avoidance|impact event]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; 

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] mentions Walter Truett Anderson, author of ''To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal'', as an example of a technogaian political philosopher;&lt;ref name="Anderson 1987"&gt;{{cite book| author = Anderson, Walter Truett| title = To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal| publisher = Harcourt| year = 1987| isbn = 0-15-190483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that technogaianism applied to [[environmental management]] is found in the [[reconciliation ecology]] writings such as [[Michael Rosenzweig]]'s ''Win-Win Ecology: How The Earth's Species Can Survive In The Midst of Human Enterprise'';&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"/&gt; and considers [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Viridian design movement]] to be an exemplary technogaian initiative.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[Bruce Sterling|Sterling, Bruce]] | title = Viridian: The Manifesto of January 3, 2000|    year = 2001 | url = http://www.viridiandesign.org/manifesto.html| accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theories of English writer Fraser Clark may be broadly categorised as technogaian.{{according to whom|date=December 2014}} Clark advocated "balancing the hippie right brain with the techno left brain". The idea of combining technology and ecology were extrapolated at length by a South African eco-anarchist project in the 1990s. The [[Kagenna Magazine]] project aimed to combine technology, art and ecology in an emerging movement that could restore the balance between human and nature.

[[George Dvorsky]] suggests the sentiment of technogaianism is to heal the Earth, use [[sustainable technology]], and create ecologically diverse environments.&lt;ref name = dvorsky&gt;[http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2013/02/7-best-case-scenarios-for-future-of.html?spref=tw George Dvorsky, 7 Best-Case Scenarios for the Future of Humanity, Sentient Developments, (Feb. 2, 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt; Dvorsky argues that defensive counter measures could be designed to counter the harmful effects of asteroid impacts, [[earthquakes]], and  [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]].&lt;ref name = dvorsky/&gt; Dvorksky also suggest that genetic engineering could be used to reduce the environmental impact humans have on the earth.&lt;ref name = dvorsky/&gt;

===Geoengineering===
{{See also|Climate engineering}}

Climate engineering is a technogaian method that uses two categories of technologies- [[carbon dioxide removal]] and [[solar radiation management]]. Carbon dioxide removal addresses a cause of climate change by removing one of the [[greenhouse gases]] from the [[atmosphere]]. Solar radiation management attempts to offset effects of greenhouse gases by causing the [[Earth]] to absorb less [[solar radiation]].

[[Earthquake engineering]] is a technogaian method concerned with protecting society and the natural and man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to acceptable levels.&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-8493-1439-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example of a technogaian practice is an artificial [[closed ecological system]] used to test if and how people could live and work in a closed [[biosphere]], while carrying out [[scientific experiment]]s. It is in some cases used to explore the possible use of closed biospheres in [[space colonization]], and also allows the study and manipulation of a biosphere without harming Earth's.&lt;ref name="Gitelson, Livovsky &amp; MacElroy 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gitelson, I.

===Genetic engineering===
{{See also|Genetic engineering|Genetically modified food controversies}}
S. Matthew Liao, professor of philosophy and bioethics at [[New York University]], claims that the [[human impact on the environment]] could be reduced by [[Gene therapy|genetically engineering humans]] to have, a smaller stature, an intolerance to eating meat, and an increased ability to see in the dark, thereby using less lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/how-engineering-the-human-body-could-combat-climate-change/253981/ Ross Anderson, How Engineering the Human Body Could Combat Climate Change, The Atlantic, (March 12, 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; Liao argues that human engineering is less risky than [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smatthewliao.com/2012/02/09/human-engineering-and-climate-change/ S. Mathew Liao, Human Engineering and Climate Change, (Feb. 12, 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetically modified food]]s have reduced the amount of [[herbicide]] and [[insecticide]] needed for cultivation. The development of glyphosate-resistant ([[Roundup Ready]]) plants has changed the herbicide use profile away from more environmentally persistent herbicides with higher toxicity, such as [[atrazine]], [[metribuzin]] and [[alachlor]], and reduced the volume and danger of herbicide runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18268303 | doi=10.2134/jeq2006.0540 | volume=37 | issue=2 | year=2008 | pages=401–8 |vauthors=Shipitalo MJ, Malone RW, Owens LB | title = Impact of Glyphosate-Tolerant Soybean and Glufosinate-Tolerant Corn Production on Herbicide Losses in Surface Runoff | journal = Journal of Environment Quality| url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=21799&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23422">'''Technological utopianism''' (often called '''techno-utopianism''' or '''technoutopianism''') is any [[ideology]] based on the premise that advances in science and technology could and should bring about a [[utopia]], or at least help to fulfill one or another utopian ideal.

A '''techno-utopia''' is therefore an ideal [[society]], in which laws, government, and social conditions are solely operating for the benefit and well-being of all its citizens, set in the near- or far-[[future]], as advanced science and technology will allow these ideal living standards to exist; for example, [[post-scarcity]], [[Trans-human|transformations in human nature]], the avoidance or prevention of suffering and even the [[immortality|end of death]].

Technological utopianism is often connected with other discourses presenting technologies as agents of social and cultural change, such as [[technological determinism]] or [[Media imaginary|media imaginaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Balbi|first2=Gabriele|date=2014-04-03|title=Media and the Imaginary in History|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|journal=Media History|volume=20|issue=2|pages=203–218|doi=10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|issn=1368-8804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a leading theorist on [[technology]] and [[cyberculture]] claims that technology gives everyone a chance to voice their own opinions, fosters individualistic thinking, and dilutes hierarchy and power structures by giving the power to the people.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the whole world is in the middle of a new Renaissance, one that is centered on technology and self-expression. However, Rushkoff makes it clear that “people don’t live their lives behind a desk with their hands on a keyboard” &lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. “Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance.” Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance. Web. 02 March 2015. http://www.rushkoff.com/articles-individual/2008/3/31/21st-century-renaissance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A tech-utopia does not disregard any problems that technology may cause,&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Howard P. Imagining Tomorrow: History, Technology and The American Future, "The Technological Utopians", Cambridge: MIT Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; but strongly believes that technology allows mankind to make social, economic, political, and cultural advancements.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 41-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Technological Utopianism views technology’s impacts as extremely positive.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several ideologies and movements, such as the [[cyberdelic]] counterculture, the [[Californian Ideology]], [[transhumanism]],&lt;ref name="Hughes 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hughes, James | title = Rediscovering Utopia | year=  2003 | url = http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx  | accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204653/http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx |archivedate = 2007-09-27 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[singularitarianism]], have emerged promoting a form of techno-utopia as a reachable goal. Cultural critic [[Imre Szeman]] argues technological utopianism is an irrational [[metanarrative|social narrative]] because there is no evidence to support it. He concludes that it shows the extent to which [[Modernity|modern]] societies place faith in [[Idea of Progress|narratives of progress and technology]] overcoming things, despite all evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"&gt;{{Cite news |title=People Generally Do Not Act on Information on the Effects of Oil on the Environment |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=17 Nov 2010 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100528150833.htm |work=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===From the 19th to mid-20th centuries===

[[Karl Marx]] believed that [[science]] and [[democracy]] were the right and left hands of what he called the move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. He argued that advances in science helped delegitimize the rule of kings and the power of the [[Christian Church]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James | title = Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8133-4198-1 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century [[Classical liberalism|liberals]], [[Socialism|socialists]], and [[Republicanism|republicans]] often embraced techno-utopianism. [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] like [[Joseph Priestley]] pursued scientific investigation while advocating democracy. [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] in the early 19th century inspired [[Communalism|communalists]] with their visions of a future scientific and [[technological evolution]] of humanity using reason. Radicals seized on [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] to validate the idea of [[social progress]]. [[Edward Bellamy]]’s [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]] in ''[[Looking Backward]]'', which inspired hundreds of socialist clubs in the late 19th century [[United States]] and a national political party, was as highly technological as Bellamy’s imagination. For Bellamy and the [[Fabian Society|Fabian Socialist]]s, socialism was to be brought about as a painless corollary of industrial development.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] saw more pain and conflict involved, but agreed about the inevitable end. [[Marxism|Marxists]] argued that the advance of technology laid the groundwork not only for the creation of a new society, with [[Mutualism (economic theory)|different property relations]], but also for the emergence of new human beings reconnected to nature and themselves. At the top of the agenda for [[Empowerment|empowered]] [[proletarian]]s was "to increase the total [[productive forces]] as rapidly as possible". The 19th and early 20th century Left, from [[Social democracy|social democrats]] to [[Communism|communists]], were focused on [[industrialization]], [[economic development]] and the promotion of reason, science, and the idea of [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Some technological utopians promoted [[eugenics]]. Holding that in studies of families, such as the [[The Jukes family|Jukes]] and [[Kallikaks]], science had proven that many traits such as criminality and alcoholism were hereditary, many advocated the sterilization of those displaying negative traits. Forcible sterilization programs were implemented in several states in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Haller, Mark ''Eugenics: Hereditarian attitudes in American thought'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H.G. Wells]] in works such as ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' promoted technological utopianism.

The horrors of the 20th century – namely fascist dictatorships and the world wars – caused many to abandon optimism. The [[Holocaust]], as [[Theodor Adorno]] underlined, seemed to shatter the ideal of [[Condorcet]] and other thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which commonly equated [[scientific progress]] with social progress.&lt;ref name="Adorno1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adorno|first=Theodor W.|title=Prisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC|accessdate=31 March 2011|date=29 March 1983|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-51025-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From late 20th and early 21st centuries===

{{quotation|The Goliath of totalitarianism will be brought down by the David of the microchip.|[[Ronald Reagan]]|[[The Guardian]], 14 June 1989}}

A movement of techno-utopianism began to flourish again in the [[dot-com company|dot-com]] culture of the 1990s, particularly in the West Coast of the United States, especially based around [[Silicon Valley]]. The [[Californian Ideology]] was a set of beliefs combining [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] attitudes from the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with techno-utopianism and support for [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economic policies. It was reflected in, reported on, and even actively promoted in the pages of ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'' magazine, which was founded in San Francisco in 1993 and served for a number years as the "bible" of its adherents.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Borsook, Paulina|authorlink = Paulina Borsook|title = Cyberselfishness|year = 1996|url = https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|accessdate = 2007-02-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125249/https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|archivedate = 2007-09-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"&gt;{{cite book|author = Borsook, Paulina|title = Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech| publisher = PublicAffairs|year = 2000|isbn = 1-891620-78-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barbrook, Richard |author2=Cameron, Andy |title = The California Ideology|year = 2000 |url = http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/theory-californianideology.html| accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of techno-utopianism reflected a belief that technological change revolutionizes human affairs, and that digital technology in particular – of which the [[Internet]] was but a modest harbinger – would increase personal freedom by freeing the individual from the rigid embrace of bureaucratic big government. "Self-empowered knowledge workers" would render traditional hierarchies redundant; digital communications would allow them to escape the modern city, an "obsolete remnant of the [[industrial age]]".&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

Similar forms of "digital utopianism" has often entered in the political messages of party and social movements that point to the [[World Wide Web|Web]] or more broadly to [[new media]] as harbingers of political and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Ballatore|first2=Andrea|date=2014-01-01|title=The web will kill them all: new media, digital utopia, and political struggle in the Italian 5-Star Movement|url=http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/36/1/105|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=105–121|doi=10.1177/0163443713511902|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents claim it transcended conventional "[[Left–right politics|right/left]]" distinctions in [[politics]] by rendering politics obsolete. However, techno-utopianism disproportionately attracted adherents from the [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian right]] end of the political spectrum. Therefore, techno-utopians often have a [[Economic liberalism|hostility toward government regulation]] and a belief in the superiority of the [[free market]] system. Prominent "[[oracles]]" of techno-utopianism included [[George Gilder]] and [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], an editor of ''Wired'' who also published several books.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

During the late 1990s dot-com boom, when the [[Dot-com bubble|speculative bubble]] gave rise to claims that an era of "permanent prosperity" had arrived, techno-utopianism flourished, typically among the small percentage of the population who were employees of Internet [[Startup company|startups]] and/or owned large quantities of high-tech stocks. With the subsequent [[Stock market crash|crash]], many of these dot-com techno-utopians had to rein in some of their beliefs in the face of the clear return of traditional economic reality.&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In the late 1990s and especially during the first decade of the 21st century, [[technorealism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] are stances that have risen among advocates of [[technological change]] as critical alternatives to techno-utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technorealism|url=http://technorealism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  Technoprogressivism Beyond Technophilia and Technophobia|    year = 2005 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2005/06/technoprogressivism-beyond.html| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, technological utopianism persists in the 21st century as a result of new technological developments and their impact on society. For example, several [[Technical journalism|technical journalists]] and social commentators, such as [[Mark Pesce]], have interpreted the [[WikiLeaks]] phenomenon and the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] in early December 2010 as a precursor to, or an incentive for, the creation of a techno-utopian [[Freedom of information laws by country|transparent society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/42148.html |title=The state, the press and a hyperdemocracy |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |author=Mark Pesce |date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyber-utopianism]], first coined by [[Evgeny Morozov]], is another manifestation of this, in particular in relation to the [[Internet]] and [[social networking]].

==Principles==
Bernard Gendron, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, defines the four principles of modern technological utopians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as follows:&lt;ref name="Gendron 1977"&gt;{{cite book|    author = Gendron, Bernard|     title = Technology and the Human Condition| publisher = St.Martin's Press|      year = 1977|        isbn = 0-312-78890-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#We are presently undergoing a ([[post-industrial]]) revolution in technology;
#In the post-industrial age, [[technological change|technological growth]] will be sustained (at least);
#In the post-industrial age, technological growth will lead to the [[post scarcity|end of economic scarcity]];
#The elimination of economic scarcity will lead to the elimination of every major [[social issues|social evil]].

Rushkoff presents us with multiple claims that surround the basic principles of Technological Utopianism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|pages=21–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Technology reflects and encourages the best aspects of human nature''', fostering “communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Technology improves our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.''' Early Internet users shared their knowledge of the Internet with others around them.
#'''Technology democratizes society.''' The expansion of access to knowledge and skills led to the connection of people and information. The broadening of freedom of expression created “the online world...in which we are allowed to voice our own opinions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of the inequalities of power and wealth meant that everyone has an equal status on the internet and is allowed to do as much as the next person.
#'''Technology inevitably progresses.''' The interactivity that came from the inventions of the TV [[remote control]], video game [[joystick]], [[computer mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] allowed for much more progress.
#'''Unforeseen impacts of technology are positive.''' As more people discovered the Internet, they took advantage of being linked to millions of people, and turned the Internet into a social revolution. The government released it to the public, and its “social side effect… [became] its main feature.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
#'''Technology increases efficiency and consumer choice.''' The creation of the TV remote, video game joystick, and computer mouse liberated these technologies and allowed users to manipulate and control them, giving them many more choices.
#'''New technology can solve the problems created by old technology.''' Social networks and blogs were created out of the collapse of [[dot.com bubble]] businesses’ attempts to run pyramid schemes on users.

==Criticisms==

Critics claim that techno-utopianism's identification of [[social progress]] with [[scientific progress]] is a form of [[positivism]] and [[scientism]]. Critics of modern libertarian techno-utopianism point out that it tends to focus on "government interference" while dismissing the positive effects of the [[regulation]] of [[business]]. They also point out that it has little to say about the [[Technology#Environmental|environmental impact of technology]]&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and that its ideas have little relevance for much of the rest of the world that are still relatively quite poor (see [[global digital divide]]).&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In his 2010 study ''System Failure: Oil, Futurity, and the Anticipation of Disaster'', [[Canada Research Chair]]holder in cultural studies Imre Szeman argues that technological utopianism is one of the social narratives that prevent people from acting on the knowledge they have concerning the [[environmental issues with petroleum|effects of oil on the environment]].&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"/&gt;

In a controversial article "Techno-Utopians are Mugged by Reality", [[Wall Street Journal]] explores the concept of the violation of free speech by shutting down social media to stop violence. As a result of British cities being looted consecutively, Prime British Minister David Cameron argued that the government should have the ability to shut down social media during crime sprees so that the situation could be contained. A poll was conducted to see if Twitter users would prefer to let the service be closed temporarily or keep it open so they can chat about the famous television show X-Factor. The end report showed that every Tweet opted for X-Factor. The negative social effects of technological utopia is that society is so addicted to technology that we simply can't be parted even for the greater good. While many Techno-Utopians would like to believe that digital technology is for the greater good, it can also be used negatively to bring harm to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903918104576506393735675856.html#articleTabs%3Darticle|title= Techno-Utopians Are Mugged by Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of a techno-utopia include the worry of the human element. Critics suggest that a techno-utopia may lessen human contact, leading to a distant society. Another concern is the amount of reliance society may place on their technologies in these techno-utopia settings.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], ”Technological Dependency and Loss of Freedom”, pp. 245, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are sometimes referred to as a technological anti-utopian view or a techno-dystopia.

Even today, the negative social effects of a technological utopia can be seen. Mediated communication such as phone calls, instant messaging and text messaging are steps towards a utopian world in which one can easily contact another regardless of time or location. However, mediated communication removes many aspects that are helpful in transferring messages. As it stands today, most text, email, and instant messages offer fewer nonverbal cues about the speaker’s feelings than do face-to-face encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler &amp; Proctor II|first=Ronald B. &amp; Russell F.|title=Looking Out Looking In|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cenage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-495-79621-3|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it so that mediated communication can easily be misconstrued and the intended message is not properly conveyed. With the absence of tone, body language, and environmental context, the chance of a misunderstanding is much higher, rendering the communication ineffective. In fact, mediated technology can be seen from a dystopian view because it can be detrimental to effective interpersonal communication.  These criticisms would only apply to messages that are prone to misinterpretation as not every text based communication requires contextual cues.  The limitations of lacking tone and body language in text based communication are likely to be mitigated by [[videotelephony|video]] and [[augmented reality]] versions of digital communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-communication/article/augmented-reality-in-technical-communication/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''theory of operation''' is a description of how a [[tool|device]] or [[system]] should work.  It is often included in [[documentation]], especially [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance/service]] documentation, or a [[user manual]].  It aids [[troubleshooting]] by providing the troubleshooter with a [[mental model]] of how the system is supposed to work.  The troubleshooter can then more easily identify discrepancies, to aid [[diagnosis]] of problem.

'''Timeline of Russian Innovation''' encompasses key events in the [[history of technology]] in [[Russia]], starting from the [[Early East Slavs]] and up to the [[Russian Federation]].

The entries in this timeline fall into the following categories:

* Indigenous inventions, like [[airliner]]s, [[AC transformer]]s, [[radio receiver]]s, [[television]], artificial [[satellite]]s, [[ICBM]]s
* Products and objects that are uniquely Russian, like [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Matryoshka doll]]s, [[Russian vodka]]
* Products and objects with superlative characteristics, like the [[Tsar Bomba]], the [[AK-47]], and [[Typhoon class submarine]]
* Scientific and medical discoveries, like the [[periodic law]], [[vitamins]] and [[stem cells]]

This timeline examines scientific and medical discoveries, products and technologies introduced by various peoples of Russia and its predecessor states, regardless of ethnicity, and also lists inventions by naturalized immigrant citizens.

;[[Baked milk]] / [[Ryazhenka]]
: Baked milk is made by [[simmering]] milk on low heat for eight hours or longer. The product has a light brown color, a specific taste and the ability to be stored safely at room temperature for up to forty hours, much longer than most milk-based beverages. It has been produced since ancient times, typically using a [[Russian oven]]. Nowadays it is produced on an industrial scale. Soured or fermented baked milk, traditionally known as '''ryazhenka''', is especially popular in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Randall Mack, Asele Surina. ''Food Culture In Russia And Central Asia''.

: A banya is a traditional Russian wet [[steam bath]], where bathing takes place inside special rooms or stand-alone wooden houses, with steam being produced by splashing water upon a heated furnace. Historically, the banya developed simultaneously with its closest relative, the [[Finnish sauna]]. However, modern saunas converted to dry steam, while banyas continue to use wet steam.{{clarify|reason="Dry steam"?

It is customary to cool off outdoors or splash around in cold water, or even in a lake or river. In the winter, people may roll in the snow or jump into the water through holes in the ice.

: An izba is a traditional Russian countryside dwelling, a type of [[log house]], suited to the colder climate of North-Eastern Europe and Siberia. Traditional, old-style izba construction involved the use of simple tools, such as ropes, axes, knives, and spades. Nails were not generally used, as metal was relatively expensive, and neither were saws. Both the interior and exterior were made of split tree trunks, the gap between was usually filled with clay from a riverbed. From the 15th century on, the central element of the interior of an izba was the [[Russian oven]]. Outside izbas were often embellished by various special architectural features, for example rich wood carving decorations on windows.

==Kievan Rus'==

;Architecture
:The earliest Kievan churches were built and decorated with frescoes and mosaics by Byzantine masters. The great churches of Kievan Rus', built after the adoption of Christianity in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. Early Eastern Orthodox churches were mainly made of wood, while major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes. The 10th-century Church of the Tithes in Kiev was the first to be made of stone.[[File:Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia in Russian dress by anonim (1790s, Gatchina).jpg|thumb|A Russian girl wearing [[kokoshnik]] and [[sarafan]].]]

It is tied at the back of the head with long thick ribbons in a large bow. The forehead is sometimes decorated with pearls or other jewelry. The word ''kokoshnik'' appeared in the 16th century, however the earliest head-dress pieces of a similar type were found in the 10th to 12th century burials in [[Veliky Novgorod]]. It was worn by girls and women on special occasions until the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], and was subsequently introduced into Western [[fashion]] by Russian [[émigré]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larussie.narod.ru/odezhda/od06_01.htm Primeval Rus': Women's head dress and jewellery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120155727/http://larussie.narod.ru/odezhda/od06_01.htm |date=2010-11-20 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Kvass'' or ''kvas'', sometimes called in English a "bread drink", is a [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] beverage made from black [[rye]] or rye [[bread]], which contributes to its light or dark colour. By the content of [[alcohol]] resulted from fermentation, it is classified as non-alcoholic: up to 1.2% of alcohol, which is so low that it is considered acceptable for consumption by children. While the early low-alcoholic prototypes of kvass were known in some ancient civilizations, its modern, almost non-alcoholic form originated in [[Eastern Europe]]. Kvass was first mentioned in the Russian [[Primary Chronicle]], which tells how Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] gave kvass among other beverages to the people, while celebrating the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']].

: The '''multidomed church''' is a typical form of Russian church architecture, which distinguishes Russia from other Orthodox nations and Christian denominations. Indeed, the earliest Russian churches built just after the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], were multi-domed, which led some historians to speculate what Russian pre-Christian pagan temples might have looked like. Namely, these early churches were 13-domed wooden [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (989) and 25-domed stone [[Desyatinnaya Church]] in [[Kiev]] (989–996). The number of domes typically has a symbolical meaning in [[Russian architecture]], for example 13 domes symbolize [[Christ]] with 12 [[Apostles]], while 25 domes mean the same with additional 12 Prophets from the [[Old Testament]]. Multiple domes of Russian churches were often made of wood and were comparatively smaller than the [[Byzantine]] domes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangelove.net/~kieser/Russia/churches.html Russian Church Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701204844/http://www.strangelove.net/~kieser/Russia/churches.html |date=2012-07-01 }} by Lisa Kies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypalace.org/europe/slavic/east_slavic/russia/articles/domes.shtml About Russian Domes and Cupolas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025931/http://www.skypalace.org/europe/slavic/east_slavic/russia/articles/domes.shtml |date=2011-07-28 }} at Sky Palace world architecture site.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Red Currant Kissel.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ribes rubrum|Red currant]] [[kissel]].]]

;[[Birch bark document]]
: A birch bark document is a document written on pieces of [[birch bark]]. This form of writing material was developed independently by several ancient cultures. In Rus' the usage of the specially prepared birch bark as a cheap replacement for [[Parchment|pergament]] or [[paper]] became widespread soon after the [[Christianization of Rus'|Christianization]] of the country. The earliest Russian birch bark documents (likely written in the first quarter of the 11th century) have been found in [[Veliky Novgorod]]. In total, more than 1000 such documents have been discovered, most of them in Novgorod and the rest in other ancient cities in [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. Many birch bark documents were written by common people rather than by clergy or nobility. This fact led some historians to suggest that before the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']] the level of [[literacy]] in the country might have been considerably higher than in contemporary [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gramoty.ru/ Online library of 956 Russian birch bark documents and modern translations] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223205324/http://gramoty.ru/ |date=2011-02-23 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Krsk koch.JPG|thumb|right|A 17th-century [[Koch (boat)|koch]] in a museum in [[Krasnoyarsk]]]]

The koch was developed by the [[Russia]]n [[Pomors]] in the 11th century, when they started settling on the [[White Sea]] shores. The koch's hull was protected by a belt of ice-floe resistant flush skin-planking (made of [[oak]] or [[larch]]) along the variable water-line, and had a false keel for on-ice [[portage]]. If a koch was in danger of being trapped in the ice-fields, its rounded bodylines below the surface would allow for the ship to be pushed up out of the water and onto the ice with no damage.

: ''Pelmeni'' is a dish originating from [[Siberia]], now considered part of [[Russia]]n national cuisine. It is a type of [[dumpling]] consisting of a filling that is wrapped in thin unleavened [[dough]]. The word ''pelmeni'' comes from the Finno-Ugric [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]], and [[Mansi language|Mansi]] languages. It is unclear when pelmeni entered the cuisines of [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|indigenous Siberian people]] and when it first appeared in [[Russian cuisine]], but most likely it was during the [[Mongol conquests]] and [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol-Tatar invasion of Rus']] in the 13th century, when [[Mongol-Tatars]] took the basic idea from the [[China|Chinese]] [[dumpling]]s and brought it to [[Siberia]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sras.org/pelmeni_history Pelmeni.

'''[[Lapta (game)|Lapta]]'''
* '''Lapta''' is a [[Russia]]n [[ball game]] played with a [[Baseball bat|bat]], similar to modern [[baseball]]. The game is played outside on a field the size of 20 x 25 [[sazhen]]s (about 140 x 175 feet). Points are earned by hitting the ball, served by a player of the opposite team, and sending it as far as possible, then running across the field to the ''kon'' line, and if possible running back to the ''gorod'' line. The running player should try to avoid being hit with the ball, which is thrown by opposing team members. The most ancient balls and bats for lapta were found in 14th-century layers during excavations in [[Novgorod]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=11394 No Wrong Way to Swing Bat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315032757/http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=11394 |date=2009-03-15 }} at the site of [[The St. Petersburg Times]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* A '''zvonnitsa''' is a large rectangular structure containing multiple [[arch]]es or [[beam (structure)|beam]]s that carry [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s, where [[bell ringer]]s stand on its basement level and perform the ringing using long ropes, like playing on a kind of giant [[musical instrument]]. It was an alternative to [[bell tower]] in the medieval architecture of [[Russia]] and some [[Eastern Europe]]an countries. Zvonnitsa appeared in Russia in the 14th century and was widely used until the 17th century. Sometimes it was mounted right atop the [[church (building)|church]] building, resulting in the special type of church called ''pod zvonom'' ("under ringing") or ''izhe pod kolokoly'' ("under bells"). The most famous example of this type of a church is the Church of [[John Climacus|St. Ivan of the Ladder]] adjacent to the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oval.ru/enc/27444.html Zvonnitsa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221452/http://www.oval.ru/enc/27444.html |date=2011-09-27 }} in the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hramy.ru/rare/podzvon.htm Churches Under Bells] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526180256/http://www.hramy.ru/rare/podzvon.htm |date=2010-05-26 }} at the site hramy.ru (Churches of Russia) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Old Permic script|Anbur script]]''' The alphabet was introduced by a Russian missionary, Stepan Khrap, also known as Saint Stephen of Perm (Степан Храп, св. Стефан Пермский) in 1372. The name Abur is derived from the names of the first two characters: An and Bur. The alphabet derived from Cyrillic and Greek, and Komi tribal signs, the latter being similar in the appearance to runes or siglas poveiras, because they were created by incisions, rather than by usual writing. The alphabet was in use until the 17th century, when it was superseded by the Cyrillic script. Abur was also used as cryptographic writing for the Russian language.

'''1376 [[Sarafan]]'''
* The '''sarafan''' is a long, shapeless [[pinafore]]-type [[jumper dress]], a part of the traditional [[Russia]]n folk costume worn by women and girls. Sarafans could be of single piece construction with thin shoulder straps over which a [[corset]] is sometimes worn, giving the shape of the body of a smaller [[triangle]] over a larger one. It comes in different styles such as the simpler black, flower- or check-patterned versions formerly used for everyday wear, or elaborate brocade versions formerly reserved for special occasions. Chronicles first mention it in the year 1376, and since that time it was worn well until the 20th century. It is now worn as a [[folk culture|folk]] costume for performing Russian folk songs and [[folk dancing]]. Plain sarafans are still designed and worn today as a summer-time light dress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120727001629/http://www.aerotranslate.com/russian-culture/what-is-a-traditional-russian-sarafan.html What Is a Traditional Russian Sarafan?] at aerotranslate.com {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linorusso.ru/article.php?parent_id=8 Russian sarafan] at linorusso.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''bardiche''' was a long poleaxe, that is a type of weapon combining the features of an [[axe]] and a [[polearm]], known primarily in [[Eastern Europe]] where it was used instead of [[halberd]]s. Occasionally such weapons were made in [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] and [[Early Middle Ages]], but the regular and widespread usage of bardiches started in early-15th-century Russia. It was probably developed from the [[Scandinavia]]n [[broad axe]], but in Scandinavia it appeared only in the late 15th century. In the 16th century the bardiche became a weapon associated with the [[streltsy]], Russian guardsmen armed with [[firearms]], who used bardiches to rest handguns upon when firing.&lt;ref&gt;Кирпичников А.

* The '''boyar hat''', also known as '''gorlatnaya hat''', was a [[fur]] hat worn by Russian nobility between the 15th and 17th centuries, most notably by [[boyar]]s, for whom it was a sign of their social status. The higher hat indicated higher status. In average, it was one [[ell]] in height, having the form of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] with more broad upper part, [[velvet]] or [[brocade]] on top and a main body made of [[fox]], [[marten]] or [[sable]] fur.

'''[[Gulyay-gorod]]'''
* The '''gulyay-gorod''' (literally "wandering town") was a mobile fortification made from large wall-sized prefabricated shields set on [[wagon]]s or [[sled]]s, a development of the [[wagon fort]] concept. The usage of installable shields instead of permanently armoured wagons was cheaper and allowed more possible configurations to be assembled. Such mobile structures were used mostly in the open [[steppe]], where few natural shelters could be found. The wide-scale usage of gulyay-gorod started during the [[Russo-Kazan Wars]], and later it was often used by the [[Ukrainian Cossacks]].&lt;ref&gt;V.F.Shperk, "The History of Fortification" (В. Ф.

'''[[Ukha]]'''
* '''Ukha''' is a Russian soup, made with [[broth]] and fish like [[salmon]] or [[cod]], [[root vegetables]], parsley root, [[leek]], [[potato]], bay leaf, [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[dill]], green [[parsley]] and spiced with black pepper, cinnamon and cloves. Fish like [[perch]], [[tench]]es, [[Silurus glanis|sheatfish]] and [[burbot]] were used to add flavour to the soup. ''Ukha'' as a name in the [[Russian cuisine]] for fish broth was established only in the late 17th to early 18th centuries. In earlier times this name was first given to thick meat broths, and then later chicken. Beginning from the 15th century, fish was used more and more often to prepare ukha, thus creating a dish that had a distinctive taste among soups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulinarnie-recepty.ru/uha/ Ukha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424003110/http://www.kulinarnie-recepty.ru/uha/ |date=2010-04-24 }} at kulinarnie-recepty.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Russian oven]]'''
[[File:Belarus-SMFAL-Stove.jpg|thumb|Typical [[Russian oven]] in a peasant [[izba]].]]
* The '''Russian oven''' or '''Russian stove''' is a unique type of [[oven]]/[[furnace]] that first appeared in the early 15th century. The Russian oven is usually placed in the centre of the [[izba]], a traditional Russian dwelling, and plays an immense role in the traditional [[Russian culture]] and way of life. It is used both for cooking and domestic heating and is designed to retain heat for long periods of time. This is achieved by channeling the smoke and hot air produced by combustion through a complex labyrinth of passages, warming the bricks from which the oven is constructed. In winter people may sleep on top of the oven to keep warm. As well as warming and cooking, the Russian oven can be used for washing. A grown man can easily fit inside, and during the [[Great Patriotic War]] some people escaped the Nazis by hiding in ovens. Porridge or pancakes prepared in such an oven may differ in taste from the same meal prepared on a modern stove or range. The process of cooking in a traditional Russian oven can be called "languor" - holding dishes for a long period of time at a steady temperature. Foods that are believed to acquire a distinctive character from being prepared in a Russian oven include [[baked milk]], [[pearl barley]], [[mushroom]]s cooked in [[Smetana (dairy product)|sour cream]], or even a simple potato.&lt;ref&gt;[http://n-t.ru/nj/nz/1988/0107.htm Russian oven in the 20th century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508213816/http://n-t.ru/nj/nz/1988/0107.htm |date=2009-05-08 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pechka.su/ Russian oven] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913230300/http://www.pechka.su/ |date=2008-09-13 }} at pechka.su {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''c. 1430 [[Vodka#Russia|Russian vodka]]'''
* '''Russian vodka''' is perhaps the world's most famous national brand of [[vodka]], that is a [[distillation|distilled]] [[liquor]], composed solely of [[water]] and [[ethanol]] with possible traces of impurities and flavorings. Vodka is one of the world's most popular liquors. It is made by [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of [[rye]], [[wheat]], [[potato]]es, grapes, or [[sugar beet]] [[molasses]]. Alcoholic content usually ranges between 35 and 50 percent by [[volume]]. The standard Russian vodka is 40 percent alcohol by volume (80 [[alcoholic proof|proof]]). The exact origins of vodka cannot be traced definitively, but almost certainly vodka as a beverage comes from 14th–15th-century [[Eastern Europe]]. Russia is often named the birthplace of vodka. The [[distillation apparatus]] was known in [[Moscow]] from the late 14th century and was used to produce [[Distilled beverage|spirit]], the precursor of vodka. According to Russian food historian [[William Pokhlyobkin]], the first original recipe of Russian vodka was produced around 1430 by a monk called [[Isidore (inventor)|Isidore]] from [[Chudov Monastery]] inside the [[Moscow Kremlin]].&lt;ref name="pohlebkin_history"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Pokhlebkin|Pokhlebkin V.

* The '''kokoshnik''' is a semicircular or keel-like exterior decorative element in the traditional [[Russian architecture]], a type of [[corbel]] [[blind arch]]. The name was inspired by the [[Kokoshnik|traditional Russian women's head-dress]]. Kokoshniks were used in Russian church architecture in the 16th century, while in the 17th century their popularity reached the highest point. Kokoshniks were placed on walls, at the basement of [[tented roof]]s or [[tholobate]]s, or over the window frames, or in rows above the [[vault (architecture)|vaults]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article062648.html Kokoshnik (architecture)] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100425120514/http://bse.sci-lib.com/article062648.html |date=2010-04-25 }} in the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1510s [[Tented roof|Tented roof masonry]]'''
* The '''tented roof masonry''' was a technique widely used in the [[Russian architecture]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Before that time [[tented roof]]s ([[cone (geometry)|conical]], or actually [[polygonal]] roofs) were made of wood and used in the wooden churches. These hipped roofs are thought to have originated in the Russian North, as they prevented snow from piling up on wooden buildings during long winters. Wooden tents also were used to cover [[tower]]s in [[kremlin]]s, or even applied in some common buildings, like it was in [[Western Europe]], but the thin, pointed, nearly conical roofs of the similar shape made of [[brick]] or [[stone]] became a unique form in Russian church architecture. Some scholars, however, argue that hipped roofs have something in common with European [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[spire]]s, and even tend to call this style 'Russian Gothic'. The Ascension church of [[Kolomenskoye]], built in 1532 to commemorate the birth of the first Russian [[Tsar]] [[Ivan IV]], is often considered the first tented roof church, but recent studies show that the earliest use of the stone tented roof was in the Trinity Church in [[Alexandrov (town)|Alexandrov]], built in the 1510s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214934/http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm |date=2013-01-16 }} by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed in Russia from the late 16th century, at the time when abacus already was falling out of use in the [[Western Europe]]. However, the decimality of the Russian abacus (explained by [[Russian ruble]]'s being the world's first [[decimal currency]]) and its simplicity (compared to the previous European and Asian versions) led to the wide use of this device in Russia well until the advent of [[electronic calculator]]s in the late 20th century, though it remains in quite common use today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ergosolo.ru/reviews/history/schety/ Russian Abacus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127065619/http://ergosolo.ru/reviews/history/schety/ |date=2010-11-27 }} at ergosolo.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1561 ''[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]]'' '''

It was designed by [[Postnik Yakovlev]] on the order of [[Ivan IV of Russia]] and built on the Moscow's [[Red Square]] in 1555–1561, to commemorate the [[Siege of Kazan (1552)|capture of Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan]]. The unique feature of the Saint Basil's Cathedral is the fact that it is a complex of multiple temples put together. The original building, known as "Trinity Cathedral", contained eight side churches covered with [[onion dome]]s and arranged around the ninth, central [[tented roof]] church of [[Intercession of saints|Intercession]]; the tenth church was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local [[Foolishness for Christ|Fool]] [[Basil Fool for Christ|Vasily (Basil)]]. In the 16th and the 17th centuries the cathedral, perceived as the earthly symbol of the [[Heaven#In Orthodox Christianity|Heavenly City]], was popularly known as "[[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]" and served as an [[allegory]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]] in the annual [[Palm Sunday]] parade attended by the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] and the [[Tsar]]. Its striking design, shaped as a flame of a bonfire rising into the sky, has no analogues elsewhere in the world, and it was seldom reproduced in [[Russian architecture]], most notably in the St. Peter's and Paul Cathedral in [[Petergof]] and in the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] in [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Landmarks of Russian Architecture: A Photographic Survey | author=[[William Craft Brumfield|Brumfield, William Craft]] | publisher=Routledge | year=1997 | isbn=978-90-5699-537-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNfoyvTB04sC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Brunov, N.

* The '''Great Abatis Line''', or '''Bolshaya Zasechnaya Cherta''' in Russian, was the largest fortification line of the [[abatis]] type, built by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Its purpose was to protect Russia from the raids of [[nomad]]s of the [[Eastern Europe]]an steppes, such as the [[Crimean Tatars]]. As a fortification construction stretching for hundreds kilometers, the Great Abatis Line is analogous to the [[Great Wall of China]] and the Roman [[Limes]]. Most of its length consisted of [[abatis]], which is a barrier built from felled trees arranged as a barricade. It was also fortified by ditches and earth mounds, palisades, watch towers and natural features like lakes and swamps. Stone and wooden [[kremlin]]s of the towns were also included in the Great Abatis Line, as well as the smaller forts called [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]s. The Great Abatis Line was built south of [[Moscow]] between the [[Bryansk]] woods and [[Meschera]] swamps starting from the 12th century, and was officially completed in 1566, exceeding 1000&amp;nbsp;km in length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/044/168.htm Abatis Lines] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050507182307/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/044/168.htm |date=2005-05-07 }} with maps at cultinfo.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skittles, or pins, are called ''gorodki'' (literally ''little cities'' or ''townlets''), and the square zone in which they are arranged is called the ''gorod'' (''city''). The game is mentioned in the old Russian chronicles and was known in the form close to the modern one at least from the 17th century, since one of the famous players in gorodki was the young [[Peter I of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorodki.org/IFGS/about/history.htm The history of gorodki] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120215825/http://www.gorodki.org/IFGS/about/history.htm |date=2009-11-20 }} at gorodki.org {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Roller coaster]]'''
* '''Russian Mountains''' were winter sled rides held on specially constructed hills of ice, sometimes up to 200 feet tall, being the first type of [[roller coaster]]. Known from the 17th century, the slides were built to a height of between 70 and 80 feet, consisted of a 50 degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports. In the 18th century they were especially popular in [[St. Petersburg]] and surrounding areas, from where by the late 18th century their usage and popularity spread to Europe. Sometimes wheeled carts were used instead of tracks, like in the ''Katalnaya Gorka'' built in [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s residence in [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]]. The first such wheeled ride was brought to [[Paris]] in 1804 under the name ''Les Montagnes Russes'' (French for "Russian Mountains"), and the term ''Russian Mountains'' continues to be a synonym for ''roller coaster'' in many countries today.&lt;ref&gt;Roller Coasters A Thrill Seeker's Guide to the Ultimate Scream Machines pg 14 (1st Published Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Bird of Happiness (toy)|Bird of Happiness]]'''
* The '''Bird of Happiness''' is the traditional North Russian wooden [[toy]], carved in the shape of a bird. It was invented by [[Pomors]], the inhabitants of the [[White Sea|White]] and [[Barents Sea]] coastline. The Bird of Happiness is made without glue or other fasteners, by elaborate carving of thin petals for the bird’s wings and tail and then using a special method of spreading and curving them. Similar methods are also used in other products of the North Russian handicraft. The amulet is usually made of pine, fir, spruce, or [[Siberia]]n cedar. It is suspended inside a house, guarding the family hearth and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russia-ic.com/culture_art/visual_arts/953/|title=Bird of Happiness: Wooden Guardian of Family Hearth :: Visual Arts :: Culture &amp; Arts :: Russia-InfoCentre|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322074554/http://russia-ic.com/culture_art/visual_arts/953/|archivedate=22 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Dymkovo toys''', also known as the '''Vyatka toys''' or '''Kirov toys''' are moulded painted [[clay]] figures of people and animals (sometimes in the form of a [[Tin whistle|pennywhistle]]). It is an old [[Russia]]n folk [[handicraft]] which still exists in a village of Dymkovo near [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]] (former Vyatka). Traditionally, the Dymkovo toys are made by women. Up until the 20th century, this toy production had been timed to the spring fair called ''свистунья'' (svistunya), or whistler. The first recorded mention of this event took place in 1811, however it is believed to have existed for some 400 years, thus dating the history of Dymkovo toy at least from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Vyatka Land.

'''[[Troika (driving)|Troika]]'''
* The '''troika''' (тройка, "triplet" or "trio") is a traditional Russian [[horse driving|harness driving]] combination, using three [[horse]]s abreast, usually pulling a [[sleigh]]. It differs from most other three-horse combinations in that the horses are harnessed abreast. In addition to that, the troika is the world's only multiple harness with different [[horse gait]]s – the middle horse [[trot (horse gait)|trot]]s and the side horses [[canter]]. At full speed a troika could reach {{Convert|45|-|50|km/h|mph}}, which was a very high speed on land for vehicles in the 17th-19th centuries, making the troika closely associated with the fast ride. The troika was developed from the late 17th century, first being used for speedy delivering of [[mail]], and having become common by the late 18th century. It was often used for travelling in stages where teams of tired horses could be exchanged for fresh animals to transport loads and people over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zooclub.ru/horses/8.shtml Russian troika] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130215338/http://zooclub.ru/horses/8.shtml |date=2010-11-30 }} at zooclub.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://damascus.ru/index.php?cPath=56_312_314 Jingle bells] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100522103941/http://damascus.ru/index.php?cPath=56_312_314 |date=2010-05-22 }} at damascus.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1979 CPA 4968.jpg|thumb|[[Khokhloma]] tableware on a Soviet postage stamp.]]
* '''Khokhloma''' is the name of a Russian wood painting [[handicraft]], known for its vivid flower patterns, [[red]] and [[gold (color)|gold]] colors over the black background, and the distinctive effect on the cheap and light wooden tableware or furniture, making it look heavier, [[metal]]-like and glamorous. It first appeared in the second half of the 17th century, at least from 1659, in today's [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] and was named after the large trade settlement Khokhloma. The handicraft owes its origin to the [[Old Believers]], who, fleeing from persecutions of officials, took refuge in local woods and taught some of the [[icon painting]] techniques to the local craftsmen, such as the usage of a goldish color without applying real [[gold]]. Nowadays khokhloma is one of the symbols of Russia, and apart from its usage in making tableware, furniture and [[souvenir]]s, it can be found in the wider context, for example in paintings on Russian [[airliner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuartking.co.uk/index.php/khokhloma-ware-folk-art-for-the-masses/|title=Khokhloma Ware: Folk art for the masses|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609105356/http://www.stuartking.co.uk/index.php/khokhloma-ware-folk-art-for-the-masses/|archivedate=9 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1679 [[Circle of fifths]]'''
*In the late 1670s a [[treatise]] called ''Grammatika'' was written by the composer and theorist [[Nikolai Diletskii]]. Diletskii’s ''Grammatika'' is a treatise on composition, the first of its kind, which targeted Western-style polyphonic compositions. It taught how to write kontserty, [[polyphonic]] [[a cappella]], which were normally based on [[liturgical]] texts and were created by putting together musical sections that have contrasting [[rhythm]], meters, [[melodic]] material and [[vocal]] groupings. Diletskii intended his treatise to be a guide to composition but pertaining to the rules of [[music theory]].

* The '''balalaika''' is a [[stringed instrument]] with a characteristic [[triangle|triangular]] body and 3 strings (or sometimes 6, in 3 courses), perhaps the best-known national Russian musical instrument. The balalaika family of instruments includes, from the highest-pitched to the lowest, the prima balalaika, sekunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass balalaika and contrabass balalaika. The earliest mention of balalaika is found in a 1688 document, and initially it was an instrument of [[skomorokh]]s (sort of Russian free-lance musical jesters). In the 1880s the modern standard balalika was developed by [[Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev|Vasily Andreev]], who also started a tradition of balalaika orchestras, which finally led to the popularity of the instrument in many countries outside Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skaz1.com/balalaika.html Balalaika] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426081608/http://skaz1.com/balalaika.html |date=2009-04-26 }} by Dmitry Belinskiy, from the newspaper ''Krymskaya Pravda''. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Glass-holder]]''' 
*The podstakannik (Russian: подстаканник, literally "thing under the glass"), or tea glass holder, is a holder with a handle, most commonly made of metal, that holds a drinking glass. The primary purpose of podstakanniki (pl.) is to hold a very hot glass of tea, which is usually consumed right after it is brewed. It is a traditional way of serving and drinking tea in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other post-Soviet states.

'''[[Table-glass]]'''
* The '''table-glass''' or '''granyonyi stakan''' (literally ''faceted glass'') is a type of [[drinkware]] made from especially hard and thick [[glass]], having a faceted form. Granyonyi stakan has certain advantages over the other drinkware, since due to its form and hardness it is more difficult to break. It is arguably handier in usage on moving trains or rolling ships, where it is less prone to tip and fall, or slip from hands, and less likely to break upon hitting the floor. A legend says that the first known Russian faceted glass was given as a present to [[Tsar]] [[Peter the Great]] from a glass-maker called [[Yefim Smolin]], living in [[Vladimir Oblast]]. He boasted to Tsar that his glass couldn't be broken. Tsar Peter liked the present, however, after drinking some alcoholic beverage from it, he threw the glass on the ground and managed to break it. Still Peter didn't punish the glass-maker, and the production of such glasses continued, while the Russian tradition of breaking [[drinkware]] on certain occasions originated from that episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hronograf.narod.ru/10/stakan.htm The Day of Granenyi Stakan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120181632/http://hronograf.narod.ru/10/stakan.htm |date=2010-11-20 }} at hronograf.narod.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''decimal currency''' is a type of [[currency]] that is based on one basic unit and a sub-unit which is a power of [[10 (number)|10]], typically 100. Most modern currencies adhere to this pattern. Russia was the first country to introduce such a currency after [[decimalisation]] of its financial system in 1704, during the reign of [[Peter the Great]], when [[Russian ruble]] was made equal to 100 [[Ruble|kopecks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://law-theory.ru/show/istoriya_otechestvennogo_rublya_i_kopejki_chast._4.html The history of Russian ruble and copeck] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819210658/http://law-theory.ru/show/istoriya_otechestvennogo_rublya_i_kopejki_chast._4.html |date=2011-08-19 }}, part 4 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''yacht club''' is a sports [[Club (organization)|club]] specifically related to [[sailing]] and [[yachting]]. The oldest yacht club in the world, by date of establishment, is the [[Neva Yacht Club]], founded by the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Peter the Great]] in 1718 in [[St. Petersburg]] (likely, the idea had been devised as early as 1716, when the First Neva Shipyard started building civilian vessels). Though, since it was not a purely voluntary association of members, but an organisation founded by Tsar's decree, the Neva Yacht Club's being the world's oldest is challenged by the [[Royal Cork Yacht Club]] in [[Ireland]], founded in 1720.

'''1725 [[Rebar]]'''
* '''Rebar''' or '''reinforcing bar''' is a common metal bar (typically made of [[steel]]), used in [[reinforced concrete]] and reinforced [[masonry]] structures. Rebar was known in construction well before the era of the modern [[reinforced concrete]], since some 150 years before its invention rebar were used in the [[Leaning Tower of Nevyansk]] in [[Russia]], which was built on the orders of the [[industrialist]] [[Akinfiy Demidov]] between 1725-1732. The purpose of such construction is one of the many mysteries of the tower. The [[cast iron]] used was of very high quality, and there is no [[corrosion]] on them up to this day.&lt;ref name="nevyansk"&gt;[http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2002/42/102260.html The office of the first Russian oligarch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208181611/http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2002/42/102260.html |date=2010-02-08 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1732 [[Cast iron]] [[cupola]] / [[Lightning rod]] '''
* The '''cast iron cupola''' was a type of [[cupola]] made of [[cast iron]] rather than made from [[stone]] or [[brick]] as it was in ancient or medieval domes. The first application of this technology is found in the mysterious [[Leaning Tower of Nevyansk]], completed in 1732. The tower's [[tented roof]] had a [[cast iron]] carcass and outer shell. The second time, this technique was applied only some 100 years later, during the reconstruction of the [[Mainz Cathedral]] in [[Germany]] in 1826, while the third time it was used in the [[dome]] of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[St. Petersburg]], built in the 1840s. The very top of the tower was crowned with a [[gilding|gild]]ed metallic [[sphere]] with spikes. Since it was [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] through the [[rebar]] of the tower carcass, it acted like a '''lightning rod'''. Thus, the Russian builders de facto created the first lightning rod in the Western world some 25&amp;nbsp;years before [[Benjamin Franklin]], however it is not known whether that was intentional.&lt;ref name="nevyansk"/&gt;

* The '''Peter and Paul Cathedral''' is a [[Russian Orthodox]] cathedral located in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. It is the first and oldest landmark in St. Petersburg, built between 1712 and 1733 inside the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]. Both the cathedral and the fortress were originally built under [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and designed by [[Domenico Trezzini]]. The cathedral is the burial place of all [[Russian Emperor]]s from [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] to [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], with the exception of [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. The cathedral's bell tower is the world's [[List of tallest Orthodox churches|tallest Orthodox bell tower]].

'''1735 ''[[Tsar Bell]]'' '''
* The '''Tsar Bell''', also known as the '''Tsarsky Kolokol''' or '''Royal Bell''', is a huge [[bell (instrument)|bell]] on display on the grounds of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. The bell was commissioned by [[Empress Anna]], niece of [[Peter the Great]]. Currently it is the [[List of heaviest bells|largest and heaviest bell]] in the world, weighing 216 [[ton]]s, with a height of 6.14&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] (20.1&amp;nbsp;ft) and diameter of 6.6&amp;nbsp;m (21.6&amp;nbsp;ft). It was [[foundry|founded]] from [[bronze]] by masters [[Ivan Motorin]] and his son Mikhail in 1733–1735. The bell, however, was never rung because of a fire in 1737, when a huge slab (11.5 tons) cracked off while it was still in the casting pit. In 1836, the bell was placed on a stone [[pedestal]] next to the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]]. For a time, the bell served as a [[chapel]], with the broken area forming the door. According to the legend, on [[Last Judgment|Judgement Day]] the Tsar Bell will be miraculously repaired and lifted up to heaven, where it will ring the [[blagovest]] (call to prayer).&lt;ref name="portnov"/&gt;

* The '''Amber Room''' in the [[Catherine Palace]] of [[Tsarskoye Selo]] near [[Saint Petersburg]] is a complete chamber decoration of [[amber (color)|amber]] panels backed with [[gold leaf]] and [[mirror]]s. It was dubbed the ''[[Eighth Wonder of the World]]'' due to its singular beauty and the large quantity of a rare material (amber is rather hard to carve). Due to its unique history it was also called the ''World's Greatest Lost Treasure''. Several generations of German and Russian craftsmen worked on this masterpiece, prompted by several generations of monarchs. Construction began in 1701 to 1709 in [[Prussia]]. In 1716 the ''Amber Cabinet'' was given by Prussian king [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]] to his then ally, [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia]]. Then it was expanded by Russian craftsmen, and by 1770, when the work was finished, the Room covered more than 55 square meters and contained over six tons of amber. It was [[looted art|looted]] during [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany]], brought to [[Königsberg]] and lost in the chaos at the end of the war.

The first such elevator was invented by [[Ivan Kulibin]] and installed in the [[Winter Palace]] in 1793, while several years later another of Kulibin's elevators was installed in [[Arkhangelskoye Palace|Arkhangelskoye]] near [[Moscow]]. In 1823, an "ascending room" made its debut in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html Conveyor technology: Elevator] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110805032007/http://conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html |date=2011-08-05 }} at conveyor-tech.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The first steam-powered [[metal]]-[[hull (ship)|hulled]] icebreaker of the modern type was the Russian ''[[Pilot (icebreaker)|Pilot]]'', built in 1864 on orders of the merchant and shipbuilder [[Mikhail Britnev]]. It had the bow altered to achieve an ice-clearing capability (20° raise from keel line). This allowed the ''Pilot'' to push itself on the top of the ice and consequently break it. Britnev fashioned the bow of his ship after the shape of the old wooden [[Pomor]] [[koch (boat)|koch]]s, which had been navigating icy waters of the [[White Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]] for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filologdirect.narod.ru/history/2006_04_03.pdf Prolonging the navigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816091936/http://filologdirect.narod.ru/history/2006_04_03.pdf |date=2011-08-16 }} by Pavel Veselov. 1993. № 6. pp. 36-37. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Gymnasterka]]'''
* The gymnasterka was originally introduced into the [[Imperial Russian Army|Tsarist army]] about 1870 for wear by regiments stationed in [[Turkestan]] during the hot summers.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Mollo, page 137 "Uniforms of the Imperial Russian Army", {{ISBN|0-7137-0920-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took the form of a loose fitting white linen "shirt-tunic" and included the coloured shoulder-boards of the green tunic worn during the remainder of the year. The gymnasterka was taken into use by all branches of the Imperial Army at the time of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877-78.  Originally intended for working dress during peace-time and patterned on the traditional Russian peasant smock, the gymnasterka was subsequently adopted for ordinary duties and active service wear. It was worn as such by non-commissioned ranks in summer during the 1890s and early 1900s. The officers' equivalent was a white double breasted tunic or ''kitel''.  During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, the white gymnasterka with its red or blue shoulder-boards proved too conspicuous against modern weaponry and the garments were often dyed various shades of khaki.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ivanov and P. Jowett, page 19 "The Russo-Japanese War 1904-05", {{ISBN|1 84176 708 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smartness and comfort of the white gymnasterka enabled it to survive for a few more years of peacetime wear until a light khaki version was adopted in 1907-09 and worn during World War I.

'''1880s''' '''[[Winogradsky column]]'''
* The Winogradsky column is a simple device for culturing a large diversity of microorganisms. Invented in the 1880s by Sergei Winogradsky, the device is a column of pond mud and water mixed with a carbon source such as newspaper (containing cellulose), blackened marshmallows or egg-shells (containing calcium carbonate), and a sulfur source such as gypsum (calcium sulfate) or egg yolk. Incubating the column in sunlight for months results in an aerobic/anaerobic gradient as well as a sulfide gradient. These two gradients promote the growth of different microorganisms such as Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, Chlorobium, Chromatium, Rhodomicrobium, and Beggiatoa, as well as many other species of bacteria, cyanobacteria, and algae.

In 1881 Lunin, one of the workers in that school, fed mice upon an artificial mixture of the separate constituents of milk; of all the constituents, that is, which were then known, namely the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and salts. He found that upon such a mixture the animals failed to survive and was led to conclude that "a natural food such as milk must therefore contain besides these known principal ingredients small quantities of unknown substances essential to life". Such a statement, already half a century old, when allowed to stand out clear and apart from a context which tended to bury it, seems to contain the essentials of what is believed today. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610020638/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1929/hopkins-lecture.html |archivedate=10 June 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An idea to use the [[drift ice]] for the exploration of nature in the high latitudes of the [[Arctic Ocean]] belongs to [[Fridtjof Nansen]], who fulfilled it on ''[[Fram]]'' between 1893 and 1896. However, the first stations to be placed right upon the drifting ice originated in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1937, when the first such station in the world, [[North Pole-1]], started operating. More drifting ice stations were organised after [[World War II]], and many special equipment was developed for them, such as the elevated tents to be placed on the melting ice and indicators monitoring the ice cracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html | title=North Pole drifting stations (1930s-1980s) | publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720113545/http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html | archivedate=2011-07-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type of station, the rings transmit load to the columns either by "wedged arches" or through [[purlin]]s, forming a "column-purlin complex." The fundamental advantage of the column station is the significantly greater connection between the halls, compared with a [[pylon station]].

* The '''AK-47''' (other names include '''Avtomat Kalashnikova''', '''Kalashnikov''', or '''AK''') is a [[selective fire]], [[gas operated]] [[7.62×39mm]] [[assault rifle]], developed in the [[Soviet Union]] by [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]]. The AK-47 was one of the first true assault rifles. It has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with regular armed forces as well as irregular, revolutionary and terrorist organizations worldwide. Even after six decades, due to its durability, low production cost and ease of use, the original AK-47 and its numerous variants are the most widely used and popular assault rifles in the world; more AK-type rifles have been produced than all other assault rifles combined.&lt;ref name="poyer"&gt;Poyer, Joe.

'''1947 [[Laser microphone|Light beam microphone]]'''
* The technique of using a light beam to remotely record sound probably originated with Léon Theremin in the Soviet Union at or before 1947, when he developed and used the Buran eavesdropping system. This worked by using a low power infrared beam (not a laser) from a distance to detect the sound vibrations in the glass windows. Lavrentiy Beria, head of the KGB, used this Buran device to spy on the U.S., British, and French embassies in Moscow

'''1952 [[Carbon nanotubes]]'''
* A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal ''Carbon'' described the interesting and often misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to [[Sumio Iijima]] of [[NEC]] in 1991. In 1952 L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet ''Journal of Physical Chemistry''. This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in the Russian language, and Western scientists' access to Soviet press was limited during the [[Cold War]]. It is likely that carbon nanotubes were produced before this date, but the invention of the [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) allowed direct visualization of these structures.&lt;ref name="carbon"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Who should be given the credit for the discovery of carbon nanotubes?|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2006.03.019|first=Marc|last=Monthioux|journal=Carbon|volume=44|year=2006|url=http://www.cemes.fr/fichpdf/GuestEditorial.pdf|format=PDF|page=1621|last2=Kuznetsov|first2=V|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818063155/http://www.cemes.fr/fichpdf/GuestEditorial.pdf|archivedate=2006-08-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Радушкевич|first=Л.

'''1991 [[Thermoplan]]'''
* The '''thermoplan''' is a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]]-shaped [[airship]] of [[Hybrid airship|hybrid]] type, currently under development in [[Russia]]. The key feature of thermoplan is its two section structure. The main section of the airship is filled with [[helium]], while the other section is filled with air that can be heated or cooled by the engines. This design greatly improves the maneuverability, alongside the [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] shape which helps resist the powerful winds up to 20 metre per second. The projet was started in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, with the first working prototype tested in 1991. That was rather small airship, and the giant thermoplan wasn't built at that time due to the problems caused by the economy crisis of the 1990s. In the late 2000s (decade), the project was revived under the name ''Locomoskyner'' by the Russian company ''Locomosky'' in [[Ulyanovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locomosky.ru/en/ The official site of the ''Locomosky'' company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308235457/http://www.locomosky.ru/en/ |date=2010-03-08 }}

'''User assistance''' is a general term for guided assistance to a user of a [[software]] product. The phrase incorporates all forms of help available to a user. Assistance can also automatically perform procedures or step users through the procedure, depending on the question that the user asked. The term is broader than [[online help]], and includes procedural and tutorial information.

== What it does ==

User assistance provides information to help a person to interact with software. This can include describing the user interface, but also focuses on how to help the user to best apply the software capabilities to their needs. User assistance can be considered a component of the broader category of [[user experience]].

=== Devices ===

User assistance employs a number of devices including help, [[Wizard (software)|wizards]], [[tutorials]], printed manuals (and their [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] equivalents), and user interface text. User assistance professionals also contribute to enterprise knowledge bases and [[content management systems]].&lt;ref name="WritersUA"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Joe Welinske |title=Key Trends in Software User Assistance |url=http://www.writersua.com/articles/keytrends/ |website=WritersUA |accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skills required ===

Effective user assistance development requires a variety of communication skills. These include writing, editing, [[task analysis]], and [[subject matter expert]] (SME) interviewing. Since the user assistance profession is directly involved with software development, the discipline often requires an understanding of [[User interface|UI]] design, usability testing, [[Internationalization and localization|localization]], testing, [[quality assurance]], instructional design, [[script (computing)|script]]ing or [[Computer programming|programming]], and accessibility.&lt;ref name="WritersUA"/&gt;

== Forms ==

===Instruction manual===

''For information related to this topic, see [[Instruction manual (computer and video games)]]''

A traditional form of user assistance is a user manual, which is distributed either with the product in [[paper]] form or electronically. Typical features of a user manual include installation procedures, a guide to how to use the software, as well as a disclaimer stating the licensing status of the software. Details of a helpline may also be available.

'''Vocalink''' is a payment systems company headquartered in the [[United Kingdom]], created in 2007 from the merger between Voca and [[LINK (UK)|LINK]].&lt;ref name="Voca and LINK merger"&gt;{{cite web|title=Merger between LINK Interchange Network Limited and Voca Limited|url=https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/link-interchange-network-ltd-voca-ltd|work=Office of Fair Trading|publisher=www.oft.gov.uk|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It designs, builds and operates the UK payments infrastructure, which underpins the provision of the Bacs payment system, the Direct Debit system, the UK ATM LINK switching platform covering 65,000 ATMs and the UK Faster Payments systems.&lt;ref name="VocaLinks Place in UK Payments Infrastructure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Written evidence submitted by VocaLink|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmtreasy/612/612vw08.htm|work=House of Commons|publisher=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Bacs}}
In 1968, the Joint Stock Banks Clearing Committee chaired by Dennis Gladwell, set-up the Inter-Bank Computer Bureau to modernise the existing paper-based [[standing order (banking)|standing order]] system. Secure electronic funds transfer between banks was introduced from later that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|page=10|edition=Vol 3|title=Ninth Report of Session 2010–11|publisher=[[House of Commons Treasury Committee]]|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; significantly reducing both the processing time and human error associated with paper-based transactions, particularly bulk payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bacs Ltd and Charteris in new initiative to help major Bacs users |url=http://www.charteris.com/news/2004/bacs-ltd-and-charteris-in-new-initiative-to-help-major-bacs-users |publisher=Charteris plc |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 the company adopted the name "Bankers Automated Clearing Services Limited", soon shortened to [[Bacs]], which was formally adopted as the company's name in 1985.&lt;ref name=BACSCpHst&gt;{{cite web|title=Bacs Corporate History|url=https://www.bacs.co.uk/About/pages/corporateoverview.aspx|publisher=Bacs|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cruickshank Report===
In November 1998 [[HM Treasury]] commissioned a review of competition within the UK banking sector, to be chaired by [[Donald Cruickshank|Sir Don Cruickshank]]. Reporting in March 2000, [https://www.vocalink.com/media/1603/cruickshank_report_2000.pdf The Cruickshank Report] of competition within the UK banking sector recommended that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/eb025071|title=The Cruickshank report on competition in UK banking: Assessment and implications|date=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clearance scheme ownership and management should be split from infrastructure operation and delivery 
*Infrastructure management should be conducted on a commercial basis with fair and open access to third parties
*A need for a low-cost way to transfer money quickly&lt;ref name="The Cruickshank report"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cruickshank report: Competition in the banking industry under scrutiny|url=http://competition.practicallaw.com/7-101-1508|publisher=Practical Law Company|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on 1 December 2003, Bacs Payment Schemes Ltd (BPSL) was split from Bacs Limited. BPSL was established as a [[not for profit]] company with members from the banking industry, the purpose of which is to promote the use of automated payment schemes and govern the rules of the Bacs scheme. Bacs Limited owns the infrastructure to run the Bacs scheme. Bacs Limited was permitted to continue to use the Bacs name for one year, becoming Voca Limited on 12 October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bacs|url=https://www.bacs.co.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/FAQs.aspx|publisher=Bacs|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LINK Interchange Network Ltd===
{{main|LINK (UK)}}
[[LINK (UK)|LINK Interchange Network Ltd]] was formed in 1985 to create interoperability between [[Automated Teller Machine|ATMs]] across the United Kingdom. It became an international network in the 1990s through connection with the [[MasterCard]] and [[Visa Inc|Visa]] networks. In October 2002 LINK launched the first service that used ATMs as a retail channel, enabling the facility to top-up a mobile phone at an ATM, bringing banking and mobile phones together for the consumer.&lt;ref name="Top Up and Go"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Up and Go|url=http://www.topupandgo.com/why-choose-atms.aspx|publisher=Top Up and Go|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faster Payments Service==
In 2005 a joint proposal from Voca and LINK was selected to deliver the payment-processing infrastructure for the [[Faster Payments Service]], a near real-time interbank transfer for internet and telephone banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peachey|first=Kevin|title=How fast is faster payment plan?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7411338.stm|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=news.bbc.co.uk/|date=22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After forming a strong working partnership, which brought Voca's bulk processing together with LINK's real-time payment switching, the companies agreed to merge on 2 July 2007 to form '''VocaLink'''. Since its launch in 2008, over 3 billion real-time faster payment transactions have been processed by VocaLink.&lt;ref name="Voca LINK merger"&gt;{{cite web|title=OFT approves Voca-Link merger|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-business/2893/oft-approves-voca-link-merger/|publisher=www.computerworlduk.com|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK payments infrastructure==
VocaLink operates its services out of two [[data centers]] based in the UK; based in [[Harrogate]]&lt;ref name="VocaLink Harrogate Data Centre"&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Banking Supplement: Upwardly mobile|url=http://www.fstech.co.uk/fst/N-D09feature_RetailBankingSupp_MobileBanking.php|publisher=FSTech|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dunstable]].

===Bacs===
Bacs provides two payment products to consumers:
* Bacs Direct Credits, payer-initiated interbank transfers. VocaLink processes 2 billion of these payments every year, including over 90% of all UK salaries and 98% of state benefits.
* Direct Debits, transfers initiated by authorised payees. Three-quarters of UK adults have at least one direct debit commitment; the average person has at least six.&lt;ref name="Importance of Direct Debit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Late payments debt high enough to put UK SMEs out of business|url=http://www.sourcewire.com/news/74306/late-payments-debt-high-enough-to-put-uk-smes-out|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=www.sourcewire.com|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
VocaLink provides the underlying BacsTEL-IP infrastructure for Bacs,&lt;ref name="Voca flicks the SOA switch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voca flicks the SOA switch - Voca has overhauled its IT architecture in preparation for pan-European payments.|url=http://www.information-age.com/technology/applications-and-development/273486/voca-flicks-the-soa-switch|publisher=www.information-age.com|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which processes over 5.6 billion of clearing and settlement of automated payments a year,&lt;ref name="VocaLink Key Partnership for Payments"&gt;{{cite web|title=VocaLink|url=https://www.paymentsuk.org.uk/news-events/events/vocalink|publisher=The Payments Council|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a value of £4.2 trillion.

===LINK===
VocaLink provides the switching infrastructure behind LINK, the busiest ATM switching system in the world which switches over 3.5 billion card-initiated transactions from 130 million enabled cards annually.&lt;ref name="Das LINK"&gt;{{cite web|title=LINK - the UK ATM network|url=http://www.link.co.uk/about-link/|accessdate=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430060357/http://www.link.co.uk/about-link/|archive-date=30 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faster Payments Service===
VocaLink designed, built and operates the infrastructure for the Faster Payments Service on behalf of the Faster Payments Scheme. Running in parallel with Bacs and [[CHAPS]], launched in 2008 it enables interbank transfers in real time. Since 2008, over three billion Faster Payments transactions have been securely processed by VocaLink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realbusiness.co.uk/article/15026-late-payments-debt-high-enough-to-put-uk-smes-out-of-business|title=Late payments debt high enough to put UK SMEs out of business|author=Vanessa Zainzinger|publisher=Real Business|date=28 September 2012|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile payments==

===Paym===
{{main|Paym}}
VocaLink provides the underlying technology to [[Paym]], a [[mobile payment]] system for the UK developed by the Payments Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paym overview|url=http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/mobile_payments/overview_of_paym/|publisher=Payments Council|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients are identified by their [[mobile phone]] number instead of bank details such as [[sort code]] and account number.&lt;ref name=BBC26836380&gt;{{cite news|title=Payments via mobile number to start this month|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26836380|publisher=BBC News|date=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched through participating banks and building societies in April 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is involved?|url=http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/mobile_payments/who_is_involved/|publisher=Payments Council|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and once users opt-in will by the end of 2014 support 9 out of 10 UK bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Papworth|first=Jill|title=Paym promises mobile-to-mobile current account payments|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/10/payem-mobile-current-account-payments|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zapp===
VocaLink has developed Zapp, a function that will reside within mobile banking apps to allow users to make real-time payments to retailers when shopping online or in-store. The service will be open to all financial institutions, merchants, acquirers and consumers, when it launches in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25727333|title=UK lenders to offer Zapp payments in banking apps|author=Leo Kelion|publisher=BBC News|date=January 15, 2014|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016}}

A Zapp payment works through secure digital 'tokens', which means that customers don’t reveal any of their financial details to retailers. This also means that merchants do not need to store card details.

Zapp has been developed by VocaLink who operate the UK payments infrastructure. VocaLink processes over 90% of UK salaries, more than 70% of household bills and 98% of state benefits. In 2013 VocaLink processed over 10 billion transactions with a value of over £5 trillion.

On 12 July 2010 through [[Euro Alliance of Payment Schemes|EAPS]], LINK opened all UK cash machines to the similar German [[Girocard]] scheme operated by [[Zentraler Kreditausschuss]].&lt;ref name="LINK mit Zentraler Kreditausschuss"&gt;{{cite web|title=UK ATMs open to German Girocard Holders|url=http://www.link.co.uk/media/news-releases/news-releases-archive/uk-atms-open-to-german-girocard-holders/|publisher=LINK|accessdate=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229053208/http://link.co.uk/media/news-releases/news-releases-archive/uk-atms-open-to-german-girocard-holders/|archive-date=29 December 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the VocaLink agreement with the Pulse network allows [[Discover card]] and [[Diners Club]] International cardholders to use LINK ATMs.&lt;ref name="DINERS CLUB"&gt;{{cite news|title=DINERS CLUB INTERNATIONAL CARDS GAIN ACCESS TO THE LINK ATM NETWORK|url=https://www.dinersclub.com/about-us/press/diners-club-international-cards-gain-access-to-the-link-atm-network|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; VocaLink also provides a gateway service to [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]] and [[China Union Pay]].

Between 2007 and 2012, VocaLink operated a [[Single Euro Payments Area]] clearing and settlement mechanism, participating as a member of the [[European Automated Clearing House Association]]. The service was discontinued as a consequence of the low participation of VocaLink's shareholder UK banks into the platform.&lt;ref name="VocaLink SEPA"&gt;{{cite web|title=VocaLink ditches Sepa services|url=http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=22884|publisher=Finextra|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, VocaLink signed a deal with the Swedish Automated Clearing House [[Bankgirot]], to outsource part of the Swedish payments system. This was the first time that the processing of a national payments scheme has been transferred to a non-domestic player.&lt;ref name="VocaLink BGC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bankgirocentralen BGC AB launches strategic partnership with VocaLink|url=http://www.bgc.se/templates/NewsPage____6813.aspx|publisher=BGC|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, in partnership with [[BCS Information Systems]], VocaLink launched an immediate payments service, [[Fast And Secure Transfers]] (FAST) in [[Singapore]], enabling fourteen Singaporean banks to offer the ability to transfer funds between bank accounts in real time.
