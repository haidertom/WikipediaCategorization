The '''Arbeitskreis Börse''' (abbreviated '''AKB''' or '''AK Boerse''') is a [[non-profit organization]] located in [[Mannheim]] ([[Germany]]), focused on [[investment banking]], [[capital markets]], consulting and [[start-up companies]] within the [[financial technology]] sector. It is the oldest financial association lead by students in Germany and with over 1,000 members among the largest student organizations in Germany. The Arbeitskreis Börse is dedicated to connect students interested in financial markets associated with worldwide leading [[bank]]s and [[consulting firms]]. These include [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]] and [[Oliver Wyman]], which are premium partners of Arbeitskreis Börse. It is organized first and foremost by students of the [[University of Mannheim]] but is receiving increasing support from students of other tertiary establishments in [[Mannheim]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

== History ==
The Arbeitskreis Börse was founded in response to a perceived gap in the services provided by student societies at the [[University of Mannheim]]. Students interested in the [[stock exchange]] and [[financial markets]], that sought to actively participate in [[capital markets]] did not have the opportunity to do so whilst engaging on campus as no such opportunity had yet been offered. 
Therefore, a small group of students independently organized an evening event within the university with the aim of creating a platform for students interested in the financial markets . Supported by the University this group developed into a non-profit association which was registered by the city of [[Mannheim]] on November 6th 1984.

Corresponding with positive developments within financial markets, membership within the Arbeitskreis Börse steadily grew to exceed 1,000 students within a few years. Through their stock market analysis and research papers the Arbeitskries Börse rapidly became well throughout the [[Rhine-Neckar]] area, which led to leading global investment banks and consulting firms taking notice of the Arbeitskreis Börse. At the [[University of Mannheim]] the lecture series "Semester Program of the Arbeitskreis Börse" was established and the Arbeitskreis Börse focused on building partnerships with financial institutions within the European financial hubs, London and Frankfurt in the following years. To satisfy external requests the "Kreis der Freunde und Förderer des AKB" was founded in October 1988, an association that could be joined by everyone interested in the Arbeitskreis Börse.

Today the Arbeitskreis Börse is the largest finance association run by students in Germany and the largest student society at the [[University of Mannheim]]. The Arbeitskreis Börse still provides the same extensive semester program and within the framework of their lectures they attract renowned speakers from both the world's leading investment banks and consulting firms. While doing this the students of the [[University of Mannheim]] get the chance to develop business contacts at several networking events. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/wir-ueber-uns/historie/|title= History of Arbeitskreis Börse|accessdate =2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
As a student initiative, the Arbeitskreis Börse is mainly organized by students of the [[University of Mannheim]] in addition to several students from other tertiary establishments in [[Mannheim]]. In June, the Arbeitskreis Börse annually appoints its new leading team and executive board. The team is made up of the heads of five resorts: member management, [[event management]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[marketing]] and social events. The executive board consists of five additional students who are responsible for resort management, [[finances]], working groups, semester programme, special events, contacts to the university, developments of the Arbeitskreis Börse as an association, premium partners and other cooperation partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/wir-ueber-uns/team/|title= Team of Arbeitskreis Börse|accessdate= 2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arbeitskreis Börse is supported by external partners, including [[Oliver Wyman]], [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] as well as the [[Mannheim Business School]] and alumni.

== Activities and semester program ==
The Arbeitskreis Börse attempts to form a direct link between the theoretical frameworks covered in academic studies and the practical application of these within a company. 
During each semester various events are organized on Mannheim's main [[campus]] - the [[Mannheim Palace]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. Firstly topical lectures are held by renowned individuals from within the financial or consulting industry, these have for instance included Armin von Falkenhayn, Head of Global Corporate and Investment Banking Germany at [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]]; Dr. Marcus Schenk, [[Chief Financial Officer]] at [[Deutsche Bank]]: Christian Zorn, Head of Investment Banking Germany at [[Morgan Stanley]] and Frank Mattern, former [[CEO]] at [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]]. Occasionally representatives of other industries such as [[Kurt Bock]], [[CEO]] at [[BASF SE]], are invited to hold such lectures. Secondly, several company [[workshops]] as well as student work groups are conducted to support Mannheim students aspiring a career in the financial sector. Within these lectures, the various companies prepare case studies that provide insight into their structure and everyday work environment. Following these lectures, the audience is able to discuss specific topics with top tier personalities and get to know company recruiters as well as employees.

The companies that have held lectures or offered workshops during the past years in cooperation with the Arbeitskreis Börse are - besides the premium partners [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]] and [[Oliver Wyman]] - leading banks such as [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Commerzbank]], [[Fidelity]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Barclays]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Lazard]], [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]], [[UBS]], [[RBC Capital Markets]], [[Leonardo &amp; Co.]] and [[Jefferies]], the central banks [[European Central Bank]] and [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] in addition to leading consulting firms such as [[Bain &amp; Company]], [[Boston Consulting Group]], [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]], [[Roland Berger Strategy Consultants]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], [[L.E.K. Consulting]], [[strategy&amp;]]. Further cooperating companies are [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Perella Weinberg Partners]], Blackstone, [[3i|3I]], [[Fresenius]] and [[BASF SE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/events/archiv/|title=Event archives of Arbeitskreis Börse|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lectures ===
In cooperation with several company partners the Arbeitskreis Börse organizes an extensive lecture series every semester, composed of up to 12 company presentations and technical lectures concerned with current topics from the financial community and industry. To do so, companies from the fields of [[investment banking]], [[asset management]], [[consulting]] and [[auditing]] are invited to create a thought provoking presentation that explores various points of view. The lectures demonstrate relationships between the latest case studies and theoretical foundations from academia as well as findings from their business applications. At the following get-together with snacks and drinks students have the opportunity to get in personal contact with the speakers, to discuss specialist topics and ask questions regarding internships and career options.&lt;ref name="Startseite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/start/|title=akboerse.de|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workshops ===
Similar to this, the Arbeitskreis Börse, in cooperation with company partners organises numerous workshops every semester. Case studies offer a rare opportunity to gain better insight into specific business divisions and to analyse complex business matters. After the presentation of results, students come into contact with employees and are able ask specific questions and acquire information about a potential career within these companies. Getting to know preferences and strengths during the workshops makes it easier for a single business division or a certain enterprise to make a decision.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

=== Working groups ===
Another task of the Arbeitskreis Börse is to transmit knowledge in Excel and Bloomberg and to encourage active discussions with problems from the area of finance industry and management consultancy. Students can meet weekly to acquire and deepen fundamental knowledge in the respective subject areas under instruction from experienced Alumni to be optimally prepared for internships and entry into the workforce. To advanced students, a platform to discuss highly demanding problems is offered. The knowledge acquired in the working groups is indispensable for future entry into financial business.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

=== Social events ===
During each semester, numerous social events take place, which promote cohesion among members and help familiarise students with recently joined fellow students as well provide a temporary escape from stressful university life. Thus the students become part of a large community that outlasts their time at university and allows Alumni to return to Mannheim annually.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

The '''balanced scorecard'''  is a strategy [[performance management]] tool – a semi-standard structured [[report]], that can be used by managers to keep track of the execution of activities by the staff within their control and to monitor the consequences arising from these actions.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey&gt;{{cite web|title=2GC Balanced Scorecard Usage Survey|url=https://2gc.eu/survey|publisher=2GC Active Management|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase 'balanced scorecard' primarily refers to a performance management report used by a management team, and typically this team is focused on managing the implementation of a strategy or operational activities - in a recent survey&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt; 62% of respondents reported using Balanced Scorecard for strategy implementation management, 48% for operational management.  Balanced Scorecard is also used by individuals to track personal performance, but this is less common - only 17% of respondents in the survey using Balanced Scorecard in this way, however it is clear from the same survey that a larger proportion (about 30%) use corporate Balanced Scorecard elements to inform personal goal setting and incentive calculations.

The critical characteristics that define a balanced scorecard are:&lt;ref name=What_is_BSC_FAQ&gt;{{citation|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/faqs/what-is-a-balanced-scorecard|title=FAQ Answer: What is the Balanced Scorecard?|publisher=2GC Active Management|accessdate=11 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620093448/http://2gc.eu/files/2GC-FAQ1-What_is_a_Balanced_Scorecard_140616.pdf|archivedate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* its focus on the strategic agenda of the organization concerned
* the selection of a small number of data items to monitor
* a mix of financial and non-financial data items.

== Use ==
Balanced scorecard is an example of a [[closed-loop controller]] or cybernetic control applied to the management of the [[strategic control|implementation of a strategy]].&lt;ref name=Muralidharan_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muralidharan|first=Raman|title=A framework for designing strategy content controls|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|year=2004|volume=53|issue=7|pages=590–601|doi=10.1108/17410400410561213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Closed-loop or cybernetic control is where actual performance is measured, the measured value is compared to a reference value and based on the difference between the two corrective interventions are made as required.  Such control requires three things to be effective:
* a choice of data to measure,
* the setting of a reference value for the data,
* the ability to make a corrective intervention.&lt;ref name=Muralidharan_2004 /&gt;

Within the strategy management context, all three of these characteristic closed-loop control elements need to be derived from the organisation's strategy and also need to reflect the ability of the observer to both monitor performance and subsequently intervene – both of which may be constrained.&lt;ref name=Ouchi_1977&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ouchi|first=W. G.|title=The relationship between organisational structure and organisational control|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|year=1977|volume=2|issue=1|pages=95–113|doi=10.2307/2391748|jstor=2391748}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balanced Scorecard was initially proposed as a general purpose performance management system.&lt;ref name=Schneiderman&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneiderman|first=Arthur M.|title=Analog Devices: 1986–1992, The First Balanced Scorecard|url=http://www.schneiderman.com/Concepts/The_First_Balanced_Scorecard/BSC_INTRO_AND_CONTENTS.htm|publisher=Arthur M.

P. |title=The Balanced Scorecard – Measures That Drive Performance|journal=Harvard Business Review|year=1992|issue=January–February|pages=71–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Balanced scorecard has more recently become a key component of structured approaches corporate strategic management.&lt;ref name=legace_2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Legace|first=Martha|title=Strategy Execution and the Balanced Scorecard|journal=Harvard Business School Working Knowledge|year=2008|issue=August|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/strategy-execution-and-the-balanced-scorecard|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the ideas that underpin modern balanced scorecard designs concern making it easier to select which data to observe, and ensuring that the choice of data is consistent with the ability of the observer to intervene.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrie|first=Gavin J G|author2=Cobbold, I |title=3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard: Evolution of an effective strategic control tool|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|year=2004|volume=53|issue=7|pages=611–623|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/research/evolution-of-the-3rd-generation-balanced-scorecard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501201157/http://2gc.eu/files/resources/2GC-WP-Dev3rdGenBSC-090311.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2014|accessdate=11 July 2017|doi=10.1108/17410400410561231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Organizations have used systems consisting of a mix of financial and non-financial measures to track progress for quite some time.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Marc|author2=Manzoni, J |title=The balanced scorecard and tableau de bord: Translating strategy into action|journal=Management Accounting|year=1997|volume=79|issue=2|pages=28–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such system was created by Art Schneiderman in 1987 at [[Analog Devices]], a mid-sized semi-conductor company; the Analog Devices Balanced Scorecard.&lt;ref name=Schneiderman/&gt;  Schneiderman's design was similar to what is now recognised as a "First Generation" Balanced Scorecard design.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

In 1990 Art Schneiderman participated in an unrelated research study led by [[Robert S. Kaplan]] in conjunction with US management consultancy Nolan-Norton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nolannorton.com/|title=nolannorton.com|author=|date=|website=www.nolannorton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during this study described his work on performance measurement.&lt;ref name=Schneiderman/&gt;  Subsequently, Kaplan and [[David P. Norton]] included anonymous details of this balanced scorecard design in a 1992 article.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt; Kaplan and Norton's article wasn't the only paper on the topic published in early 1992&lt;ref name=Maisel_1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maisel|first=L. S.|title=Performance measurement: the Balanced Scorecard approach|journal=Journal of Cost Management|year=1992|volume=6|issue=2|pages=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 1992 Kaplan and Norton paper was a popular success, and was quickly followed by a second in 1993.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S|author2=Norton, D. P. |title=Putting the Balanced Scorecard to Work|journal=Harvard Business Review|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the two authors published a book ''The Balanced Scorecard''.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S|title=The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action|year=1996|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-0-87584-651-4|author2=Norton, D. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These articles and the first book spread knowledge of the concept of balanced scorecard widely, and has led to Kaplan and Norton being seen as the creators of the concept.

While the "corporate scorecard" terminology was coined by Art Schneiderman, the roots of performance management as an activity run deep in management literature and practice.  Management historians such as [[Alfred D. Chandler Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] suggest the origins of performance management can be seen in the emergence of the complex organisation – most notably during the 19th Century in the USA.&lt;ref name=Chandler_1962&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Alfred D.|title=Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the American Enterprise|year=1962|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-1-61427-508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent influences may include the pioneering work of General Electric on performance measurement reporting in the 1950s and the work of French process engineers (who created the ''tableau de bord'' – literally, a "dashboard" of performance measures) in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;  The tool also draws strongly on the ideas of the 'resource based view of the firm'&lt;ref name=Penrose_1959&gt;{{cite book|last=Penrose|first=Edith|title=The Theory of the Growth of the Firm|year=1959|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-828977-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by [[Edith Penrose]].  However it should be noted that none of these influences is explicitly linked to original descriptions of balanced scorecard by Schneiderman, Maisel, or Kaplan &amp; Norton.

Kaplan and Norton's first book&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_1996 /&gt; remains their most popular. The book reflects the earliest incarnations of balanced scorecards – effectively restating the concept as described in the second Harvard Business Review article.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993 /&gt;  Their second book, ''The Strategy Focused Organization'',&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|title=The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment|date=1 October 2000|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-57851-250-8|author2=Norton, D. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoed work by others (particularly a book published the year before by Olve et al. in Scandinavia&lt;ref name=Olve_1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Olve|first=Nils-Göran|title=Performance Drivers: A practical guide to using the Balanced Scorecard|date=25 Feb 1999|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-98623-2|author2=Roy, J. |author3=Wetter, M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) on the value of visually documenting the links between measures by proposing the "Strategic Linkage Model" or [[strategy map]].

As the title of Kaplan and Norton's second book&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2000 /&gt; highlights, even by 2000 the focus of attention among thought-leaders was moving from the design of Balanced Scorecards themselves, towards the use of Balanced Scorecard as a focal point within a more comprehensive strategic management system.  Subsequent writing on Balanced Scorecard by Kaplan &amp; Norton has focused on uses of Balanced Scorecard rather than its design (e.g. "The Execution Premium" in 2008&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|title=The Execution Premium: Linking Strategy to Operations|date=1 July 2008|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-1-4221-2116-0|author2=Norton, D. P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;), however many others have continued to refine the device itself (e.g. Abernethy et al.&lt;ref name=abernethy_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abernethy|first=Margret A|last2=Horne |first2=M. |last3=Lillis |first3=A.M. |last4=Malina |first4=M.A. |last5=Selto |first5=F.H.|title=A multi-method approach to building causal performance maps from expert knowledge|journal=Management accounting research|year=2005|volume=16|issue=2|pages=135–155|doi=10.1016/j.mar.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Characteristics ==
The characteristics of the balanced scorecard and its derivatives is the presentation of a mixture of financial and non-financial measures each compared to a 'target' value within a single concise report.  The report is not meant to be a replacement for traditional financial or operational reports but a succinct summary that captures the information most relevant to those reading it.  It is the method by which this 'most relevant' information is determined (i.e., the design processes used to select the content) that most differentiates the various versions of the tool in circulation. The balanced scorecard indirectly also provides a useful insight into an organisation's strategy – by requiring general strategic statements (e.g. mission, vision) to be precipitated into more specific/tangible forms.&lt;ref name=Shulver_Antarkar_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shulver|first=Michael J|author2=Antarkar, N |title=The Balanced Scorecard as a Communication Protocol for Managing Across Intra-Organizational Borders|journal=Proceedings from the 12th Annual Conference of the Production and Operations Management Society, Orlando, Florida, USA.|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first versions of balanced scorecard asserted that relevance should derive from the [[corporate strategy]], and proposed design methods that focused on choosing measures and targets associated with the main activities required to implement the strategy.  As the initial audience for this were the readers of the [[Harvard Business Review]], the proposal was translated into a form that made sense to a typical reader of that journal – managers of US commercial businesses.  Accordingly, initial designs were encouraged to measure three categories of non-financial measure in addition to financial outputs – those of "customer," "internal business processes" and "learning and growth."  These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations,&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Max|title=Improving and evaluating performance with the Public Sector Scorecard|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|year=2017|volume=66|issue=4|pages=442–458|doi=10.1108/IJPPM-06-2015-0092}}&lt;/ref&gt; or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997),&lt;ref name=Butler_1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=A.|author2=Letza S. R. |author3=Neale B. |title=Linking the Balanced Scorecard to Strategy|journal=Long Range Planning|year=1997|volume=30|issue=2|pages=242–253|doi=10.1016/s0024-6301(96)00116-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn (2001),&lt;ref name=Ahn_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=H|title=Applying the Balanced Scorecard Concept: An Experience Report|journal=Long Range Planning|year=2001|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–461|doi=10.1016/s0024-6301(01)00057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elefalke (2001),&lt;ref name=Elefalke_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elefalke|first=K|title=The Balanced Scorecard of the Swedish Police Service: 7000 officers in total quality management project|journal=Total Quality Management|year=2001|volume=12|issue=7|pages=958–966|doi=10.1080/09544120120096106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brignall (2002),&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brignal|first=S.|title=The UnBalanced Scorecard: a Social and Environmental Critique|journal=Proceedings, Third International Conference on Performance Measurement and Management (PMA2002)|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin (2002),&lt;ref name=Irwin_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=D|title=Strategy Mapping in the Public Sector|journal=International Journal of Strategic Management|year=2002|volume=35|issue=6|pages=563–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radnor et al.

Modern balanced scorecards have evolved since the initial ideas proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the modern performance management tools including Balanced Scorecard are significantly improved – being more flexible (to suit a wider range of organisational types) and more effective (as design methods have evolved to make them easier to design, and use).&lt;ref name=Malina_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malina|first=M. A.|author2=Selto, F. H. |title=Communicating and Controlling Strategy: An Empirical Study of the Effectiveness of the Balanced Scorecard|journal=Journal of Management Accounting Research|year=2001|volume=13|pages=47–90|doi=10.2308/jmar.2001.13.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Design of a balanced scorecard is about the identification of a small number of financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance 'meets expectations'. By alerting managers to areas where performance deviates from expectations, they can be encouraged to focus their attention on these areas, and hopefully as a result trigger improved performance within the part of the organization they lead.&lt;ref name=Muralidharan_2004 /&gt;

The original thinking behind a balanced scorecard was for it to be focused on information relating to the implementation of a strategy, and over time there has been a blurring of the boundaries between conventional strategic planning and control activities and those required to design a balanced scorecard. This is illustrated well by the four steps required to design a balanced scorecard included in Kaplan &amp; Norton's writing on the subject in the late 1990s:

# Translating the vision into operational goals;
# Communicating the vision and link it to individual performance;
# Business planning; index setting
# Feedback and learning, and adjusting the strategy accordingly.

These steps go far beyond the simple task of identifying a small number of financial and non-financial measures, but illustrate the requirement for whatever design process is used to fit within broader thinking about how the resulting balanced scorecard will integrate with the wider business management process.

Although it helps focus managers' attention on strategic issues and the management of the implementation of strategy, it is important to remember that the balanced scorecard itself has no role in the formation of strategy.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt; In fact, balanced scorecards can co-exist with [[strategic planning]] systems and other tools.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;

=== First Generation ===

The first generation of balanced scorecard designs used a "four perspective" approach to identify what measures to use to track the implementation of strategy. `The original four "perspectives" proposed&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt; were:
* '''Financial''': encourages the identification of a few relevant high-level financial measures.  In particular, designers were encouraged to choose measures that helped inform the answer to the question "How do we look to shareholders?" Examples: cash flow, sales growth, operating income, return on equity.&lt;ref name=simons_1994&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=Robert L.|title=Levers of Control: How Managers Use Innovative Control Systems to Drive Strategic Renewal: How Managers Use Control Systems to Drive Strategic Renewal|date=1 December 1994|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-0-87584-559-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Customer''': encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What is important to our customers and stakeholders?" Examples: percent of sales from new products, on time delivery, share of important customers’ purchases, ranking by important customers.
* '''Internal business processes''': encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What must we excel at?"Examples: cycle time, unit cost, yield, new product introductions.
* '''Learning and growth''': encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "How can we continue to improve, create value and [[innovation|innovate]]?". Examples: time to develop new generation of products, life cycle to product maturity, time to market versus competition.

The idea was that managers used these perspective headings to prompt the selection of a small number of measures that informed on that aspect of the organisation's strategic performance.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;  The perspective headings show that Kaplan and Norton were thinking about the needs of non-divisional commercial organisations in their initial design.  These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations,&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS /&gt; or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997),&lt;ref name=Butler_1997 /&gt; Ahn (2001),&lt;ref name=Ahn_2001 /&gt; Elefalke (2001),&lt;ref name=Elefalke_2001 /&gt; Brignall (2002),&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt; Irwin (2002),&lt;ref name=Irwin_2002 /&gt;, Flamholtz (2003)&lt;ref name=Flamholtz_2003 /&gt;, Radnor et al. (2003)&lt;ref name=Radnor_2003 /&gt;).

These suggestions were notably triggered by a recognition that different but equivalent headings would yield alternative sets of measures, and this represents the major design challenge faced with this type of balanced scorecard design: justifying the choice of measures made. "Of all the measures you could have chosen, why did you choose these?"  These issues contribute to dis-satisfaction with early Balanced Scorecard designs, since if users are not confident that the measures within the Balanced Scorecard are well chosen, they will have less confidence in the information it provides.&lt;ref name=Kellermans_2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellermans|first=Walter J.|author2=Floyd F. W. |author3=Veiga S. W. |author4=Matherne C. |title=Strategic Alignment: A missing link in the relationship between strategic consensus and organisational performance|journal=Strategic Organization|year=2013|volume=11|issue=3|pages=304–328 |doi=10.1177/1476127013481155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although less common, these early-style balanced scorecards are still designed and used today.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;

In short, first generation balanced scorecards are hard to design in a way that builds confidence that they are well designed. Because of this, many are abandoned soon after completion.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;

=== Second generation ===

In the mid-1990s, an improved design method emerged.&lt;ref name=Olve_1999 /&gt; In the new method, measures are selected based on a set of "strategic objectives" plotted on a "strategic linkage model" or "[[strategy map]]". With this modified approach, the strategic objectives are distributed across the four measurement perspectives, so as to "connect the dots" to form a visual presentation of strategy and measures.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_CMR_1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|author2=Norton D. P. |title=Linking the Balanced Scorecard to Strategy|journal=California Management Review|year=1996|volume=39|issue=1|pages=53–79|doi=10.2307/41165876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this modified version of balanced scorecard design, managers select a few strategic objectives within each of the perspectives, and then define the cause-effect chain among these objectives by drawing links between them to create a "strategic linkage model".  A balanced scorecard of strategic performance measures is then derived directly by selecting one or two measures for each strategic objective.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;   This type of approach provides greater contextual justification for the measures chosen, and is generally easier for managers to work through.  This style of balanced scorecard has been commonly used since 1996 or so: it is significantly different in approach to the methods originally proposed, and so can be thought of as representing the "2nd generation" of design approach adopted for the balanced scorecard since its introduction.

=== Third generation ===
{{Main|Third-generation balanced scorecard}}
In the late 1990s, the design approach had evolved yet again. One problem with the "second generation" design approach described above was that the plotting of causal links amongst twenty or so medium-term strategic goals was still a relatively abstract activity. In practice it ignored the fact that opportunities to intervene, to influence strategic goals are, and need to be, anchored in current and real management activity. Secondly, the need to "roll forward" and test the impact of these goals necessitated the creation of an additional design instrument: the Vision or Destination Statement. This device was a statement of what "strategic success", or the "strategic end-state", looked like. It was quickly realized that if a Destination Statement was created at the beginning of the design process, then it was easier to select strategic activity and outcome objectives to respond to it. Measures and targets could then be selected to track the achievement of these objectives. Design methods that incorporate a Destination Statement or equivalent (e.g. the [[results-based management]] method proposed by the UN in 2002) represent a tangibly different design approach to those that went before, and have been proposed as representing a "third generation" design method for balanced scorecards.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

Design methods for balanced scorecards continue to evolve and adapt to reflect the deficiencies in the currently used methods, and the particular needs of communities of interest (e.g. NGO's and government departments have found the third generation methods embedded in results-based management more useful than first or second generation design methods).&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Kalff_Andersen_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrie|first=Gavin J. G.|author2=Kalff D. |author3=Andersen H. |title=Balanced Scorecard and Results- Based Management – Convergent Performance Management Systems|journal=Proceedings of 3rd Annual Conference on Performance Measurement and Management Control, the European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management (EIASM), Nice, France|year=2005|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/research/balanced-scorecard-and-results-based-management-convergent-performance-mana|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation refined the second generation of balanced scorecards to give more relevance and functionality to strategic objectives. The major difference is the incorporation of Destination Statements. Other key components are strategic objectives, strategic linkage model and perspectives, measures and initiatives.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

== Popularity ==
In 1997, Kurtzman&lt;ref name=Kurtzman_1997&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtzman|first=Joel|title=Is your company off course?  Now you can find out why.|newspaper=Fortune|date=17 February 1997|pages=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 64 percent of the companies questioned were measuring performance from a number of perspectives in a similar way to the balanced scorecard. Balanced scorecards have been implemented by government agencies, military units, business units and corporations as a whole, non-profit organizations, and schools.

Balanced scorecard has been widely adopted, and consistently has been found to be the most popular performance management framework in a widely respected annual survey (e.g. see results from 2003&lt;ref name=Rigby_2003&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigby|first=D.|title=Bain and Company's Management Tools and Trends Survey 2003|url=http://www.unstoppablegrowth.com/bainweb/PDFs/cms/Public/12065.pdf|publisher=Bain &amp; Company|accessdate=11 July 2017|author2=Bilodeau B. |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013&lt;ref name=Rigby_2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigby|first=D.|title=Bain and Company's Management Tools and Trends Survey 2013|url=http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/management-tools-and-trends-2013.aspx|publisher=Bain &amp; Company|accessdate=28 May 2014|author2=Bilodeau B. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407005331/http://bain.com/publications/articles/management-tools-and-trends-2013.aspx|archivedate=7 April 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Theorists have argued from the earliest days of discussion of Balanced Scorecard usage that much of the benefit of the balanced scorecard comes from the design process itself.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneiderman|first=Arthur M.|title=Why Balanced Scorecards fail|journal=Journal of Strategic Performance Measurement|year=1999|issue=January}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, it is argued that many failures in the early days of balanced scorecard could be attributed to this problem, in that early balanced scorecards were often designed remotely by consultants&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999 /&gt; - it is suggested that by not being involved in the design, the relevant managers who were to use the device did not trust, and so failed to engage with and use the devices.&lt;ref name=Malina_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

== Variants ==
Since the balanced scorecard was popularized in the early 1990s, a large number of alternatives to the original 'four box' balanced scorecard promoted by Kaplan and Norton&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt; in their various articles and books have emerged.  Most have very limited application, and are typically proposed either by academics as vehicles for expanding the dialogue beyond the financial bottom line – e.g. Brignall (2002)&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt; or consultants as an attempt at differentiation to promote sales of books and / or consultancy (e.g. Neely et al. (2002),&lt;ref name=Prism_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Neely|first=Andy|title=The Performance Prism: The Scorecard for Measuring and Managing Business Success: The Scorecard for Measuring and Managing Stakeholder Relationships|date=27 May 2002|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=London|isbn=978-0-273-65334-9|author2=Adams C. |author3=Kennerley M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne (2002),&lt;ref name=Bourne_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourne|first=Mike|title=Balanced Scorecard in a Week|date=29 November 2002|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=London|isbn=978-0-340-84945-3|author2=Bourne P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Niven (2002)&lt;ref name=Niven_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Niven|first=Paul R.|title=Balanced Scorecard Step-by-step: Maximizing Performance and Maintaining Results|date=18 April 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-07872-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Many of the structural variations proposed are broadly similar, and a research paper published in 2004&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt; attempted to identify a pattern in these variations – noting three distinct types of variation. The variations appeared to be part of an evolution of the balanced scorecard concept, and so the paper refers to these distinct types as "generations".  Broadly, the original 'measures in four boxes' type design (as initially proposed by Kaplan &amp; Norton&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;) constitutes the 1st generation balanced scorecard design; balanced scorecard designs that include a 'strategy map' or 'strategic linkage model' (e.g. the Performance Prism,&lt;ref name=Prism_2002 /&gt; later Kaplan &amp; Norton designs&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2008 /&gt; the Performance Driver model of Olve, Roy &amp; Wetter (English translation 1999,&lt;ref name=Olve_1999 /&gt; 1st published in Swedish 1997)) constitute the 2nd Generation of Balanced Scorecard design; and designs that augment the strategy map / strategic linkage model with a separate document describing the long-term outcomes sought from the strategy (the "destination statement" idea) comprise the 3rd generation balanced scorecard design.

Variants that feature adaptations of the structure of balanced scorecard to suit better a particular viewpoint or agenda are numerous. Examples of the focus of such adaptations include the triple bottom line,&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt; decision support,&lt;ref name=Ioppolo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ioppolo|first1=Giuseppe|last2=Saija|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Salomone|first3=Roberta|title=Developing a Territory Balanced Scorecard approach to manage projects for local development: Two case studies|journal=Land Use Policy|date=July 2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=629–640|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837711001190|accessdate=30 June 2014|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2011.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; public sector management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Northcott|first1=Deryl|last2=Taulapapa|first2=Tuivaiti Ma'amora|title=sing the balanced scorecard to manage performance in public sector organizations|journal=The International Journal of Public Sector Management|date=2012|volume=25|issue=3|pages=166–191|doi=10.1108/09513551211224234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and health care management.&lt;ref name=Moullin_PSS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moullin|first1=Max|last2=Soady|first2=John|last3=Skinner|first3=John|last4=Price|first4=Charles|last5=Cullen|first5=John|last6=Gilligan|first6=Christine|title=Using the Public Sector Scorecard in Public Health|journal=Journal of Health Care Quality Assurance|date=2007|volume=20|issue=4|pages=281–289|doi=10.1108/09526860710754352}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance management elements of the UN's [[Results Based Management]] system have strong design and structural similarities to those used in the 3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard design approach.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Kalff_Andersen_2005 /&gt;

Balanced scorecard is also linked to [[quality management]] tools and activities.&lt;ref name="gardiner_2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardiner|first1=P. D.|last2=Simmons|first2=J. E. L.|title=Performance measurement tools: The balanced scorecard and the EFQM excellence model|journal=Measuring Business Excellence|date=2003|volume=7|issue=1|pages=14–29|doi=10.1108/13683040310466690}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there are clear areas of cross-over and association, the two sets of tools are complementary rather than duplicative.&lt;ref name=andersen_lawrie_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=Henrik V.|last2=Lawrie|first2=Gavin|last3=Savič|first3=Nenad|title=Effective quality management through third-generation balanced scorecard|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|date=2004|volume=53|issue=7|pages=634–645|doi=10.1108/17410400410561259|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235283963_Effective_quality_management_through_third-generation_balanced_scorecard|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balanced scorecard is also used to support the payments of incentives to individuals,&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt; even though it was not designed for this purpose and is not particularly suited to it.&lt;ref name=What_is_BSC_FAQ /&gt;&lt;ref name=2GC_IPM_2003&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I link corporate and individual performance management systems?|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/research/designing-incentive-systems-linking-people-performance-and-reward|publisher=2GC Active Management|accessdate=11 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528144138/http://2gc.eu/files/resources/2GC-WP-LCIPMS-090311.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Academic criticism of the balanced scorecard can be broken into three distinct (but overlapping) areas of concern.

# The first kind of criticism focuses on the empirical nature of the framework, and when it was originally proposed the lack of any formal validation of the ideas. Kaplan and Norton notoriously failed to include any citations of earlier articles in their initial papers on the topic&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993 /&gt;, an absence noted, for example, by Norreklit&lt;ref name=Norreklit_2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norreklit|first=Hanne|title=The balance on the balanced scorecard – a critical analysis of some of its assumptions|journal=Management Accounting Research|year=2000|volume=11|issue=1|pages=65–88|doi=10.1006/mare.1999.0121}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Others identified technical flaws in the methods and design of the original balanced scorecard &lt;ref name=Malina_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lingle_1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lingle|first=J. H.|author2=Schiemann W. A. |title=From balanced scorecard to strategic gauges: Is measurement worth it?|journal=Management Review|year=1996|volume=85|issue=3|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; or concerning the lack of validation for the approach - for example Flamholtz observed that no validation was provided for the choice of the "four perspectives" of the 1st Generation design&lt;ref name=Flamholtz_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flamholtz|first=Erik|title=Putting Balance and Validity into the Balanced Scorecard|journal=Journal of Human Resource Costing and Accounting|year=2003|volume=7|issue=3|pages=15-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
# The second kind of criticism is that the balanced scorecard does not provide a bottom line score or a unified view with clear recommendations: it is simply a list of metrics (e.g. Jensen 2001&lt;ref name=Jensen_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=M. C.|title=Value maximisation, stakeholder theory, and the corporate objective function|journal=European Financial Management|year=2001|volume=7|issue=3|pages=297–318|doi=10.1111/1468-036x.00158}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  These critics usually include in their criticism suggestions about how the 'unanswered' question postulated could be answered, but typically the unanswered question relate to things outside the scope of balanced scorecard itself (such as developing strategies) (e.g. Brignall&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt;)
# The third kind of criticism is that the model fails to fully reflect the needs of stakeholders – putting bias on financial stakeholders over others.  Early forms of Balanced Scorecard proposed by Kaplan &amp; Norton&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993 /&gt; focused on the needs of commercial organisations in the USA – where this focus on investment return was appropriate.  This focus was maintained through subsequent revisions.&lt;ref name=Adams_2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=C.|title=Performance measurement frameworks: a review|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK.|author2=Neely A. |author3=Kennerley M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now over 20 years after they were first proposed, the four most common perspectives in Balanced Scorecard designs mirror the four proposed in the original Kaplan &amp; Norton paper.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;  However, as noted earlier in this article, there have been many studies that suggest other perspectives might better reflect the priorities of organisations – particularly but not exclusively relating to the needs of organisations in the public and Non Governmental sectors.&lt;ref name=Andersen_Lawrie_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=Henrik V.|last2=Lawrie|first2=Gavin|title=Examining Opportunities for Improving Public Sector Governance Through Better Strategic Management|journal=Proceedings, Third International Conference on Performance Measurement and Management (PMA 2002),|date=2002|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237340660_Examining_Opportunities_for_Improving_Public_Sector_Governance_Through_Better_Strategic_Management|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the balanced scorecard does not address important aspects of nonprofit strategy such as social dimensions, human resource elements, political issues and the distinctive nature of competition and collaboration in nonprofit settings.&lt;ref name=Kong_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=E.|title=Analysing BSC and IC's usefulness in non-profit organisations.|journal=Journal of Intellectual Capital|date=2010|volume=11|issue=3|pages=284–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS /&gt; More modern design approaches such as [[third generation balanced scorecard|3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard]], the Public Sector Scorecard&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS /&gt; and the UN's [[Results Based Management]] methods explicitly consider the interests of wider stakeholder groups, and perhaps address this issue in its entirety.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Kalff_Andersen_2005 /&gt;

In response to these concerns there have been many studies seeking to provide (retrospective) academic underpinnings for the Balanced Scorecard concept&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999 /&gt;, and to provide case study and validation information for the various design generations&lt;ref name=Elefalke_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radnor_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawrie_et_al_2016 /&gt;.  There are relatively few reliable assessments of the effectiveness of the approaches embodied in Balanced Scorecard, but some studies demonstrate a link between the use of balanced scorecards and better decision making or improved financial performance of companies&lt;ref name=Ittner_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ittner|first1=C.D.|last2=Larcker|first2=D.F.|last3=Randall|first3=T.|title=Performance implications of strategic performance measurement in financial services firms|journal=Accounting Organizations and Society|date=2003|volume=28|issue=7|pages=715–741}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Broadcast surveys of usage have difficulties in this respect, due to the wide variations in definition of 'what a balanced scorecard is' noted above (making it hard to work out in a survey if you are comparing like with like).&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;  Single organization case studies suffer from the 'lack of a control' issue common to any study of organizational change – what the organization would have achieved if the change had not been made isn't known, so it is difficult to attribute changes observed over time to a single intervention (such as introducing a balanced scorecard).  However, such studies as have been done have typically found balanced scorecard to be useful.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Malina_2001 /&gt;

Consideration has been given to the effect of organisation size on Balanced Scorecard effectiveness:  
* For large organisations this work has focused on how to translate aggregate corporate strategies into performance management tools relevant to individual teams / units within the organisation.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_et_al_2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrie|first1=Gavin V.|last2=Abdullah|first2=N.A.|last3=Bragg|first3=Christopher|last4=Varlet|first4=Guillaume|title=Multi-level strategic alignment within a complex organisation|journal=Journal of Modelling in Management|date=2016|volume=11|issue=4|pages=889–910|doi=10.1108/JM2-11-2014-0085|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309818479_Multi-level_strategic_alignment_within_a_complex_organisation|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In SMEs Balanced Scorecard has been found to be effective, but it has been noted that focus is required on balancing design complexity and relevance with the availability of resource to do the design work.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Andersen_2006&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Andersen|first2=Henrik V.|last1=Lawrie|first1=Gavin|title=Balanced Scorecard implementation in SMEs: reflection in literature and practice|journal=Proceedings of the Fourth SMESME Conference|date=2006|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252637217_Balanced_Scorecard_implementation_in_SMEs_reflection_in_literature_and_practice|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have argued that the Balanced Scorecard is unsuitable for SMEs for a variety of reasons, including the belief that SMEs lack a long-term strategic focus (Hvolby and Thorstenson (2000), McAdam (2000)), that changes in an SME’s strategy are too frequent,&lt;ref name=rompho_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rompho|first1=N.|title=Why the Balanced Scorecard Fails in SMEs: A Case Study.|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|date=2011|volume=6|issue=11|pages=39–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that SMEs have limited knowledge about performance measurement in general (Rantanen and Holtari 2000) and therefore do not recognise the benefits that might accrue from use of the tool (McAdam 2000; Bourne 2001), but it is also important to note that none of these studies attempts to theorise the reasons behind their negative findings.

== Software tools ==

It is important to recognize that the balanced scorecard by definition is not a complex thing – typically no more than about 20 measures spread across a mix of financial and non-financial topics, and easily reported manually (on paper, or using simple office software).&lt;ref name=Adams_2007 /&gt;

The processes of collecting, reporting, and distributing balanced scorecard information can be labor-intensive and prone to procedural problems (for example, getting all relevant people to return the information required by the required date).  The simplest mechanism to use is to delegate these activities to an individual, and many Balanced Scorecards are reported via ad-hoc methods based around email, phone calls and office software.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;

In more complex organizations, where there are multiple balanced scorecards to report and/or a need for co-ordination of results between balanced scorecards (for example, if one level of reports relies on information collected and reported at a lower level) the use of individual reporters is problematic.  Where these conditions apply, organizations use balanced scorecard reporting software to automate the production and distribution of these reports.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;

Recent surveys have consistently found that roughly one third of organizations use generic office software to report their balanced scorecard, one third used software developed specifically for their own use, and one third used one of the many commercial packages available.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;&lt;ref name=intrafocus_surveys&gt;{{cite web|title=Balanced Scorecard Surveys (2012–2016)|url=https://www.intrafocus.com/services/balanced-scorecard-survey|publisher=Intrafocus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">{{Banking |image=London.bankofengland.arp.jpg |caption=The [[Bank of England]], established in 1694.}}A '''banker's lien''' is a legal right arise in many [[common law jurisdictions]] of a [[bank]] to exercise a [[lien]] over any property in the custody of the bank as security for the indebtedness of the customer to the bank.&lt;ref name=Ellinger&gt;{{cite book |author1=E.P.

==Scope==
The precise effect of a banker's lien varies according to the laws of a particular jurisdiction.  Under English common law it applies to all property coming into the possession of the bank in the usual course of banking business,&lt;ref&gt;''Brandao v Barnett'' (1846) 12 Cl 7 F 787&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the important exception that it does not apply to property which is deposited with the bank for safe custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Leese v Martin'' (1873) LR 17 Eq 224 at 235.  The bank holds such property as [[bailment|bailee]], and may be entitled to exercise a separate lien as such.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most common law liens normally only give the lienee a passive right to retain the property, unusually, the banker's lien permits the bank the sell the relevant property.&lt;ref&gt;''Rosenberg v International Banking Corporation'' (1923) 14 Ll LR 344 at 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The lien does not generally extend to intangible rights, including credit balances on accounts.  However those credit balances may be subject to the [[banker's right to combine accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785&lt;/ref&gt;

The banker's lien may be modified or abrogated by agreement.&lt;ref name=Ellinger /&gt;

'''Bestshoring''', also known as rightshoring, is the process of identifying the best location to move [[manufacturing]], [[Information technology|IT]] or [[business]] processes for a company. The decision is to be based on quantifiable criteria which are intended to take subjective and [[political]] input out of the [[decision cycle]]. Many companies use external [[consulting firm]]s to make these decisions.

On August 1, 2004, [[Hillary Clinton]] wrote an article explaining why bestshoring beats [[outsourcing]]. Her argument is that "[[Foreign labor]] isn't as cheap as it seems."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3174">A '''business alliance''' is an agreement between businesses, usually motivated by [[cost reduction]] and improved service for the customer. Alliances are often bounded by a single agreement with [[Equity (economics)|equitable]] [[risk]] and opportunity share for all parties involved and are typically managed by an integrated project team. An example of this is [[code sharing]] in [[airline alliance]]s.

==Types==
There are five basic categories or types of alliances:&lt;ref name="Kuglin"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kuglin | first = F.A. | authorlink = |author2=J. Hook | title = Building, Leading, and Managing Strategic Alliances: How to Work Effectively and Profitably With Partner Companies | publisher = American Management Association | date = 2002 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sales: A sales alliance occurs when two companies agree to go to market together to sell complementary products and services. 
*Solution-specific: A solution-specific alliance occurs when two companies agree to jointly develop and sell a specific marketplace solution. 
*Geographic-specific:  A geographic-specific alliance is developed when two companies agree to jointly market or [[co-brand]] their products and services in a specific geographic region.
*Investment: An investment alliance occurs when two companies agree to join their funds for mutual investment. 
*Joint venture: A [[joint venture]] is an alliance that occurs when two or more companies agree to undertake economic activity together.

In many cases, alliances between companies can involve two or more categories or types of alliances.

== Horizontal alliances ==

A type of an alliance is a horizontal alliance. For example, a horizontal alliance can occur between [[logistics |logistics service providers]], i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are potentially competing.&lt;ref name="rauewieland"&gt;Raue, J.S. &amp; Wieland, A. (2015), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/IJLM-08-2012-0083 The interplay of different types of governance in horizontal cooperations: a view on logistics service providers]. The International Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 26, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In a horizontal alliance, these partners can benefit twofold. On one hand, they can "access tangible resources which are directly exploitable." In this example extending common transportation networks, their warehouse infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages can be achieved by combining resources. On the other hand, partners can "access intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable." This typically includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation.&lt;ref name="rauewieland"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">{{citations|date=January 2018}}'''Business mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] used by [[Commerce|commercial]] enterprises to record and manage [[business operations]]. Commercial organizations use mathematics in [[accounting]], [[inventory management]], [[marketing]], sales [[forecasting]], and [[financial analysis]].  

Mathematics typically used in commerce includes [[elementary arithmetic]], elementary [[algebra]], [[statistics]] and [[probability]].  Business management can be done more effectively in some cases by use of more advanced mathematics such as [[calculus]], [[Matrix_(mathematics)#Basic_operations|matrix algebra]] and [[linear programming]].

==High school==
''Business mathematics, '' sometimes called ''commercial math''  or ''consumer math'', is a group of practical subjects used in [[commerce]] and everyday life. In schools, these subjects are often taught to students who are not planning a university education.  In the United States, they are typically offered in [[high schools]] and in schools that grant [[associate's degrees]]; elsewhere they may be included under [[Business studies]].  The emphasis in these courses is on computational skills and their practical application, with practical application being predominant. 

A (U.S.) business math course might include a review of [[elementary arithmetic]], including [[fractions]], [[decimals]], and [[percentages]]. Elementary [[algebra]] is often included as well, in the context of solving practical business problems. The practical applications typically include [[checking accounts]], [[discounts and allowances|price discounts]], [[markup (business)|markups and Markup]], [[payroll]] calculations, [[interest|simple and compound interest]], [[credit (finance)|consumer and business credit]], and [[mortgages]] and [[revenues]].

==University level==
===Undergraduate===
"Business Mathematics" comprises mathematics courses taken at an [[undergraduate]] level by [[Business education#Undergraduate education|business students]]. The two most common here are ''Business Calculus'' and ''[[Business Statistics]]''.  Programs often also cover matrix operations as above, and may include a separate module on [[time value of money|interest calculations]].

These courses are usually focused on problems from the business world, and the syllabus is adjusted correspondingly. Thus for example, whereas in a regular calculus course students would study [[trigonometric functions]], courses here would not typically cover this area. Correspondingly, these courses typically do not go into the same depth as standard courses in the mathematics or science fields.  (Although see [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] and [[Bachelor of Business Science]].) 

Note that [[Bachelor of Economics|economics majors]], especially those planning to pursue  [[Master of Economics|graduate study in the field]], are encouraged to instead take regular calculus, as well as [[linear algebra]] and other advanced math courses, especially [[real analysis]]. Some programs (instead) include a module in "mathematics for economists", providing a bridge between the above "Business Mathematics" courses and [[mathematical economics]] and [[econometrics]].
[[Operations management]] (and [[management accounting]]) may similarly include supplementary coursework in relevant quantitative techniques, generally linear programming as above, as well as other optimization methods.

===Postgraduate===
[[Business_education#Postgraduate_education|At the postgraduate level]], ''generalist'' management and finance programs include quantitative topics which are foundational for the study in question - often exempting students with an appropriate background. These are usually "interest mathematics" and statistics, both at the above level. [[MBA]] programs often also include basic [[operations research]] (linear programming, as above) with the emphasis on practice, and may combine the topics as "quantitative analysis"; [[master of science in finance|MSF programs]] may similarly cover applied [[econometrics]].

More technical [[masters degree|Masters]] in these areas, such as those in [[management science]] and [[Master of Quantitative Finance|quantitative finance]], will entail a deeper, more theoretical study of operations research and econometrics, and extend to further advanced topics such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[stochastic calculus]]. These programs do not include "Business mathematics" ''per se''.

Where [[mathematical economics]] is not required, [[Master of Economics|graduate economics programs]] often include "quantitative techniques", which covers (applied) [[linear algebra]] and [[multivariate calculus]], and may include the above topics; regardless, econometrics is usually a separate course, and is dealt with in depth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4796">A '''business partner''' is a commercial entity with which another commercial entity has some form of [[Business alliance|alliance]]. This relationship may be a [[contract]]ual, exclusive bond in which both entities commit not to ally with third parties. Alternatively, it may be a very loose arrangement designed largely to impress customers and competitors with the size of the network the business partners belong to.

== Business mating (partnership formation) ==
A business partner or alliance can be crucial for businesses. However, businesses can not choose business partners in any way they want. In many instances, the potential partner might not be interested in forming a business relationship, also known as business mating. It is important that both sides of the agreement complement each other, but also that there are some common ground. For example, in management style, mindset, and also technology. If, for example, management style would be too different between the firms then a partnership could be problematic. Kask and Linton (2013) &lt;ref&gt;Kask and Linton (2013) Business mating: when start-ups get it right http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08276331.2013.876765#.U0UEcfl_t8F&lt;/ref&gt; investigate under what conditions business mating (formation) takes place for startup firms seeking business partners. 

== Differentiation ==
The meaning of the term is quite different from that implied in [[partnership]], and it is because of the potential for confusion between the two that widespread use of 'business partner' has been discouraged at times in the past.

A business partner can be:
# A [[Distribution (business)|supplier]]
# A [[customer]]
# A channel intermediary (such as an [[agent (law)|agent]] or [[reseller]]), or
# A vendor of complementary offerings (for example, one party sells the hardware, while the other sells the software)
This is a wider definition than a [[business alliance]].

A Business Partner is becoming more common in HR departments as it represents the employees position, ideally seeing the HR issues from the employers and employees point of view. Small and medium business are often turning to external HR Business Partners to solve any HR disputes.

== Cohesion ==
One example of a business partnership is the "Agility Alliance" originated by [[Electronic Data Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eds.com/services/alliances/agility/ |title=Agility Alliance &amp;#124; HP Services |publisher=Eds.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this IT-focused alliance include [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[SAP AG|SAP]].  This highlights two problems with multi-party partnerships:
* Two of the companies may be partners with a third member of the partnership, but highly aggressive towards each other.  (Oracle and SAP compete against each other in the [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]]  market.)
* One party may be partner to a second party when targeting one market, but competitive against that same company when targeting another market.  (Microsoft may be happy to work with Sun when Sun is offering its servers, but far less happy when Sun is proposing [[OpenOffice.org]], in contention with Microsoft Office.)

== Business partner search ==
'''Business partner search''' or '''business matchmaking''' is the process/service of finding buyers/customers, distributors, licensees, and/or other business partners. This can be provided as a paid service by a commercial organization, or as a free service by the commercial section of a country's embassy/consulate or an association of businesses in a particular area.

Customarily commercial consideration of this service is a one time fee. Fee of this service depends on the business domain, the volume of business of both partners that will end up in a partnership relation as the end result of this service, etc.

In a specific example of a specific domain this fee is found between EUR 1800~2200 depending on the tasks required from the business matchmaker.

{{distinguish|proprietary software|commercial software}}

'''Business software''' or a business application is any [[software]] or set of computer programs used by business users to perform various business functions. These business applications are used to increase productivity, to measure productivity and to perform other business functions accurately.

By and large, business software is likely to be developed to meet the needs of a specific business, and therefore is not easily transferable to a different business  environment, unless its nature and operation is identical. Due to the unique requirements of each business, off-the-shelf software is unlikely to completely address a company's needs. However, where an on-the-shelf solution is necessary, due to time or monetary considerations, some level of customization is likely to be required. Exceptions do exist, depending on the business in question, and thorough research is always required before committing to bespoke or off-the-shelf solutions.

Some business applications are interactive, i.e., they have a [[graphical user interface]] or user interface and users can query/modify/input data and view results instantaneously. They can also run reports instantaneously. Some business applications run in batch mode: they are set up to run based on a predetermined event/time and a business user does not need to initiate them or monitor them.

Some business applications are built in-house and some are bought from vendors (off the shelf software products). These business applications are installed on either desktops or big servers. Prior to the introduction of COBOL (a universal compiler) in 1965, businesses developed their own unique machine language.  RCA's language consisted of a 12-position instruction. For example, to read a record into memory, the first two digits would be the instruction (action) code. The next four positions of the instruction (an 'A' address) would be the exact leftmost memory location where you want the readable character to be placed. Four positions (a 'B' address) of the instruction would note the very rightmost memory location where you want the last character of the record to be located. A two digit 'B' address also allows a modification of any instruction. Instruction codes and memory designations excluded the use of 8's or 9's. The first RCA business application was implemented in 1962 on a 4k RCA 301.  The RCA 301, mid frame 501, and large frame 601 began their marketing in early 1960.             

Many kinds of users are found within the business environment, and can be categorized by using a small, medium and large matrix:

* The small business market generally consists of home [[accounting software]], and [[office suite]]s such as [[OpenOffice.org]] or [[Microsoft Office]].
* The medium size, or [[small and medium-sized enterprise]] (SME), has a broader range of software applications, ranging from accounting, [[groupware]], [[customer relationship management]], [[human resource management systems]], [[outsourcing relationship management]], loan origination software, [[shopping cart software]], field service software, and other productivity enhancing applications.
* The last segment covers enterprise level software applications, such as those in the fields of [[enterprise resource planning]], [[enterprise content management]] (ECM), [[business process management]] (BPM) and [[product lifecycle management]]. These applications are extensive in scope, and often come with modules that either add native functions, or incorporate the functionality of third-party computer programs.

Technologies that previously only existed in [[peer-to-peer]] software applications, like [[Kazaa]] and [[Napster]], are starting to appear within business applications.

== Types of business tools ==
* [[Enterprise application software]] (EAS)
* [[Resource Management]]
* [[Dashboard (business)|Digital dashboards]], also known as [[business intelligence]] dashboards, enterprise dashboards, or executive dashboards.  These are visually based summaries of business data that show at-a-glance understanding of conditions through metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). Dashboards are a very popular  tools that have arisen in the last few years.{{when|date=April 2012}}
* Online analytical processing ([[OLAP]]),  (which include [[HOLAP]], [[ROLAP]] and [[MOLAP]]) - are a capability of some management, decision support, and executive information systems that support interactive examination of large amounts of data from many perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;James O'Brien and George Marakas, Management Information Systems, 7th ed. McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of reporting software|Reporting software]] generates aggregated views of data to keep the management informed about the state of their business.
* [[Procurement software]] is business software that helps to automate the purchasing function of organizations.
* [[Data mining]] is the extraction of consumer information from a database by utilizing software that can isolate and identify previously unknown patterns or trends in large amounts of data. There is a variety of data mining techniques that reveal different types of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Marketing Terms, 3rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the techniques that belong here are [[Statistics|statistical methods]] (particularly [[business statistics]]) and [[neural network]]s, as very advanced means of analyzing data.
* [[Business performance management]] (BPM)
* [[Document management]] software is made for organizing and managing multiple documents of various types. Some of them&lt;ref&gt;recent document management software products&lt;/ref&gt; have storage functions for security and back-up of valuable business information.
* [[Employee scheduling software]]- used for creating and distributing employee schedules, as well as for tracking employee hours.

== Brief history ==
{{Tone|section|date=February 2008}}
The essential motivation for business software is to increase profits by cutting costs or speeding the [[productive cycle]]. In the earliest days of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] business [[automation]], large [[mainframe computer]]s were used to tackle the most tedious jobs, like bank cheque clearing and factory accounting.

Factory accounting software was among the most popular of early business software tools, and included the automation of [[general ledger]]s, fixed assets inventory ledgers, cost accounting ledgers, accounts receivable ledgers, and accounts payable ledgers (including payroll, life insurance, health insurance, federal and state insurance and retirement).

The early use of software to replace manual white-collar labor was extremely profitable, and caused a radical shift in white-collar labor. One computer might easily replace 100 white-collar 'pencil pushers', and the computer would not require any health or retirement benefits.

Building on these early successes with IBM, Hewlett-Packard and other early suppliers of business software solutions, corporate consumers demanded business software to replace the old-fashioned drafting board. CAD-CAM software (or [[computer-aided drafting]] for [[computer-aided manufacturing]]) arrived in the early 1980s. Also, [[project management software]] was so valued in the early 1980s that it might cost as much as $500,000 per copy (although such software typically had far fewer capabilities than modern project management software such as [[Microsoft Project]], which one might purchase today for under $500 per copy.)

In the early days, perhaps the most noticeable, widespread change in business software was the word processor. Because of its rapid rise, the ubiquitous IBM typewriter suddenly vanished in the 1980s as millions of companies worldwide shifted to the use of [[Word Perfect]] business software, and later, [[Microsoft Word]] software. Another vastly popular computer program for business were mathematical spreadsheet programs such as [[Lotus 1-2-3]], and later [[Microsoft Excel]].

In the 1990s business shifted massively towards [[globalism]] with the appearance of [[SAP AG|SAP]] software which coordinates a supply-chain of vendors, potentially worldwide, for the most efficient, streamlined operation of factory manufacture.

Yet nothing in the history of business software has had the global impact of the [[Internet]], with its [[email]] and websites that now serve commercial interests worldwide. Globalism in business fully arrived when the Internet became a household word.

The next phase in the evolution of business software is being led by the emergance of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which involves identifying and automating highly repetitive tasks and processes, with an aim to drive operational efficiency, reduce costs and limit [[human error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stokes|first1=Jonathan|title=A Two-Pronged Approach to Overcome Challenges in the Insurance Industry|url=https://medium.com/@stokesjonathan38/a-two-pronged-approach-to-overcome-challenges-in-the-insurance-industry-b26146f9cb70|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industries that have been in the forefront of RPA adoption include the Insurance industry, Banking and Financial Services, the Legal industry and the Healthcare industry.

== Application support ==
Business applications are built based on the requirements from the business users. Also, these business applications are built to use certain kind of Business transactions or data items. These business applications run flawlessly until there are no new business requirements or there is no change in underlying Business transactions. Also, the business applications run flawlessly if there are no issues with computer hardware, computer networks (Intenet/intranet), computer disks, power supplies, and various software components (middleware, database, computer programs, etc.).

Business applications can fail when an unexpected error occurs. This error could occur due to a data error (an unexpected data input or a wrong data input), an environment error (an in frastructure related error), a programming error, a human error or a work flow error. When a business application fails one needs to fix the business application error as soon as possible so that the business users can resume their work. This work of resolving business application errors is known as business application support.

=== Reporting errors ===
The Business User calls the business application support team phone number or sends an e-mail to the business application support team. The business application support team gets all the details of the error from the business user on the phone or from the e-mail. These details are then entered in a tracking software. The tracking software creates a request number and this request number is given to the business user. This request number is used to track the progress on the support issue. The request is assigned to a support team member.

=== Notification of errors ===
For critical business application errors (such as an application not available or an application not working correctly), an e-mail is sent to the entire organization or impacted teams so that they are aware of the issue. They are also provided with an estimated time for application availability.

=== Investigation or analysis of application errors ===
The business application support team member collects all the necessary information about the business software error. This information is then recorded in the support request. All of the data used by the business user is also used in the investigation. The application program is reviewed for any possible programming errors.

=== Error resolution  ===
If any similar business application errors occurred in the past then the issue resolution steps are retrieved from the support knowledge base and the error is resolved using those steps. If it is a new support error, then new issue resolution steps are created and the error is resolved. The new support error resolution steps are recorded in the knowledge base for future use. For major business application errors (critical infrastructure or application failures), a phone conference call is initiated and all required support persons/teams join the call and they all work together to resolve the error.

=== Code correction ===
If the business application error occurred due to programming errors, then a request is created for the application development team to correct programming errors. If the business user needs new features or functions in the business application, then the required analysis/design/programming/testing/release is planned and a new version of the business software is deployed.

=== Business process correction ===
If the business application error occurred due to a work flow issue or human errors during data input, then the business users are notified. Business users then review their work flow and revise it if necessary. They also modify the user guide or user instructions to avoid such an error in the future.

=== Infrastructure issue correction ===
If the business application error occurred due to infrastructure issues, then the specific infrastructure team is notified. The infrastructure team then implements permanent fixes for the issue and monitors the infrastructure to avoid the re-occurrence of the same error.

== Support follow up and internal reporting ==
The business application error tracking system is used to review all issues periodically (daily, weekly and monthly) and reports are generated to monitor the resolved issues, repeating issues, and pending issues. Reports are also generated for the IT/IS management for improvement and management of business applications.

A '''business suite''' is a set of business software functions enabling the core business and business support processes inside and beyond the boundaries of an organization.

== Overview ==
The key characteristic of a business suite is the delivery of end-to-end [[business processes]] which span organizational boundaries such as business departments and locations. In the last years the focus of the business processes supported by business suites has expanded to integrate business partners such as customers, suppliers and service providers .

Business Suites are generally rooted in the traditional [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems that are based on a common [[data model]] used to storing the data to be shared between departments and their [[business processes]]. Most corporate ERP systems have been enhanced and complemented by additional applications over the years. As a result, the total cost of ownership ([[Total cost of ownership|TCO]]) grows, process integrity across applications is at stake, and the flexibility to consistently change and optimize business processes suffers. The vendors of business suites claim to address these issues.

== Topics ==
The issues with business process visibility, flexibility, efficiency, and integrity in heterogeneous business application environments have recently created 2 basic types of business suites:

* The "cumulative" business suite consists of a set of previously separate applications that are connected at the [[middleware]] or [[database]] level. The absence of a unified data and process model complicates the implementation of end-to-end processes with ensured process integrity for customers. System integrators are addressing this issue at the expense of a business suite owner.
* The "organic" business suite delivers end-to-end business processes designed to run in one offering. Modern organic business suites provide additional openness to integrate with other applications or extend processes to business partners through [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] technologies.

== Business Process Scope ==
A business suite usually encompasses all core business and business support processes of an organization, unlike business applications such as [[treasury management]] or [[Customer relationship management|CRM]]  that have been designed to serve a single [[line of business]].

Since no vendor today offers applications covering all business process requirements of larger organizations, vendors complement their application portfolio through acquisitions or through cooperation with specialized partners.

===Two strategies===
A "coverage through acquisition" strategy is confined to the processes that are entirely under the control of a single organization, while the "coverage through cooperation" approach can also enable and support processes that span the boundaries of multiple organizations like suppliers, customers, banks.

===Foundational processes===
The foundational set of [[business process]]es supported by a business suite includes business support processes to manage financials, build, develop and administer the workforce, run facilities, support the procurement of generic goods and services. Those foundational processes are required to sustain a functional enterprise that complies with all regulatory requirements.

===Value drivers===
The next layer of business processes is sometimes grouped by the main value drivers or differentiators of a company:
* Development, production, sales, and distribution of [[Product (business)|products]]
* Acquisition, operations, and compliance of production [[assets]]
* Management of the production, logistics, and distribution network
* Marketing, sales, production, and service for [[customer]]s
* Cost/performance optimized procurement, production, and operations

===Processes in support of value drivers===
Key processes supporting those value drivers invariably span organizational boundaries and are relevant for multiple [[Line of business|lines of business]]. A typical [[business process]] that connects organizational entities is "order to cash" which can span sales, production, finance, logistics, billing and dispute management and influences important key performance indicators of the involved areas like "[[Free cash flow|free cash-flow]]", "[[customer satisfaction]]", "[[customer profitability]]", "fulfillment cost".

Some business suites offer a layer of deep industry processes - either through industry extensions of the core business suite or through a network of frequently certified 3rd party software providers which adopt compatible or identical process and data models.

===Current status===
Today, no commercial business suite can cover all business process requirements of a large organization. Modern business suites offer an environment in which an organization can develop or modify business processes reusing the supplied standard processes. Some advanced business suites allow the fast composition of new business processes from process fragments or process steps.

A '''change request''' is a [[document]] containing a call for an adjustment of a [[system]]; it is of great importance in the [[change management process]].

[[Image:Example change request.png|right|350px|'''Figure 1''': Example change request for the car industry|alt=]]

A change request is declarative, i.e. it states what needs to be accomplished, but leaves out how the change should be carried out. Important elements of a change request are an ID, the customer (ID), the [[Deadline (time limit)|deadline]] (if applicable), an indication whether the change is required or optional, the change type (often chosen from a domain-specific [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]) and a change [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], which is a piece of narrative (Keller, 2005). An example of a change request can be found in Figure 1 on the right.

Change requests typically originate from one of five sources: 
# problem reports that identify [[Software bug|bugs]] that must be fixed, which forms the most common source
# system enhancement requests from [[User (computing)|users]]
# events in the development of other systems
# changes in underlying structure and or standards (e.g. in software development this could be a new operating system)
# demands from senior management (Dennis, Wixom &amp; Tegarden, 2002).
Additionally, in [[Project Management]], change requests may also originate from an unclear understanding of the goals and the objectives of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Dave. [http://www.pmhut.com/how-to-control-change-requests "How to Control Change Requests"], ''PM Hut'', November 15, 2009. Retrieved on March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Change requests have many different names, which essentially describe the same concept:
* Request For Change (RFC) by Rajlich (1999); RFC is also a common term in [[ITIL]] (Keller, 2005) and [[PRINCE2]] (Onna &amp; Koning, 2003).
* Engineering Change (EC) by Huang and Mak (1999);
* Engineering Change Request (ECR) at Aero (Helms, 2002);
* Engineering Change Order (ECO) by Loch and Terwiesch (1999) and Pikosz and Malmqvist (1998). Engineering Change Order is a separate step after ECR. After ECR is approved by Engineering Department then an ECO is made for making the change;
* Change Notice at Chemical (Helms, 2002);
* Action Request (AR) at ABB Robotics AB (Kajko-Mattson, 1999);
* Change Request (CR) is, among others, used by Lam (1998), Mäkäräinen (2000), Dennis, et al. (2002), Crnkovic, Asklund and Persson-Dahlqvist (2003) and at ABB Automation Products AB (Kajko-Mattsson, 1999).
* Operational Change Request (OCR).
* Enterprise Change Request (ECR).

==Overview==
The term "chief innovation officer" was first coined and described in the 1998 book ''[[Fourth Generation R&amp;D]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, W. and Morris, L. Fourth Generation R&amp;D - Managing Knowledge, Technology, and Innovation, Wiley, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations with a CINO/CTIO are practicing part of the fourth generation of innovation theory and practice to emerge since 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, W. Chapter 21 "The Generations of R&amp;D and Innovation Management", Encyclopedia of Technology &amp; Innovation Management, edited by V.K. Narayanan &amp; Gina Colarelli O'Connor, Wiley 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Successful chief innovation officers focus on delivering on the key principles behind innovation - [[leadership]], creating networks, harnessing [[Voice of the customer|VOC]]/HOC in idea development, leveraging the right incentives, and building/running an effective, transparent, and efficient innovation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2012/05/24/5-key-success-principles-the-cure-for-innovation-envy/ |title=5 Key Success Principles – the Cure for Innovation Envy &amp;#124; Innovation Management |publisher=Innovationmanagement.se |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CINO is responsible for managing the innovation process inside the organization that identifies [[strategies]], [[business opportunities]] and new [[technologies]] and then develops new capabilities and [[architectures]] with partners, new [[business models]] and new industry structures to serve those opportunities.

CINO/CTIO doesn't have to report to the CEO or another C-level executive. CINO/CTIO is a functional title, similar to the [[chief information security officer]]. The words "chief" and "officer" are used to communicate that a person in this position is responsible for driving innovation throughout the entire organization. Using a functional "chief ... officer" title helps to communicate that this is a cross-organizational position and enables this person to work across organizational silos.

The CINO/CTIO focuses on radical or breakthrough innovation. The coined term CINO/CTIO is used to differentiate the position from the [[chief information officer]], who is responsible for the information technology and computer systems that support enterprise goals.

==Chief technology innovation officer==
A chief technology innovation officer (CTIO) is focused on the organizational innovation through technology. This is an important strategic position especially in an organization that has significant technology component in addition to the traditional information technology. This position is typically held by a person with a broad technical expertise in that organization's industry.

The title chief technology innovation officer is commonly used in the organizations that have a technology component as a part of its core business. The CTIO is responsible for maintaining organizational technological strategy, defining the requirements for new technology implementations and communicating them to key business stakeholders.

The CTIO is responsible for organizational leadership on technology issues, management of the technology research and review function, ensuring the alignment of technology vision with business strategy, and for driving technology innovation throughout the entire organization. The position can also be responsible for tracking new technology developments in areas of interest to the organization to ensure that it maintains a technological edge within the industry, analyzing and improving upon technology standards and maintaining organizational awareness of new technologies.

A '''considered purchase''' is a complex buying decision with a high degree of financial and/or emotional risk and reward.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/130774/impulse-vs-considered-purchase-strategy.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This process requires meaningful investigation and comparison by key decision makers and influencers prior to a [[Financial transaction|transaction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wingmanadv.com/what-motivates-your-consumer-to-make-a-considered-purchase&lt;/ref&gt;  All purchase decisions fall along a spectrum of complexity and consequence depending on the [[Variable (research)|variables]] and relevant information involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://nelsonschmidt.com/considered-purchase-marketing&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike an [[impulse purchase]], a considered purchase typically has a long purchase cycle and significant consequences.  Considered purchase decisions exist in both the consumer and commercial realms involving both products and services.

Joshua March founded Conversocial in November 2009 in London. After spending two years working with applications for social media for both the Facebook Developer Garage London and iPlatform, he realized that social media was the future of communications online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/sep/27/iplatform-bought-betapond|title=iPlatform bought by social media marketing company Betapond|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 April 2013|location=London|first=Jemima|last=Kiss|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After iPlatform, which they sold to social media marketing company Betapond in 2012, March has focused solely on Conversocial.

'''Converting companies''' are companies that specialize in combining raw materials such as [[polyester]]s, adhesives, [[silicone]], [[adhesive tape]]s, foams, plastics, felts, rubbers, liners and metals, as well as other materials, to create new products.

Materials such as [[paper]], [[plastic film]], foil and cloth often are produced in long, continuous sheets that are rolled up for more convenient handling and transportation.  These rolls of material vary significantly in size and weight — ranging from {{convert|2|-|203|inch|cm|0}} wide and weighing as much as several tons. The converting industry takes these continuous rolls of thin, flat materials — known as webs — threads them through processing machines (such as printing presses, laminating, coating and slitting machines) and converts or changes the web of material into an intermediate form or final product.  For example, a converter’s equipment might take a web of plastic film, cut it into lengths, and fuse their edges, thus converting it into plastic bags.  This activity is known as web processing.

==Processes==
Typical converting processes are coating, laminating and printing. [[Coating]] technologies can include hot melt coating, gravure coating, [[curtain coating]] and slot-die coating. The most common printing techniques are [[flexo]] printing and [[rotogravure]] (gravure) printing. Both print processes are suited to high speed roll-to-roll processing.

Many converting companies will process large diameter, wide rolls of material as this increases the converting efficiency by minimising changes. On completion of the converting process the rolls may be cut into smaller rolls on a [[roll slitting|slitting machine]]. These rolls are then a convenient size for handling on packaging and other machines.  Alternatively, the rolls may be sheeted-cut into sheets — as happens in newspaper and book printing.  Further processes such as collation may occur after sheeting.

==Web alignment==
Web alignment is an important part of a converting operation as a moving web of material has a tendency to track off course and wander out of alignment during the converting processes. To avoid these problems, engineers have developed a variety of automatic web-guiding systems that assure production accuracy and reduce waste. Web-guiding systems typically are positioned just before a critical stage on a converting machine (for example, just before a print station on a printing press).

Each type of [[Web-guiding systems|web guiding system]] uses a sensor to monitor the web position for lateral tracking, and each has an actuator to shift the running web mechanically back on course whenever the sensor detects movement away from the set path. Actuators may be pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, or some kind of electromechanical device. Because the web may be fragile — particularly at its edge — non-contact sensors are used.  These sensors may be [[Pneumatic web guides|pneumatic]], photoelectric, ultrasonic, or infrared. The system’s controls must put the output signals from the sensors in to a form that can drive the actuator. Many controls today are electronic, typically using an amplifier to convert signals from the sensor, then commanding a special servo motor incorporating a lead or ball screw for guiding actuation. The latest web guiding systems have touch screen controls to simplify the setup procedure. Some web guiding systems have been designed specifically for the converting industry.

==Services==
Many converters specialize in 
* Adhesive coating to make [[labels]] and [[adhesive tape]]
* Silicone coating to make a [[release liner]]
* [[Die (manufacturing)|Die]]-cutting materials into finished parts or labels
* Printing services
* [[Roll slitting]] of wide webs into narrow webs or coils
* Laminating services
* [[Vacuum forming]]

==Newer technology==
Some converting companies now incorporate electronics in their finished products.  For example, converters producing [[RFID]] stock labels must incorporate RFID chips and antenna inlays.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.abgint.com/news_archive/05_apr_rfid_converter.html Description of an RFID upgrade at a conversion company] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131016043335/http://www.abgint.com/news_archive/05_apr_rfid_converter.html |date=2013-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electronic components make up the [[RFID tag]].  The tag stores the information about the items that have been tagged.  These converters therefore sometimes incorporate volume electronics manufacturing practices including controlling static electricity, electronic manufacturing test and similar processes.  Solving some of the issues of inclusion of materials sensitive to external influences has led to more tech companies embracing roll-based manufacturing processes, with particular success in the lithium ion and solar cell manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref name="lithium"&gt;[http://www.universalconvertingequipment.com/lithium-ion-and-solar-cell-manufacturers-increasingly-embracing-web-processes Lithium ion and solar cell manufacturers increasingly embracing converter web processes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paper converting==
{{advert|date=January 2018}}
The process of processing pre-cut cartons or "blanks" and folding them into the appropriate shape to become finished packaging containers is known as tray forming or carton erecting. These machines can create, for example, nacho trays, chinese noodle soup boxes, pizza boxes, french fry trays, hamburger clamshells, etc.

'''Corporate jargon''', variously known as '''corporate speak''', '''corporate lingo''', '''business speak''', '''business jargon''', '''management speak''', '''workplace jargon''', '''corporatese''' or '''commercialese''', is the [[jargon]] often used in large [[corporation]]s, [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]], and similar workplaces.&lt;ref name="Garner2009-2"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bryan A. Garner]]|title=[[Garner's Modern American Usage]]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd3byNeBdR4C|accessdate=21 March 2013|edition=3rd|date=28 July 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-987462-0|pages=168–69|chapter=Commercialese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; The use of corporate jargon is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/going-forward-corporatese-should-be-confined-to-the-dustbin-20170316-guzxvi.html|title=Going forward, corporatese should be confined to the dustbin|last=Linnell|first=Garry|date=17 March 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone is associated with managers of large corporations, business management consultants, and occasionally government. Reference to such jargon is typically derogatory, implying the use of long, complicated, or obscure words, abbreviations, [[euphemism]]s, and acronyms. For that reason some of its forms may be considered as an [[argot]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;"corporate argot" in [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116165746415401680 The Jargon Jumble: Kids Have 'Skeds,' Colleagues, 'Needs'], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 24 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these words may be actually new inventions, designed purely to fit the specialized meaning of a situation or even to "[[spin doctor|spin]]" negative situations as positive situations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Marketing speak''' is a related label for wording styles used to promote a product or service to a wide audience by seeking to create the impression that the vendors of the service possess a high level of sophistication, skill, and technical knowledge. Such language is often used in [[marketing]] [[press releases]], [[advertising copy]], and prepared statements read by executives and politicians.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Examples ==
{{See also|Glossary of business and management terms|List of buzzwords}}

Many terms have straightforward meanings in other contexts (e.g., leverage in physics, picked up with a well-defined meaning in finance), but are used more loosely in business speak. For example, ''[[deliverable]]'' is used to refer to anything that has to be done by a certain date to be verified by another party.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The phrases ''going forward'' or ''moving forward'' make a confident gesture towards the future, but are generally vague on timing, which usually means it can be removed from a sentence with little or no effect on its overall meaning.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Legal terms such as "[[Chapter 11]]" can be used without explaining what they are about: for example, Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code is about [[Bankruptcy in the United States|US bankruptcy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Cross-docking''' is a practice in [[logistics]] of unloading materials from an incoming [[semi-trailer truck]] or [[railroad car]] and loading these materials directly into outbound trucks, trailers, or rail cars, with little or no storage in between. This may be done to change the type of conveyance, to sort material intended for different destinations, or to combine material from different origins into transport vehicles (or containers) with the same or similar destinations.

Cross-dock operations were pioneered in the US trucking industry in the 1930s{{cn|date=April 2014}}, and have been in continuous use in less-than-truckload (LTL) operations ever since. The US military began using cross-docking operations in the 1950s. Wal-Mart began using cross-docking in the retail sector in the late 1980s.

In the LTL trucking industry, cross-docking is done by moving cargo from one transport vehicle directly onto another, with minimal or no [[warehousing]]. In retail practice, cross-docking operations may utilize staging areas where inbound materials are sorted, consolidated, and stored until the outbound shipment is complete and ready to ship.

==Advantages of retail cross-docking==
* Streamlines the supply chain, from point of origin to point of sale
* Reduces labor costs through less inventory handling
* Reduces inventory holding costs by reducing storage times and potentially eliminating the need to retain safety stock
* Products reach the distributor, and consequently the customer, faster
* Reduces or eliminates warehousing costs
* May increase available retail sales space
* Less risk of inventory handling

==Disadvantages of cross-docking==
* Potential partners may not have the necessary storage capacities
* An adequate transport fleet is needed to operate
* A computerized logistics system is needed
* Additional freight handling can lead to product damage
* Labour costs are also incurred in the moving and shipping of stock

==Typical applications==
*"[[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|Hub and spoke]]" arrangements, where materials are brought in to one central location and then sorted for delivery to a variety of destinations
*Consolidation arrangements, where a variety of smaller shipments are combined into one larger shipment for economy of transport
*Deconsolidation arrangements, where large shipments (e.g., railcar lots) are broken down into smaller lots for ease of delivery

Retail cross-dock example: using cross-docking, Wal-Mart was able to effectively leverage its logistical volume into a core strategic competency.
* Wal-Mart operates an extensive satellite network of distribution centers serviced by company-owned trucks
* Wal-Mart's satellite network sends point-of-sale (POS) data directly to 4,000 vendors.
* Each register is directly connected to a satellite system sending sales information to Wal-Mart’s headquarters and distribution centers.

==Factors influencing the use of retail cross-docks==
* Cross-docking depends on continuous communication between suppliers, distribution centers, and all points of sale
* Customer and supplier geography, particularly when a single corporate customer has many multiple branches or using points
* Freight costs for the commodities being transported
* Cost of inventory in transit
* Complexity of loads
* Handling methods
* Logistics software integration between supplier(s), vendor, and shipper
* Tracking of inventory in transit

==Cross-dock facility design==
Cross-dock facilities are generally designed in an "I" configuration, which is an elongated rectangle. The goal in using this shape is to maximize the number of inbound and outbound doors that can be added to the facility while keeping the floor area inside the facility to a minimum. Bartholdi and Gue (2004) demonstrated that this shape is ideal for facilities with 150 doors or less. For facilities with 150–200 doors, a "T" shape is more cost effective. Finally, for facilities with 200 or more doors, the cost-minimizing shape is an "X".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = John J. | last1 = Bartholdi | first2 = Kevin R. | last2 = Gue | title = The Best Shape for a Crossdock | journal = [[Transportation Science]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | date = May 2004 | pages = 235–244 | doi = 10.1287/trsc.1030.0077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2846">'''Crystal Analysis''' (a.k.a. '''Crystal Analysis Professional''') is an [[OLAP|On Line Analytical Processing]] (OLAP) [[application software| application]] for analysing business data originally developed by [[Seagate Software]].

It was first released under the name ''Seagate Analysis'' as a free application written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] released in 1999. After disappointing application performance, a decision was made to rewrite using [[Active Template Library|ATL]] [[Component Object Model|COM]] in [[C++]]. The initial rewrite only supported [[Microsoft Analysis Services]], but support for other vendors soon followed, with [[Holos]] [[OLAP cube|cubes]] in version 8.5, [[Essbase]], [[IBM DB2]] and [[SAP BW]] following in later releases. The web client was rewritten using an [[XSLT]] abstraction layer for the version 9.0 release, with better standards compliance to support [[Mozilla]] based browsers—this work also set the building blocks for support for [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].

Crystal Analysis relies on [[Crystal Enterprise]] for distribution of analytical applications created with it.

'''Customer attrition''', also known as '''customer churn''', '''customer turnover''', or '''customer defection''', is the loss of clients or customers.

[[Bank]]s, telephone service companies, [[Internet service provider]]s, [[pay TV]] companies, [[insurance]] firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] (along with [[cash flow]], [[EBITDA]], etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1990/09/zero-defections-quality-comes-to-services/ar/1 ''Zero Defections: Quality comes to service.''], Reichheld &amp; Sasser. Harvard Business review. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies from these sectors often have [[customer service]] branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.

Companies usually make a distinction between '''voluntary churn''' and '''involuntary churn'''. Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.

When companies are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make the distinction between '''gross attrition''' and '''net attrition'''. Gross attrition is the loss of existing customers and their associated [[recurring revenue]] for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called '''Recurring Monthly Revenue''' (or '''RMR''').   In the 2000s, there are also a number of [[business intelligence]] software programs which can [[data mining|mine databases]] of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated [[predictive analytics]] software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing [[customer retention]] marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.

==Retail services applications==
[[Financial services]] such as banking and insurance use applications of [[predictive analytics]] for churn modeling, because customer retention is an essential part of most financial services' [[business model]]s. Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics, including [[retail]]ing, [[telecommunications]] and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some companies want to prevent their ''good'' customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of '''partial customer churn'''.

Customer attrition merits special attention by mobile telecom service providers worldwide. This is due to the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) in several countries. This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers. While mature markets with high teledensity (phone market penetration) have [[churn rate]]s ranging from 1% to 2% per month, high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3% to 4% per month. By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs, customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers.

Customer attrition is a major concern for US and Canadian banks, because they have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe. US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12% per year, by using tactics such as free checking accounts, [[online banking]] and bill payment, and improved customer service. However, once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service, they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention; other tactics or approaches need to be explored.

Churn or Customer attrition is often used as an indicator of customer satisfaction. However the churn rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services. This can include ignoring resiliations requests, implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation. Thus, churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates. This practice is short sighted and will backfire. However, it was shown{{By whom|date=October 2017}} to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers.

==Research==
Scholars have studied customer attrition at European financial services companies, and investigated the predictors of churn and how the use of [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) approaches can impact churn rates. Several studies combine several different types of predictors to develop a churn model. This model can take [[Demography|demographic characteristics]], environmental changes, and other factors into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Customer Attrition Analysis For Financial Services Using Proportional Hazard Models | citeseerx = 10.1.1.62.8919 | author1 = Van Den Poel | author2 = Lariviére | journal = European Journal of Operational Research | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1016/s0377-2217(03)00069-9 | volume=157 | pages=196–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on customer attrition data modeling may provide businesses with several tools for enhancing customer retention. Using data mining and software, one may apply statistical methods to develop nonlinear attrition causation models. One researcher notes that "...retaining existing customers is more profitable than acquiring new customers due primarily to savings on acquisition costs, the higher volume of service consumption, and customer referrals." The argument is that to build an "...effective customer retention program," managers have to come to an understanding of "...why customers leave" and "...identify the customers with high risk of leaving" by accurately predicting customer attrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCIM/bin/get.cgi?directory=vol6_1/&amp;filename=li.html ''Applying and evaluating models to predict customer attrition using data mining techniques''], Tom Au, et al. Journal of Comparative International Management. 1 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction==
In the [[business]] context, "churn" refers both to customers' migration and to their loss of value. So, "churn rate" refers, on the one hand, to the percentage of customers who end their relation with the organization, or, on the other hand, to the customers who still receive their services, but not as much or not as often as they used to.
Current organizations face therefore a huge challenge: to be able to anticipate to customers’ abandon in order to retain them on time, reducing this way costs and risks and gaining efficiency and competitivity.
There are in the market advanced analytics tools and applications, especially designed to analyze in depth the enormous amount of data inside the organizations, and to make predictions based on the information obtained from analyzing and exploring those data. They aim to put at the service of [[marketing]] departments and agencies –and of all business users- the necessary weapons to:
* Detect soon which customers are about to abandon and to know them in depth, answering to questions such as: Who are they? or How do they behave?
* Know the real value of the potential loss of those customers, with the aim of establishing priorities and distributing business efforts and resources efficiently, optimizing resources and maximizing the value of the current customers’ portfolio.
* Put into practice personalized retention plans in order to reduce or avoid their migration, increasing the capability to react and anticipating to possible non-predicted fugues.

==Reduction==
There are organizations that have developed international standards regarding recognition and sharing of global best practice in [[customer service]] in order to reduce customer attrition. [[The International Customer Service Institute]] has developed The International Customer Service Standard to strategically align organizations so they focus on delivering excellence in customer service, whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party registration scheme.

==Management==
Not all customer attrition is bad. For many firms, it is useful and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away. This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers.&lt;ref&gt;Ka‐shing Woo, Henry K.Y. Fock, (2004) Retaining and divesting customers: an exploratory study of right customers, “at‐risk” right customers, and wrong customers. ''Journal of Services Marketing, 18'', 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, simply because a customer is unprofitable does not mean that the customer should be divested, because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers.

'''Dividing territories''' (also '''market division''') is an agreement by two companies to stay out of each other's way and reduce competition in the agreed-upon territories. The process known as geographic market allocation is one of several [[anti-competitive practices]] outlawed under [[United States antitrust law]]s. The term is generally understood to include dividing customers as well.

For example, in 1984, [[FMC Corp.]] and Asahi Chemical agreed to divide territories for the sale of [[microcrystalline cellulose]], and later FMC attempted to eliminate all vestiges of competition by inviting smaller rivals also to collude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/12/fmc.htm|title=FTC Order Settles Charges that FMC Corp. and Japan's Asahi Chemical Co.

The term '''empowerment''' refers to measures designed to increase the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities in order to enable them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources. To do work with power.

The term empowerment originates from American [[community psychology]] and is associated{{by whom|date=June 2016}} with the social scientist [[Julian Rappaport]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Julian. In praise of paradox. A social policy of empowerment over prevention, in: American Journal of Community Psychology, Vol. 9 (1), 1981, 1–25 (13)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the roots of empowerment theory extend further into history and are linked to Marxist sociological theory. These sociological ideas have continued to be developed and refined through Neo-Marxist Theory (also known as Critical Theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compsy.org.uk/rethemp.htm|title=Rethinking empowerment: shared action against powerlessness|last=Burton &amp; Kagan|first=|date=1996|website=compsy.org.uk|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social work]], empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of [[citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and [[democratic education]], empowerment is seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen. Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting [[civic engagement]]. Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a [[wikt:deficit|deficit]]-oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of [[continuing education]] and [[self-help]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Definitions==
Robert Adams points to the limitations of any single definition of 'empowerment', and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he offers a minimal definition of the term: 
'Empowerment: the capacity of individuals, groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances, exercise power and achieve their own goals, and the process by which, individually and collectively, they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

One definition for the term is "an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources".&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Empowerment Group. (1989, October). Empowerment and family support. Networking Bulletin, 1(1)2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, M.A. (2000). Empowerment Theory: Psychological, Organizational and Community Levels of Analysis. "Handbook of Community Psychology," 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappaport's (1984) definition includes: "Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, J. (1984). Studies in empowerment: Introduction to the issue. "Prevention in Human Services," 3, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological empowerment often addresses members of groups that social discrimination processes have excluded from decision-making processes through – for example – discrimination based on disability, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], ethnicity, religion, or gender. Empowerment as a methodology is also associated with [[feminism]].

==Process==
Empowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for [[marginalized]] people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, [[self-sufficiency]], with a focus on eliminating the future need for [[Charity (practice)|charity]] or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively.

===Strategy===
One empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own [[nonprofit organization]], using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. [[Red Cross]], for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility – and credit – for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).

The process of which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal or collective power, authority and influence, and to employ that strength when engaging with other people, institutions or society. In other words, "Empowerment is not giving people power, people already have plenty of power, in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation, to do their jobs magnificently. We define empowerment as letting this power out."&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt;  It encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately, help them develop within themselves or in the society.

To empower a female "...sounds as though we are dismissing or ignoring males, but the truth is, both genders desperately need to be equally empowered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=2273|title=Encouraging and Empowering Girls - Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association|date=13 July 2012|website=Ccpa-accp.ca|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empowerment occurs through improvement of conditions, standards, events, and a global perspective of life.

===Criticism===
Before there can be the finding that a particular group requires empowerment and that therefore their self-esteem needs to be consolidated on the basis of awareness of their strengths, there needs to be a deficit diagnosis usually carried out by experts assessing the problems of this group. The fundamental asymmetry of the relationship between experts and clients is usually not questioned by empowerment processes. It also needs to be regarded critically, in how far the empowerment approach is really applicable to all patients/clients. It is particularly questionable whether [[mentally ill]] people in acute crisis situations are in a position to make their own decisions. According to Albert Lenz, people behave primarily regressive in acute crisis situations and tend to leave the responsibility to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Lenz: ''Empowerment und Ressourcenaktivierung – Perspektiven für die psychosoziale Praxis.''&lt;/ref&gt; It must be assumed, therefore, that the implementation of the empowerment concept requires a minimum level of communication and reflectivity of the persons involved.

== In social work and community psychology ==
[[File:Altenheim 12.jpg|thumb|Empowerment in the work for senior citizens in a residential home in Germany]]
In [[social work]], empowerment offers an approach that allows social workers to increase the capacity for self-help of their clients. For example, this allows clients not to be seen as passive, helpless 'victims' to be rescued but instead as a self-empowered person fighting abuse/ oppression; a fight, in which the social worker takes the position of a facilitator, instead of the position of a 'rescuer'.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.12ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalized people who lack self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity, or welfare.  They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting.  The opportunities denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems. "[[Marginalized]]" here refers to the overt or covert trends within societies whereby those perceived as lacking desirable traits or deviating from the group norms tend to be excluded by wider society and ostracized as undesirables.

===In health promotion practice and research===
As a concept, and model of practice, empowerment is also used in health promotion research and practice.
The key principle is for individuals to gain increased control over factors that influence their health status &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

To empower individuals and to obtain more equity in health, it is also important to address health-related behaviors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Studies suggest that health promotion interventions aiming at empowering adolescents should enable active learning activities, use visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allow the adolescents to influence intervention activities &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmberg|first=Christopher|last2=Larsson|first2=Christel|last3=Korp|first3=Peter| last4=Lindgren|first4=Eva-Carin|last5=Jonsson|first5=Linus|last6=Fröberg|first6=Andreas|last7=Chaplin|first7=John E.|last8=Berg|first8=Christina|date=2018-07-04|title=Empowering aspects for healthy food and physical activity habits: adolescents’ experiences of a school-based intervention in a disadvantaged urban community|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being|volume=13|issue=sup 1|doi=10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In economics==
According to Robert Adams, there is a long tradition in the UK and the USA respectively to advance forms of self-help that have developed and contributed to more recent concepts of empowerment. For example, the free enterprise economic theories of [[Milton Friedman]] embraced self-help as a respectable contributor to the economy. Both the Republicans in the US and the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] built on these theories. 'At the same time, the mutual aid aspects of the concept of self-help retained some currency with socialists and democrats.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economic development]], the empowerment approach focuses on mobilizing the [[self-help]] efforts of the poor, rather than providing them with [[social welfare]]. Economic empowerment is also the empowering of previously disadvantaged sections of the population, for example, in many previously colonized African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microempowering.org |title=Welcome to MicroEmpowering! |publisher=Microempowering.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasingly engaged corporate directors===
The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has argued that large [[institutional investor]]s such as [[pension fund]]s and [[Financial endowment|endowment]]s are exercising a greater influence on the process of adding and replacing corporate directors – as they are themselves steered to do so by their own board members (pension trustees).

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as “more than ever before, many [North American], UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]]”, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal==
Legal empowerment happens when marginalised people or groups use the [[legal mobilisation]] i.e., law, legal systems and justice mechanisms to improve or transform their social, political or economic situations. Legal empowerment approaches are interested in understanding how they can use the [[law]] to advance interests and priorities of the marginalised.&lt;ref name=odi&gt;{{cite web|title=The politics of legal empowerment: legal mobilisation strategies and implications for development|url=http://www.odi.org/publications/8485-legal-empowerment-mobilisation|website=Odi.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 'Open society foundations' (an NGO)  "Legal empowerment is about [[Capacity building|strengthening the capacity]] of all people to exercise their [[rights]], either as individuals or as members of a community. Legal empowerment is about grass root justice, about ensuring that [[law]] is not confined to books or courtrooms, but rather is available and meaningful to ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/projects/legal-empowerment|title=What Is Legal Empowerment?|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenzo Cotula in his book ' ''Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control'' ' outlines the fact that [[Law|legal tools]] for securing local resource rights are enshrined in legal system, does not necessarily mean that local resource users are in position to use them and benefit from them. The [[legal system|state legal system]] is constrained by a range of different factors – from lack of resources to cultural issues. Among these factors economic, geographic, linguistic and other constraints on access to courts, ''lack of [[legal awareness]] as well as [[legal aid|legal assistance]] '' tend to be recurrent problems.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many context, marginalised groups do not trust the legal system owing to the widespread manipulation that it has historically been subjected to by the more powerful. 'To what extent one knows the [[law]], and make it work for themselves with 'para legal tools',  is legal empowerment; assisted utilizing innovative approaches like [[legal literacy]] and awareness training, broadcasting [[legal information]], conducting participatory [[legal discourse]]s, supporting local resource user in negotiating with other agencies and stake holders and to strategies combining use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] with [[advocacy]] along with media engagement, and socio [[legal mobilisation]].&lt;ref name=Cotula /&gt;

Sometimes groups are marginalized by society at large, with governments participating in the process of marginalization. [[Equal opportunity]] laws which actively oppose such marginalization, are supposed to allow empowerment to occur. These laws made it illegal to restrict access to schools and public places based on race. They can also be seen as a symptom of minorities' and [[women's empowerment]] through lobbying.

{{main|Gender empowerment|Women empowerment}}
[[Gender empowerment]] conventionally refers to the [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], which is a significant topic of discussion in regards to development and economics nowadays. It also points to approaches regarding other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context. This approach to empowerment is partly informed by [[feminism]] and employed legal empowerment by building on international [[human rights]]. Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights]] and [[International development|development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN Sustainable Development Goals]] targets gender equality and women's empowerment for the global development agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|website=Un.org|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In workplace management==
According to Thomas A. Potterfield,&lt;ref&gt;Potterfield, Thomas. "The Business of Employee Empowerment: Democracy and Ideology in the Workplace." Quorum Books, 1999, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; many organizational theorists and practitioners regard employee empowerment as one of the most important and popular [[Management fad|management concepts]] of our time.

Ciulla discusses an inverse case: that of [[Counterfeit|bogus]] empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ciulla| first = Joanne B.| chapter = Leadership and the Problem of Bogus Empowerment| editor-last = Ciulla| editor-first = Joanne B.| title = Ethics, the heart of leadership| edition = 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| publication-date = 2004| isbn = 978-0-275-98248-5| quote = [...] in many organizations, promises of empowerment are bogus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In management===
In the sphere of [[management]] and organizational theory, "empowerment" often refers loosely to processes for giving subordinates (or [[worker]]s generally) greater discretion and resources: distributing control in order to better serve both customers and the interests of employing organizations.

One account of the history of workplace empowerment in the [[United States of America|United States]] recalls the clash of management styles in railroad construction in the [[American West]] in the mid-19th century, where "traditional" hierarchical East-Coast models of control encountered individualistic pioneer workers, strongly supplemented by methods of [[efficiency]]-oriented "worker [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]" brought to the scene by [[Chinese American|Chinese]] [[coolie|laborer]]s. In this case, empowerment at the level of work [[team]]s or brigades achieved a notable (but short-lived) demonstrated superiority. See the [http://www.motivation-tools.com/workplace/history.htm views] of Robert L. Webb.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, empowerment has become a point of interest in management concepts and business administration. In this context, empowerment involves approaches that promise greater participation and integration to the employee in order to cope with their tasks as independently as possible and responsibly can. A strength-based approach known as "empowerment circle" has become an instrument of organizational development. Multidisciplinary empowerment teams aim for the development of [[quality circles]] to improve the organizational culture, strengthening the motivation and the skills of employees. The target of subjective job satisfaction of employees is pursued through flat hierarchies, participation in decisions, opening of creative effort, a positive, appreciative team culture, self-evaluation, taking responsibility (for results), more self-determination and constant further learning. The optimal use of existing potential and abilities can supposedly be better reached by satisfied and active workers. Here, [[knowledge management]] contributes significantly to implement employee participation as a guiding principle, for example through the creation of [[communities of practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2010/04/empowering-your-employees-to-e|title=Empowering Your Employees to Empower Themselves |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to ensure that the individual employee has the skills to meet their allocated responsibilities and that the company's structure sets up the right incentives for employees to reward their taking responsibilities. Otherwise there is a danger of being overwhelmed or even becoming lethargic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/1998/05/empowerment-the-emperors-new-clothes|title=Empowerment: The Emperor’s New Clothes |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for company culture===
Empowerment of employees requires a culture of trust in the organization and an appropriate information and communication system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atulhost.com/employee-empowerment|title=Employee Empowerment: The Key to Employee Satisfaction|publisher=AtulHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of these activities is to save control costs, that become redundant when employees act independently and in a self-motivated fashion. 
In the book ''Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute'', the authors illustrate three keys that organizations can use to open the knowledge, experience, and motivation power that people already have.&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt; The three keys that managers must use to empower their employees are:
# [[information sharing|Share information]] with everyone
# Create [[autonomy]] through boundaries
# Replace the old hierarchy with [[self-directed work team]]s

According to Stewart, in order to guarantee a successful work environment, managers need to exercise the "right kind of [[authority]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;6).  To summarize, "empowerment is simply the effective use of a manager’s authority", and subsequently, it is a productive way to maximize all-around work [[efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Aileen Mitchell. ''Empowering People'' (Institute of Management). Pitman. London: Financial Times Management, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

These keys are hard to put into place and it is a journey to achieve empowerment in a workplace.  It is important to [[workplace training|train]] employees and make sure they have trust in what empowerment will bring to a company.&lt;ref name=blanchard&gt;{{cite book|author1=Blanchard, Kenneth H.|author2=John P. Carlos|author3=Alan Randolph|title=Empowerment Takes More than a Minute|publisher=San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of the concept of empowerment in management has also been criticised for failing to live up to its claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2015/05/6-myths-about-empowering-employees|title=6 Myths About Empowering Employees |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Age of Popular Empowerment?==

[[Marshall McLuhan]] insisted that the development of [[electronic media]] would eventually weaken the [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures that underpin central governments, large corporation, academia and, more generally, rigid, “[[Descartes|linear-Cartsesian”]] forms of social organization.&lt;ref name="youtube1977"&gt;{{cite news|last1= McLuhan|first1=Marshall|title=‘ABC TV Monday Conference: The Medium is the Message (Part 1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImaH51F4HBw|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= ABC TV Monday Conference|publisher=ABC TV Monday Conference|date=27 June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From that perspective, new, “electronic forms of awareness” driven by [[information technology]] would empower citizen, employees and students by disseminating in [[real-time computing|near-real-time]] vast amounts of information once reserved to a small number of experts and specialists. Citizens would be bound to ask for substantially more say in the management of government affairs, production, consumption, and education &lt;ref name="youtube1977"/&gt;

[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] economist Nicolas Firzli has argued that rapidly rising cultural tides, notably new forms of online engagement and increased demands for [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-driven]] public policies and managerial decisions are transforming the way governments and corporation interact with citizen-consumers in the “Age of Empowerment” &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"/&gt;

'''Engineering Economics in Civil Engineering''', also known generally as [[engineering economics]], or alternatively [[engineering economy]], is a subset of [[economics]], more specifically, [[microeconomics]]. It is defined as a "guide for the economic selection among technically feasible alternatives for the purpose of a rational allocation of scarce resources." &lt;ref name="Lesser1969"&gt;Lesser Jr, Arthur. "Engineering economy in the United States in retrospect—An analysis." The Engineering Economist 14.2 (1969): 109-116.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its goal is to guide entities, private or public that are confronted with the [[Economic problem|fundamental problem of economics]], it wishes to accomplish more than its resources will permit. &lt;ref name="Hoffer1998"&gt;Hoffer, Stefan N. Economic analysis of investment and regulatory decisions: revised guide. 1998. Accessed at [https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/policy_guidance/benefit_cost/media/ECONOMIC.pdf] {{PD-notice}} &lt;/ref&gt;
This fundamental problem of economics consists of two fundamental questions that must be answered, namely what objectives should be investigated or explored and how should these be achieved?  Economics as a social science answers those questions and is defined as the knowledge used for selecting among “…technically feasible alternatives for the purpose of a rational allocation of scarce resources.” &lt;ref name="Lesser1969"&gt;Lesser Jr, Arthur. "Engineering economy in the United States in retrospect—An analysis." The Engineering Economist 14.2 (1969): 109-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, all problems involving "...profit maximizing or cost-minimizing are engineering problems with economic objectives
and are properly described by the label "engineering economy".&lt;ref name="Goetz1959"&gt;Billy E.  (1959) Engineering Economy—Teaching and Practice, The Engineering Economist, 5:2, 1-12, DOI: 10.1080/00137915908965083 Access at [https://doi.org/10.1080/00137915908965083]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a subdiscipline practiced by [[civil engineers]], engineering economics narrows the definition of the fundamental economic problem and related questions to that of problems related to the [[Capital (economics)|investment of capital]], public or private in a broad array of [[Infrastructure_and_economics#Planning_and_management_of_infrastructure|infrastructure projects]]. Civil engineers confront more specialized forms of the fundamental problem in the form of inadequate economic evaluation of engineering projects.
&lt;ref name="Magyar1968"&gt;Magyar, William B. "Economic Evaluation of Engineering Projects." The Engineering Economist 13.2 (1968): 67-86.&lt;/ref&gt;
Civil engineers under constant pressure to deliver infrastructure effectively and efficiently confront complex problems associated with allocating scarce resources for ensuring [[ISO 10006|quality]], [[Risk_management#Risk_options|mitigating risk]] and [[Project delivery method|controlling project delivery]]. Civil engineers must be educated to recognize the role played by engineering economics as part of the [[Infrastructure_and_economics#Economic,_social_and_environmental_impacts_of_infrastructure|evaluations]] occurring at each phase in the project lifecycle.&lt;ref name="Magyar1968"/&gt;      

Thus, the application of engineering economics in the practice of civil engineering focuses on the decision-making process, its context, and environment in project execution and delivery. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009"&gt;Dharmaraj, E.. Engineering Economics. Mumbai, IN: Himalaya Publishing House, 2009. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris1960"&gt; Morris, W. Thomas. (1960). Engineering economy: the analysis of management decisions. Homewood, Ill.: R. D. Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is pragmatic by nature, integrating microeconomic theory with civil engineering practice &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; but, it is also a simplified application of economic theory in that it avoids a number of microeconomic concepts such as [[price determination]], [[Competition#Economics_and_business|competition]] and [[supply and demand]]. 
&lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt;  
This poses new, underlying economic problems of resource allocation for civil engineers in delivering infrastructure projects and specifically, resources for project management, planning and control functions. 
{{TOC right}}
Civil engineers address these fundamental economic problems using specialized engineering economics knowledge as a framework for continuously “… probing economic feasibility…using a stage-wise approach…” throughout the project lifecycle.&lt;ref name="Magyar1968"/&gt; The application of this specialized civil engineering knowledge can be in the form of engineering analyses of [[Life-cycle cost analysis|life-cycle cost]], [[cost accounting]], [[cost of capital]] and the economic feasibility of engineering solutions for design, construction and project management. &lt;ref name="Magyar1968"/&gt; The civil engineer must have the ability to use engineering economy methodologies for the “formulation of objectives, specification of alternatives, prediction of outcomes” and estimation of minimum acceptability for investment and optimization. 
&lt;ref name="Peterson1965"&gt;George L. Peterson (1965) Toward the Improvement of The Traditional Course In Engineering Economy Through Unification As Applied Decision Theory, The Engineering Economist, 10:4, 17-31, DOI: 10.1080/00137916508928726 &lt;/ref&gt;
They must also be capable of integrating these economic considerations into appropriate [[Engineering design process|engineering solutions]] and [[Project plan|management plans]] that predictably and reliably meet [[project stakeholder]] expectations in a [[Sustainable design|sustainable manner]].     

The civil engineering profession provides a special function in our society and economy where investing substantial sums of funding in public infrastructure requires "...some assurance that it will perform its intended function." 
&lt;ref name="Dingwall2016"&gt;Dingwall, Robert. Essays on professions. Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the civil engineer exercising their professional judgment in making decisions about fundamental problems relies upon the profession’s knowledge of engineering economics to provide "the practical certainty" that makes the social investment in public infrastructure feasible. &lt;ref name="Dingwall2016"/&gt;   

==Course of Instruction==

[[Small and Medium Enterprises]] (SMEs) are defined by the [[European Commission]] as having less than 250 employees, independent (with no shareholder having over a 25% stake in the business) and with an annual turnover of no more than €50 million or annual balance sheet of €43 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs): SME Definition|url=http://ec.europa.ec/enterprise/politices/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to pursue [[eco-efficiency|eco-efficient]] measures has often been attributed to low levels of awareness and lack of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petts|first=Judith|author2=Herd Andrew |author3=Gerrard Simon |author4=Horne Chris |title=The climate and culture of environmental compliance within SMEs|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|year=1999|volume=8|issue=1|pages=14–30|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0836(199901/02)8:1&lt;14::aid-bse175&gt;3.0.co;2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that as the majority of SMEs serve local markets they are less likely to be exposed to international pressures or incentives, including those likely to promote [[eco-innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Del Brío|first=Jesús|author2=Junquera Beatriz|title=A review of the literature on environmental innovation management in SMEs: implications for public policies|journal=Technovation|year=2003|volume=23|issue=12|pages=939–948|doi=10.1016/s0166-4972(02)00036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that [[civil society]] has less concern for smaller firms’ actions, being more likely to direct their concern towards larger organisations which are seen to have the biggest impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=David|author2=Lynch-Wood Gary|title=Drivers of environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs and implications for CSR|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the 1980s and 1990s saw a shift in the perceived relationship between the [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[business practice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidheiny|first=Stephan|title=Changing Course: A Global Business Perspective on Development and the Environment|year=1992|publisher=MIT Press|location=Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it has only translated into actions for prominently large firms. This change in environmental [[business ethics]] stems mainly from ideas of ‘[[ecological modernisation]]', a school of thought advanced most notably by German scholars [[Joseph Huber (economist)|Joseph Huber]] and Martin Janicke. They challenged Max Weber’s theory of bureaucratic rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|year=1968|publisher=Bedminister Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theory which positions [[government]] as best placed to resolve [[environmental problems]].  Instead, the [[discourse]] of [[ecological modernisation]] claims that sufficient innovative capacity will come only from industry itself as it has the expertise and means to do so. This is posited with the idea of ‘steering’ industry onto more environmentally beneficial pathways through financial incentives.

This shift is clearly visible in the 1980 World Conservation Strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UCN, UNEP &amp; WWF|title=World ConservationStrategy|year=1980|publisher=(Gland, International Union for the Conservation of Nature)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which pushes environmental actions from reactive to anticipatory. The shift towards thinking in terms of ‘[[ecological modernisation]]’ has also involved a movement to ‘smart’ regulatory instruments involving more reflexive forms of law (law which pushes businesses to reflect on  and regulate their own practices) such as [[Environmental Management System]]s, Environmental Reporting and Disclosure Strategies, Market-Based Instruments and the social license. The latter of these being important in Corporate Social Responsibility.

Whilst ‘smart’ [[regulation]] is a promising concept, [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]] have been slow on the uptake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillary|first=Ruth|title=Environmental Management Systems and the smaller enterprise|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2004|volume=12|issue=6|pages=561–569|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2003.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have generally been observed to retain a reactive approach to positive environmental actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Del Brío|first=Jesús|author2=Junquera Beatriz|title=A review of the literature on environmental innovation management in SMEs: implications for public policies|journal=Technovation|year=2003|volume=23|issue=12|pages=939–948|doi=10.1016/s0166-4972(02)00036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has often suggested that a more comprehensive approach will be needed to improve environmental performance in the SME sector,&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Ole Erik|last2=S⊘nderga˚rd |first2=Bent|last3=Meredith |first3=Sandra|title=Environmental innovations in Small and Medium Sized Enterprises|journal=Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management|year=2002|volume=14|issue=1|pages=37–56|doi=10.1080/09537320220125874}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are based on three distinct theoretical perspectives;

* The strategic perspective highlights the importance of the way in which environmental issues are communicated and perceived by actors involved with SME [[governance]].
* The network perspective advances improving the environment from which SMEs obtain knowledge relating to new [[technological innovation]]s and;
* The internal competence perspective underlines a need to build the receptive capacity of SMEs in adjusting to new technological innovation.

==Structural issues==

It has been suggested that there is not yet a substantial structure in the [[UK]] which forces environmental matters onto the business agendas of UK SMEs. The choice of policy instruments in the UK has tended not to acknowledge the structural differences between large firms and [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]. For example, the EU White Paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Europa|title=White Papers|url=http://europa.eu/documentation/official-docs/white-papers/index_en.htm|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has often promoted a sectoral and ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to addressing the environmental impacts of business activities. Although acknowledging structural differences between industries is important, this distinction alone may undermine the recognition of important differences in large corporations and SMEs that may affect the way in which environmental issues are perceived or acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=Allan|title=Small firms’ training and competitiveness: building upon the small business as a learning organisation|journal=International Small Business Journal|year=1997|volume=15|issue=3|pages=13–29|doi=10.1177/0266242697153001}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to policy action, the White Paper has influenced the creation of ‘sectoral sustainability strategies’, voluntary conglomerates of firm representatives from specific industrial sectors. Such associations have been criticised for being unrepresentative of the interests due to the unequal power relations between large and small firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=Allan|title=Small firms’ training and competitiveness: building upon the small business as a learning organisation|journal=International Small Business Journal|year=1997|volume=15|issue=3|pages=13–29|doi=10.1177/0266242697153001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMEs are also perceived to often lack characteristics that would otherwise enable them to engage effectively with the [[sustainable development]] agenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petts|first=Judith|author2=Herd Andrew |author3=Gerrard Simon |author4=Horne Chris |title=The climate and culture of environmental compliance within SMEs|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|year=1999|volume=8|issue=1|pages=14–30|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0836(199901/02)8:1&lt;14::aid-bse175&gt;3.0.co;2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; barriers for effective engagement being both internal and external to the firm. It is thought that a lack of institutional enfranchisement of SMEs in the [[UK]] is also a key factor in understanding why [[environmental policies]] may be ineffective at encouraging proactive environmental performance within smaller firms.

==Corporate social responsibility==

Whilst [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] strategies have been intensively adopted by large and publicly visible corporations, the effectiveness of this type of social regulation with [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]] remains questionable. This is partly due to their size, as their smaller-scale activities are less visible within society. It is thought that many larger firms develop CSR strategies voluntarily to avoid disclosure for bad practice and to maintain and develop a [[shareholder]] base. Small firms however are not subject to the same incentives for practicing CSR. This is because they are defined by a limited [[shareholder]] base&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs): SME Definition|url=http://ec.europa.ec/enterprise/politices/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are unlikely to exhibit environmental and social bad practice on a scale worthy of media attention. These ideas are exemplified in a study by Lynch-Wood and Williamson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=David|author2=Lynch-Wood Gary|title=Drivers of environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs and implications for CSR|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has suggested that SME environmental practice is driven by ‘business performance’ and ‘[[regulation]]’, rather than the ‘business case’ (i.e. maintaining and improving shareholder base)  which CSR practice stems from. It is also apparent that smaller firms may not have the available financial resources for pursuing costly CSR strategies (CSR programmes typically involving funding community projects).

Voluntary measures as a whole have been problematized by some scholars with a suggestion that environmental practice in SMEs is often constrained by free-market decision-making frames that encourage [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] to the detriment of beyond compliance social and environmental behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=Allan|title=Small firms’ training and competitiveness: building upon the small business as a learning organisation|journal=International Small Business Journal|year=1997|volume=15|issue=3|pages=13–29|doi=10.1177/0266242697153001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental management systems==

[[Environmental Management System|Environmental Management Systems (EMS)]] such as [[ISO 14001]] and [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]] seek to provide all businesses (regardless of size and [[industry]]) with the means to develop systematic approaches to improving environmental performance. [[ISO 14001]] was purportedly written with the chipshop owner in mind so as to defend its use across the entire EU business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillary|first=Ruth|title=An Assessment of the Implementation Status of Council Regulation (No 1836/93) Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) in the European Union Member States (AIMS-EMAS)|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/emas|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst EMS is supposed to be suited for SME use, rates of uptake have been marginal. It is estimated that in 1999 only 24% of [[UK]] [[businesses]] registered with EMAS were SMEs, whilst no figures are available for [[ISO 14001]] based on company size&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillary|first=Ruth|title=An Assessment of the Implementation Status of Council Regulation (No 1836/93) Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) in the European Union Member States (AIMS-EMAS)|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/emas|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most promoted incentive for businesses implementing EMS is generally cost-savings. A pan-EU survey of businesses using EMAS identified that cost-savings were indeed the biggest perceived benefit to arise from implementation across [[Business|enterprises]] in [[Europe]] however SMEs placed this second claiming EMAS mainly benefited corporate image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillary|first=Ruth|title=Environmental Management Systems and the smaller enterprise|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2004|volume=12|issue=6|pages=561–569|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2003.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst [[ISO 14001]] was designed with the chip shop man in mind, the requirements of EMS should not be underestimated. The ISO 14001 follows a basic structure requiring business to define an [[environmental policy]], environmental aspects register (detailing applicable environmental legislation) and annually reviewed objectives and targets (in reference to environmental aspects). Without support or training, these elements can be difficult to understand. ISO 14001 requires [[internal auditing]](on an annual basis) meaning extra constraints such as time dedicated to staff training (as it cannot be undertaken by the individual responsible for overseeing the management system). Certification and Validation are expensive and SMEs especially may require support from consultants, further adding to costs.

Whilst these financial burdens may have minimal impact on larger corporations, for smaller firms the costs of implementation and upkeep may out-weigh the cost savings achieved through the EMS. If SMEs are to pursue EMS it is likely to be a result of [[supply chain]] pressure rather than ideas of financial gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=David|author2=Lynch-Wood Gary|title=Drivers of environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs and implications for CSR|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental innovation==

The diffusion of cleaner technologies and [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] (i.e. through the use of EMS) has been limited in the SME sector. This is thought to offer a key challenge to policy makers as [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]] lack sufficient network relations.&lt;ref name=Hansen /&gt; A lack of resources often entails that the firm will only participate in limited network activities for example with only one prominent customer or supplier. This limited network activity limits the scope for transferring information on [[technological innovation]]s.

==Changing legislation==

More recently structural problems regarding SME [[governance]] have been recognised by the [[European Union]]. In June 2008 the ‘[[Small Business Act for Europe|Small Business Act]]’ (SBA) for Europe was adopted. The act seeks to promote a greater range of incentives for SME good practice with the aim of bringing the sector in line with the [[sustainable development]] agenda.

Principle 9 ‘Turning environmental challenges into opportunities’ is seen as pivotal in steering SMEs onto more environmentally active pathways.  In line with this principle several member states have provided energy efficiency funding either through subsidies or encouraging loan conditions as well as varying degrees of cost-free consultancy support to SMEs.

The SBA review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SBA review: what has been done and what is to be done for European SMEs|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/11/109&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=fr|publisher=Europa|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  invites [[member states]] to use an "SME test" to assess whether disproportionate effects will be realised in relation to enterprise size. It has also been recognised that greater regulatory incentives need to be given for SMEs to adopt [[ISO 14001]] or [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]]. The review paper sets out to provide greater networking support to SMEs. It is theorised that by facilitating the use of networks it will be possible for information resources regarding [[eco-innovation]]s to be transferred across a broader array of firms, including those from the SME sector.&lt;ref name=Hansen /&gt; The  SBA review also recognises that ‘whilst SMEs have some market incentives to optimise their resource use, in many cases the market signals are not easy to identify’ they also state that ‘SMEs face challenges of limited information, time and human and financial resources’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SBA review: what has been done and what is to be done for European SMEs|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/11/109&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=fr|publisher=Europa|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that to overcome these challenges it will be necessary to develop incentives such as financial assistance. It is said that the Enterprise Europe Network will provide incentives for good environmental practice by offering assistance to SMEs marketing products and services resulting from best practice, particularly those adopting [[Low-carbon economy|low carbon technologies]].

Although the aims of the [[Small Business Act for Europe|SBA]] for [[Europe]] are seen as necessary for catalysing positive change in the environmental business performance of the SME sector it is not legally binding.

When creating a [[contract]], a negotiator is not only doing so to reach an agreement between two or more parties, but to create an agreement that is durable; whereby parties of the contract are legally bound and committed to its promises (Wade and Honeyman 2005, 7). A legally binding contract is defined as an exchange of promises or an agreement between parties that the law will enforce, and there is an underlying presumption for commercial agreements that parties ''intend'' to be legally bound (Contracts 2007).

In order to be a legally binding contract, most contracts must contain two elements:
 • All parties must agree about an offer made by one party and accepted by the other.
 • Something of value must be exchanged for something else of value. This can include goods, cash, services, or a pledge to exchange these items.
 
In addition, certain contracts are required by state law to be in writing (real estate transactions, for example), while others are not.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/contract-law-%E2%80%93-how-create-legally-binding-contract&lt;/ref&gt;

Wade and Honeyman (2007, 7) describe a ‘durable’ contract as one in which all parties substantially perform without abandonment and without resorting to legal proceedings. With only anecdotal evidence, it is difficult to know what percentages of contracts are in fact breached. It is probable that the statistics vary greatly over differing class, culture, wealth and type of transaction (Wade and Honeyman 2005, 7). The reasons for a [[breach of contract]] are also varying, and ethical issues can emerge in some situations.

Some ethical considerations which may become apparent in the durability of contracts are [[cultural relativism]] and [[moral relativism]].

Grace and Cohen (2005, 200) describe cultural relativism as the extent to which different societies and cultures have different values and ethical standards in the fields of business and organisational life. Those who embrace cultural relativism believe that all beliefs (religious, ethical, aesthetic, and political) are relative to the individual within a culture. Types of relativism include moral (where ethics depend on the social assembly), situational (where right or wrong is dependent on the situation), and cognitive (where truth itself has no objective standard). The legislative system is having a harder time defining laws with the diminishing set of standards, and our court system is having a harder time interpreting them (Cultural Relativism – Illogical Standard 2006).

Moral relativism views ethical standards, morality, and positions of right or wrong as being culturally based. This therefore subjects these views as being an individual’s choice. While modern society was previously governed by a "Judeo-Christian" standard, this view has increasingly been acknowledged as the chief moral philosophy of modern society (Moral Relativism – Neutral Thinking?. 2006). However, these "Judeo-Christian" standards continue to be the foundation for civil law, as most people believe that right and wrong are not absolutes, but are determined by the individual.

Following are reasons for breaches in contracts and the way in which these ethical considerations may impact upon them. In most of these situations, the law may not agree with moral or cultural relativism and award in favour of what people generally view as being ‘right’ or ‘wrong’. It is therefore imperative that contracts are created to be as durable as possible so parties are unable to find legal ‘loopholes’ and use their power, wealth, ignorance or cultural differences in setting contracts aside. Following these descriptions is a list of ways on which contracts can be made more durable.

==Cultural Expectations of Flexibility==

In some cultural groups such as Japan, the creation of a contract symbolises the formation of a working relationship, and not a legally binding agreement. Some groups will regard the contract as being flexible in terms that if any problems or issues arise, the parties will reassess the obligations of the agreement and negotiate ways to preserve the relationship (Honeyman and Wade 2007, 8). However, this is not generally the ‘Western’ view on contracts.

In relation to the ethical issue of cultural relativism, a business is obliged to operate in a manner acceptable to the host country, both legally and morally (Grace and Cohen 2005, 19). But what if the contract is not necessarily subject to having a ‘host country’? Is it morally wrong for a Western party to hold a Japanese party to the contract when it is known that the Japanese party would not have intended to be legally bound? Or is it unethical or immoral of the Japanese to sign such an agreement, even though they mean well when signing it, knowing the Western party intended to be legally bound by the contract but themselves see the contract as more of a flexible agreement?

Honeyman and Wade (2007) state that differences in cultural expectations can predictably lead to the more economically powerful party attempting to negotiate that all breaches will be dealt with ultimately by courts from their own culture, applying their own cultural and legal rules.

This then highlights the issue of different legal rules existing in different countries which enable contracts to be set aside. The list of exceptions to finality of contracts varies from one jurisdiction to another, and this is often placed under the label ‘frustration of contracts’.

==Lack of Informed Consent==

Some acts cannot legally take place because of a lack of [[informed consent]]. This can occur under conditions of pressures of limited time, money, exhaustion and exhortations to settle from lawyers. Another person is generally authorised to give consent if an individual is unable to. These cases sometimes result in a party refusing to comply with the terms of the contract; however, they are rarely successful as a defense to an enforcement action. Judges usually take the view that a client advised by a lawyer is strongly presumed both to have a basic understanding of legal principle, and to have given consent (Informed Consent 2007). This was the case in ''Gerbert and Gerbert'' (1990) FLC 92-137, where a husband settled for 10% of assets against his probable entitlement to 40%, and it was held that there was no miscarriage of justice as the husband acted freely and was advised to seek legal advice. In cases where an individual is provided limited facts, serious ethical issues may arise.

Is it ethical to hold someone to a contract when they clearly had no awareness of exactly what they were signing and committing themselves to, due to ignorance or not? Is it ethical for a lawyer to encourage the signing of a document if they are clearly not fully understanding of the document?

==Wealth==

If the chance of success and money is opportune to a wealthy person, their capacity and willingness can give rise to alleging various legal justifications for breach. A few years of legal expenses may only be a small proportion of their empire, and the resulting attrition and disparate investment in the conflict may eventually encourage other parties to renegotiate the disputed clauses (Honeyman and Wade 2005, 15).

In terms of moral relativism, most people would agree that it is ethically wrong to use wealth to control a situation and to ‘force’ people into renegotiating clauses in contracts if they are unable to afford the legal bill accompanying a dispute. However, as moral relativism is subject to a one’s own beliefs on what is right and wrong, some may not view using wealth as a means to control as being the wrong thing to do. In situations such as these, the ‘little man’ usually loses out and will ultimately succumb to the power of the other party or parties.

==Undue Influence==

[[Undue influence]] is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another. The law presumes that in certain classes of relationship there will be a special risk of one party unduly influencing their conduct and motives for contracting (Undue Influence 2007). Because the court can vitiate such a contract if there is a special relationship, when no special relationship exists, the general rule is whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1936|litigants=[[Johnson v Buttress]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.pdf (1936) 56 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 113] |courtname=auto |date=17 August 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such a case is ''Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School District'' CA Ct of App 54 Ca Rpt 533 [1964]. The plaintiff was under contract as a teacher.  He was arrested, and the next day he allegedly was pressured by his superiors to sign and deliver his resignation.  He was cleared of the criminal charges, and then he sought to be reinstated by the school district.  They refused, so he sued to rescind his resignation.  He claimed that his resignation should not be enforced because, among other things, he signed it under the "undue influence" of his superiors.

When a party has placed their confidence and trust in another and this relationship is broken, the view of moral relativism will generally see this situation as being wrong. Undue influence is usually an act of dishonesty and/or deceit in a situation where one party realizes their power over the other and takes advantage of this. Deception and deceit are not viewed as being ethical values inherent in a person.

==Increasing the Durability of Contracts==

As Honeyman and Wade (2005, 15) point out, to increase the chances of ‘performance’ of a contract (and therefore reduce chances of a breach), a party should enhance:

*Entering into contracts with parties where there is already a longstanding relationship – therefore raising incentives to perform promises
*Avoiding making contracts with cultural groups that view contracts as the ‘beginning of a relationship’, rather than a legally binding agreement
*Clarifying whether ‘yes’ means ‘maybe’ or ‘no’ and whether signed and detailed contracts are considered to be binding, morally, legally and/or in reputation, or just amount to the declaration that a working relationship now exists
*Including clauses and a discussion regarding how any future misunderstandings and problems will be addressed
*Attempting to agree that final determination of any future problems with performance will be in a court or arbitration venue
*Only going into contract with parties that are stable and reliable
*Taking out [[risk management]] insurance for non-performance or currency fluctuations
*Attempting to enter into an agreement which recognizes procedural, emotional and substantive needs of all parties involved
*Not walking close to the line on any of the legal rules such as [[duress]], [[deceit]], vague terminology or illegality and this will give other parties the opportunity to claim a loophole
*Attempting to reduce buyer’s remorse by
**Making congratulatory speeches about the agreement’s benefits
**Never agreeing quickly to any clauses
**Adding post-agreement gifts and bonuses
**Publicize the deal by mutual agreement. A wider audience will then place expectations on all parties to perform, or risk losing face and credibility in future arrangements. Most people have a strong desire to act consistently with their own clear commitment

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1834">'''Forged endorsement''' is a legal term used to describe a fraudulent payment. For example, someone may write a cheque with a forged signature. In this case the forged signature makes the endorsement fraudulent. Forging endorsements can be use to prevent the person or legal entity that the payment is made out to from being able to receive its value (such as cashing a cheque).

==Legal description==

If an [[Financial instrument|instrument]] is endorsed in full, it cannot be endorsed or negotiated except by an [[Negotiable instrument|endorsement]] signed by the person to whom or to whose order the instrument is payable. Thus, if such an instrument is negotiated by way of a forged endorsement, the endorsee will not acquire the title even though he be a purchaser for value and in good faith, because the endorsement is [[Legal nullity|nullity]]. But where the instrument has been endorsed in blank, it can be negotiated by mere delivery and the holder derives his title independent of the forged endorsement and can claim the amount from any of the parties to the instrument.

== Examples==
A bill is endorsed, “payable to X or order”. X endorses it in blank and it comes into the hands of Y, who simply delivers it to A. A would then forge Y's endorsement and transfers it to B. B, as the holder, does not derive his title through the forged endorsement to Y, but through the genuine endorsement of X and can claim payment from any of the parties to the instrument in spite of the intervening forged endorsement.

Most textbooks date the establishment of the "Publicity Bureau" in 1900 as the start of the modern [[public relations]] (PR) profession. Of course, there were many early forms of public influence and communications management in history. Basil Clarke is considered the founder of the public relations profession in Britain with his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924. Academic Noel Turnball points out that systematic PR was employed in Britain first by religious evangelicals and Victorian reformers, especially opponents of slavery. In each case the early promoters focused on their particular movement and were not for hire more generally.

[[Propaganda]] was used by both sides to rally domestic support and demonize enemies during the First World War. PR activists entered the private sector in the 1920s. Public relations became established first in the US by [[Ivy Lee]] or [[Edward Bernays]], then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe after 1948 when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the [[Marshall plan]].

The second half of the twentieth century was the professional development building era of public relations. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. [[The Cluetrain Manifesto]], which predicted the impact of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.

Explorers like [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[kelvin kasiwulaya and Talent Gonsalo]] used exaggerated claims of grandeur to entice settlers to come to the [[New World]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; For example, in 1598, a desolate swampy area of Virginia was described by Captain [[Arthur Barlowe]] as follows: "The soil is the most plentiful, sweet, fruitful and wholesome of all the world."&lt;ref name="barbara"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Diggs-Brown|title=Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice, 1st ed.: An Audience-focused Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC|date=May 15, 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-534-63706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="antec"/&gt; When colonists wrote back to Europe about the hardships of colonizing [[Virginia]], including the death toll caused by conflicts with Indians, pamphlets with anonymous authors were circulated to reassure potential settlers and rebuke criticisms.&lt;ref name="antec"/&gt;

Author Marvin Olasky said public relations in the 1800s was spontaneous and de-centralized.&lt;ref name="latest"/&gt; In the 1820s, Americans wanted to disprove the perspective of French aristocrats that the American democracy run by "the mob" had "no sense of history, no sense of gratitude to those who had served it, and no sense of the meaning of 'virtue'". To combat this perception, French aristocrat [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], who helped fund the [[American Revolution]], was invited to a tour of the United States.

In the 1860s, the major railway companies building the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] ([[Central Pacific Railroad]] in Sacramento, California, and the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in New York City) engaged in "sophisticated and systematic corporate public relations" in order to raise $125 million needed to construct the 1,776-mile-long railroad. To raise the money, the companies needed to maintain "an image attractive to potential bond buyers, [and maintain relationships] with members of Congress, the California state legislature, and federal regulators; with workers and potential workers; and with journalists."&lt;ref&gt;Leland K.

==Origins as a profession==
The book ''Today's Public Relations: An Introduction'' says that, although experts disagree on public relations' origins, many identify the early 1900s as its beginning as a paid profession.&lt;ref name="Heath2006"/&gt; According to Barbara Diggs-Brown, an academic with the [[American University School of Communication]], the PR field anchors its work in historical events in order to improve its perceived validity, but it didn't begin as a professional field until around 1900.&lt;ref name="barbara" /&gt; [[Scott Cutlip]] said, "we somewhat arbitrarily place the beginnings of the public relations vocation with the establishment of The Publicity Bureau in Boston in mid-1900." He explains that the origins of PR cannot be pinpointed to an exact date, because it developed over time through a series of events.&lt;ref name="cutliptwo"/&gt; Most textbooks on public relations say that it was first developed in the United States, before expanding globally;&lt;ref name="L'Etang2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacquie|last=L'Etang|title=Public Relations in Britain: A History of Professional Practice in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEuTTo4lpTYC|accessdate=May 22, 2013|date=September 2, 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-4106-1081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Jacquie L'Etang, an academic from the United Kingdom, said it was developed in the UK and the US simultaneously.&lt;ref name="L'Etang2004"/&gt; Noel Turnball claims it began as a professional field in the 18th and 19th century with British evangelicals and Victorian reformers.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt; According to academic Betteke Van Ruler, PR activities didn't begin in [[Continental Europe]] as a professional field until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="RulerVerčič2004" /&gt;

Bernays persuaded fashion designers, charity events, interior designers and others to popularize the color green.&lt;ref name="Heath2006"/&gt; He also positioned cigarettes as [[Torches of Freedom]] that represent rebellion against the norms of a male-dominated society.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diggs-Brown|title=Strategic Public Relations: An Audience-focused Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=May 21, 2013|date=August 11, 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-534-63706-4|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ruth Edgett from [[Syracuse University]], Lee and Bernays both had "initial and spectacular successes in raising PR from the art of the snake oil salesman to the calling for a true communicator." However, "late in their careers, both Lee and Bernays took on clients with clearly reprehensible values, thus exposing themselves and their work to public criticism."&lt;ref name="ruth"&gt;{{citation|title=Toward an Ethical Framework for Advocacy in Public Relations|url=http://truty.org/PDFs/PR/%28PR%29TowardAnEthicalFrameworkForAdvocacy.pdf|publisher=Journal of Public Relations|year=2002|first=Ruth|last=Edgett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Lippmann]] was also a contributor to early PR theory, for his work on the books ''Public Opinion'' (1922) and ''The Phantom Public'' (1925).

[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] were the first Presidents to emphasize the use of publicity.&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; In the 1930s Roosevelt used the media to promote [[The New Deal]] and to blame corporations for the country's economic problems.

In 1938, amid concerns regarding dropping diamond prices and sales volume, [[De Beers]] and its advertising agency N.W.

This became known as one of America's "lexicon of great campaigns" for successfully persuading the public to purchase expensive luxury items during a time of financial stress through [[psychological manipulation]].

One week after the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] established the US propaganda agency, the [[Committee on Public Information]] (Creel Commission),&lt;ref name="Ewen2008"/&gt; as an alternative to demands for media censorship by the US army and navy.&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; The CPI spread positive messages to present an upbeat image about the war and denied fraudulent atrocities made up to incite anger for the enemy.&lt;ref name = "Image"&gt;{{cite book| last =Creel| first= George| year= 1947| title =Rebel at Large: Recollections of Fifty Crowded Years| publisher= G.P.

As a result of World War I propaganda, there was a shift in PR theory from a focus on factual argumentation to one of emotional appeals and the psychology of the crowd.&lt;ref name="Ewen2008"/&gt; The term "propaganda" which was originally associated with religion and the church, became a more widely known concept.&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt;

===World War II===
Propaganda did not develop a negative connotation until it was used in [[Nazi propaganda]] for World War II.&lt;ref name="Welch 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Welch|first=David|title=The Third Reich: Politics and Propaganda|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1993|isbn=0-203-93014-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Germany's World War I propaganda was considered more advanced than that of other nations, [[Adolf Hitler]] said that propaganda had been under-utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was the main reason for losing the war.&lt;ref name="Welch 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Welch2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Welch|title=Germany, Propaganda and Total War, 1914–1918: The Sins of Omission|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_0od97nsRcC|year=2000|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2798-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hitler, Adolf. ''Mein Kampf''.

According to historian [[Zbyněk Zeman]], broadcasting became the most important medium for propaganda throughout the war. Posters were also used domestically and leaflets were dropped behind enemy lines by air-ship.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt; In regions conquered by Germany, citizens could be punished by death for listening to foreign broadcasts. Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

In countries where citizens are subordinate to the government, aggressive propaganda campaigns continued during peace-time, while liberal democratic nations primarily use propaganda techniques to support war efforts.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

==Professional development==
According to historian Eric Goldman, by the 1940s public relations was being taught at universities and was a professional occupation relied on in a similar way as lawyers and doctors. However, it failed to obtain complete recognition as a profession due in part to a history of deceit.&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; Author Marvin Olasky said in 1987 that the reputation of the profession was getting worse,&lt;ref name="latest"&gt;{{cite book

Heath from the [[University of Houston]] said in 1991 that it was progressing toward "true professional status."&lt;ref name="Heath1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heath|first1=Robert L.|title=Public relations research and education: Agendas for the 1990s|journal=Public Relations Review|volume=17|issue=2|year=1991|pages=185–194|issn=0363-8111|doi=10.1016/0363-8111(91)90055-P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic J. A. R. Pimlott said it had achieved "quasi-professionalism."&lt;ref name="HeathToth2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert L. Heath|author2=Elizabeth L. Toth|author3=Damion Waymer|title=Rhetorical and Critical Approaches to Public Relations II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaDmVGkq9NMC&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=July 27, 2013|date=February 18, 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-87492-9|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heath said despite the field's newfound professionalism and ethics, its reputation was still effected by a history of exploitive behavior.&lt;ref name="Heath2006"/&gt;

The number of media outlets increased and PR talent from wartime propaganda entered the private sector.&lt;ref name="Watson2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgraw"&gt;{{citation|title=Public Relations: The Profession and the Practice|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073512052/930653/Chapter_2.pdf|publisher=McGraw Hill|accessdate=August 6, 2014|first1=Dan|last1=Lattimore|first2=Otis|last2=Baskin|first3=Suzette|last3=Heiman|first4=Elizabeth|last4=Toth|first5=James|last5=Van Leuven}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of public relations became ubiquitous to reach political, activist and corporate objectives. The development of the press into a more real-time media also led to heightened scrutiny of public relations activities and those they represent. For example, [[Richard Nixon]] was criticized for "doubletalk" and "stonewalling" in his PR office's responses to the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name="managementt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crable|first=Richard|author2=Steven Vibbert|title=Public Relations as Communication Management|publisher=Bellwether Press|year=1986|isbn=0-8087-4878-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade associations were formed first in the U.S. in 1947 with the [[Public Relations Society of America]] (PRSA), followed by the Institute of Public Relations (now the [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]]) in London in 1948. Similar trade associations were created in Australia, Europe, South Africa, Italy and Singapore. The International Association of Public Relations was founded in 1955.&lt;ref name="Heath2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated53"/&gt; The Institute for Public Relations held its first conference in 1949 and that same year the first British book on PR, "Public Relations and publicity" was published by J.H. Brebner.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The evolution of evaluation|first=Tom|last=Watson|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/19076/1/Watson_%282011%29_The_evolution_of_evaluation_%28IHPRC%29.pdf|publisher=Bournemouth University|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Association of Business Communicators]] was founded in 1970.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"/&gt; Betsy Ann Plank is called "the first lady of public relations" for becoming the first female president of the PRSA in 1973.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"/&gt;

Two of today's largest PR firms, [[Edelman]] and [[Burson-Marsteller]], were founded in 1952 and 1953 respectively.&lt;ref name="SrirameshVercic2012"/&gt; [[Daniel Edelman]] created the first media tour&lt;ref name="SrirameshVercic2012"/&gt; in the 1950s by touring the country with "the Toni Twins," where one had used a professional salon and the other had used Toni's home-care products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Miller|title=Public-Relations Pioneer Began with 'Toni Twins' Stunt|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324235104578244253082298248|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dan Edelman, 1920–2013|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-16/news/ct-met-edelman-obit-0116-20130116_1_largest-pr-firm-richard-edelman-chicago-firm|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 16, 2013|first=Robert|last=Channick|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during this period that trade magazines like ''[[PR Week]]'', ''Ragans'' and ''PRNews'' were founded.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"/&gt; John Hill, founder of [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]], is known as the first international PR pioneer.&lt;ref name="SrirameshVercic2012"/&gt; Hill &amp; Knowlton was the first major U.S. firm to create a strong international network in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="MorrisGoldsworthy2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trevor Morris|author2=Simon Goldsworthy|title=PR Today: The Authoritative Guide to Public Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAWREYOZYhQC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=July 25, 2013|date=November 23, 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-24009-4|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Edelman and Burson-Marsteller followed Hill &amp; Knowlton by establishing operations in London in the 1960s and all three began competing internationally in Asia, Europe and other regions.&lt;ref name="SrirameshVercic2012"/&gt; Jacques Coup de Frejac was influential in persuading U.S. and UK companies to also extend their PR efforts into the French market and for convincing French businesses to engage in PR activities.&lt;ref name="SrirameshVercic2012"/&gt; In the early 2000s, PR in Latin America began developing at a pace "on par with industrialized nations."&lt;ref name="FreitagStokes2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alan R.

According to ''The Global Public Relations Handbook'', public relations evolved from a series of "press agents or publicists" to a manner of theory and practice in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="SrirameshVercic2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Krishnamurthy Sriramesh|author2=Dejan Vercic|title=The Global Public Relations Handbook, Revised Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOT7RlW1CzoC&amp;pg=PT994|accessdate=July 25, 2013|date=September 10, 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-84554-4|page=994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was published in academic journals like ''Public Relations Review'' and the ''Journal of Public Relations Research''. This led to an industry consensus to categorize PR work into a four-step process: research, planning, communication and action.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"/&gt;

==Social and digital==
During the 1990s specialties for communicating to certain audiences and within certain market segments emerged, such as investor relations or technology PR.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"/&gt; New internet technology and social media websites effected PR strategies and tactics.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"/&gt; In April 1999, four managers from [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[National Public Radio]] and [[Linux Journal]] created "[[The Cluetrain Manifesto]]." The Manifesto established 95 theses about the way social media and internet technologies were going to change business. It concluded that markets had become "smarter and faster than most companies," because stakeholders were getting information from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Medill Department of Integrated Communications|first=Randy|last=Hlavac|last2=Schaefer|first2=Mark |title=The Social Media Revolution as Theorized by "The Cluetrain Manifesto"|url=http://jimc.medill.northwestern.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/02/archives/2013/JIMC_Current_Issue_2013_Article_5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Tamar|last=Weinberg|title=The New Community Rules: Marketing on the Social Web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wfk_HzC7bS8C&amp;pg=PA63|date=July 1, 2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-7928-5|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifesto "created a storm" with strong detractors and supporters.&lt;ref name="Sheldrake2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Sheldrake|title=The Business of Influence: Reframing Marketing and PR for the Digital Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8xeQR6qatoC|date=May 4, 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-97830-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Seth Godin]] published a book on [[permission marketing]], which advocated against advertising and in favor of marketing that is useful and educational.&lt;ref name="Sheldrake2011"/&gt; While initially controversial, by 2006 it became commonly accepted that social media had an important role in public relations.&lt;ref name="Sheldrake2011"/&gt;

Press releases, which were mostly unchanged for more than a century, began to integrate digital features. [[BusinessWire]] introduced the "Smart News Release," which incorporated audio, video and images, in 1997. This was followed by the MultiVu multimedia release from [[PRNewswire]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="brian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Solis|title=Reviving the Traditional Press Release|url=http://www.briansolis.com/2009/05/reviving-traditional-press-release/|publisher=Brian Solis|date=May 18, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Social Media Release was created by Todd Defren from [[Shift Communications]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BeB PR: New uses for press releases|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1626924/b2b-pr-new-uses-for-press-releases|newspaper=Fast Company|first=Wendy|last=Marx|date=April 25, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a blog written by journalist and blogger Tom Foremski titled "Die!

According to ''The New York Times'', corporate communications shifted from a monologue to two-way conversational communications&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stuart|last=Elliott|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/business/media/redefining-public-relations-in-the-age-of-social-media.html?_r=0|accessdate=July 29, 2013|title=Redefining Public Relations in the Age of Social Media|date=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new media also made it "easier for consumers to learn about the mix-ups and blunders" of PR.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; For example, after the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]], [[British Petroleum|BP]] tried to deflect blame to other parties, claim the spill was not as significant as it was and focused on the science, while human interest stories related to the damage were emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/06/10/10greenwire-bps-pr-blunders-mirror-exxons-appear-destined-98819.html?pagewanted=3|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2013|first=Anne|last=Mulkern|title=BP's PR Blunders Mirror Exxon's, Appear Destined for Record Book }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Facebook tried to covertly spread privacy concerns about competitor Google's Social Circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook, Foe of Anonymity, is Forced to Explain a Secret|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 13, 2011|first=Miguel|last=Helft|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/14/technology/14facebook.html|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chapstick]] created a communications crisis after allegedly, repeatedly deleting negative comments on its Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ChapStick Gets Itself in a Social Media Death Spiral|date=October 26, 2011|first=Tim|last=Nudd|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/chapstick-gets-itself-social-media-death-spiral-136097|newspaper=AdWeek|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Iraq War]], it was exposed that the US created false radio personalities to spread pro-American information and paid Iraqi newspapers to write articles written by American troops.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"&gt;{{Citation|last=Schleifer|first=Ron|title=Reconstructing Iraq: Winning the Propaganda War in Iraq|newspaper=Middle East Quarterly|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShahAnup"&gt;{{citation|last=Shah|first=Anup|title=Iraq War Media Reporting, Journalism and Propaganda|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/461/media-reporting-journalism-and-propaganda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of imperfect competition include:

* [[Monopolistic competition]]: A situation in which many firms with slightly different products compete. Production costs are above what may be achieved by perfectly competitive firms, but society benefits from the product differentiation.
* [[Monopoly]]: A firm with no competitors in its industry. A monopoly firm produces less output, has higher costs, and sells its output for a higher price than it would if constrained by competition. These negative outcomes usually generate government regulation.
* [[Oligopoly]]: An industry with only a few firms. If they collude, they form a [[cartel]] to reduce output and drive up profits the way a monopoly does.
**[[Duopoly]]: A special form of Oligopoly, with only two firms in an industry.
* [[Monopsony]]: A market with a single buyer and many sellers.
* [[Oligopsony]]: A market with a few buyers and many sellers.

{{Companies law|other}}
{{Business administration}}

A '''business entity''' is an entity that is formed and administered as per [[corporate law]] in order to engage in [[business]] activities, charitable work, or other activities allowable. Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many types of [[business entities]] defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include [[corporation]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[partnership]]s, [[sole trader]]s, [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]] and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, for example:

:≈ [[Ltd.]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[public limited company]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[limited partnership]]
:≈ unlimited partnership
:≈ [[chartered company]]
:≈ [[Statutory corporation|statutory company]]
:≈ [[holding company]]
:≈ [[Subsidiary|subsidiary company]]
:≈ one man company ([[sole proprietorship]])
:≈ [[charitable incorporated organisation]] (UK)
:≈ [[non-governmental organization]]

However, the regulations governing particular types of entities, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choose a legal structure for a new business |url=https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures |publisher=[[GOV.UK]] |accessdate=19 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173536/https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures# |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada entities can be incorporated under either federal or provincial (or territorial) law. [[Unlimited liability corporation]]s can be formed in Alberta "AULC" and Nova Scotia "NSULC".

The word or expression "Limited", ''Limitée'', "Incorporated", ''Incorporée'', "Corporation" or ''Société par actions de régime fédéral'' or the corresponding abbreviation "Ltd.", ''Ltée'', "Inc.", "Corp." or ''S.A.R.F.'' forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK)

As an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated ''Société commerciale canadienne'' or by the abbreviation ''S.C.C.''

Under the [[Canada Cooperatives Act]] (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word "cooperative", "co-operative", "coop", "co-op", ''coopérative'', "united" or "pool", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name.

Unlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx|title=NS vs. Alberta ULCs|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723021544/http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx#|archive-date=2014-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures:
*SP (Sole Proprietorship): No formal business structure is established
*GP (General Partnership): Either a formal structure with a partnership agreement, or an informal structure, in which case the Partnerships Act for the province will apply
*LP (Limited Partnership): An investment structure, limiting both the liability and the participation of the investor. An investor who takes an active role will be deemed a general partner, and become exposed to unlimited liability.
*Corporation
*Joint Venture: A business activity shared by two or more business entities. The joint venture's activities must be finite in terms of either time or scope.

There are three main forms of business:

(a) Sole Proprietorship
(b) Partnership
(c) Company

*Sole Proprietorship

In a sole proprietorship, an individual on his/her own account carries out the business or profession. No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.

*Partnership

A partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.

Partnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.

For taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:

(i) Registered Firms
(ii) Unregistered Firms

The income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.

For unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).

*Company

A company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.

A company having share capital may be formed as:

(i) A company limited by shares.
(ii) A company limited by guarantee.
(iii) An unlimited company.

*Company Limited by Shares

The liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.

*Public Limited Companies can be formed by at least seven persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. The word 'Limited' is used as the last word of its name.
*Private Limited Companies may be formed by at least two persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. A private limited company, by its Articles of Association:

(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;
(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;
(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.

A private limited company is required to use the words "(Private) Limited" as the last words of its name.

*Company Limited By Guarantee

Means a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited" as the last words of their n
Unlimited Company

Means a company having unlimited liability of its members

==United States==
In the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.

=== Tax classifications ===
For federal tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has separate [[entity classification]] rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a [[corporation]], a [[partnership]], a [[Cooperative]] or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a [[C corporation]] or elect to be treated as a [[Subchapter S corporation]]. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member [[Limited liability company|LLC]]s; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified [[real estate investment trust]] subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity.&lt;ref name="Presti and Naegele Newsletter"&gt;[http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity Presti and Naegele Newsletter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173503/http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity# |date=2013-01-15 }}, 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To be recognized as a [[Cooperative]] for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="IRS Sub Chapter T"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184|title=IRS Sub Chapter T|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904163915/http://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184#d0e184|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federally incorporated===
The key word for a bank is "national". A bank chartered by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) must have the word "national" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have "national" in its name.

For a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is "federal", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word "federal" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have "federal" in its name.

*FSB ([[Federal savings bank|Federal Savings Bank]]), formerly called federal savings and loan association
*NA ([[National bank#United States|National Association]]), a designation used by banks chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
*NT&amp;SA ([[National Trust and Savings Association]]), a less common designation used by national banks
*[[Credit union#United States|Federal Credit Union]], chartered by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA)

Many federal governmental units are specially formed [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]]s, while some private organizations have received a [[Congressional charter|charter from Congress]].

===State, territory or commonwealth incorporated===
{{See also|United States corporate law}}

The following are the main business designations and types:
*'''[[Sole proprietorship]]''': a business consisting of a single owner (which may in turn be a business entity), not in a separately recognized business form.
*'''[[Trust (business)|Trust]]'''

====Partnerships====
*'''[[General partnership]]''': a partnership in which all the partners are jointly and separately liable for the debts of the partnership. In most U.S. states, it can be created by agreement without requiring a public filing. The partners may themselves be legal entities or individuals.
*[[Limited partnership|LP]], '''Limited partnership''': a partnership where at least one partner (the general partner, which may itself be an entity or an individual) has unlimited liability for the LP's debts and one or more partners (the limited partners) have limited liability (which means that they are not responsible for the LP's debts beyond the amount they agreed to invest). Limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the entity or its business. 
*[[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], '''Limited Liability Partnership''': a partnership where a partner's liability for the debts of the partnership is limited except in the case of liability for acts of professional negligence or malpractice. In some states, LLPs may only be formed for purposes of practicing a licensed profession, typically attorneys, accountants and architects. This is often the only form of limited partnership allowed for law firms (as opposed to general partnerships).
*[[Limited liability limited partnership|LLLP]], '''Limited Liability Limited Partnership''': a combination of LP and LLP, available in some states.

====Limited Liability Companies====
*[[Limited liability company|LLC]], LC, Ltd. Co., '''Limited Liability Company''': a form of business whose owners enjoy limited liability, but which is not a [[corporation]]. Allowable abbreviations vary by state. Note that in some states ''Ltd.'' by itself is not a valid abbreviation for an LLC, because in some states (e.g. [[Texas]]), it may denote a corporation instead. See also [[Series LLC]]. For U.S. federal tax purposes, in general, an LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership, and an LLC with one member is treated as a sole proprietorship.
*[[Limited liability company#Variations|PLLC]], '''Professional Limited Liability Company''': some states do not allow certain professionals to form an LLC that would limit the liability that results from the services professionals provide such as doctors, medical care; lawyers, legal advice; and accountants, accounting services; architects, architectural services; when the company formed offers the services of the professionals. Instead those states allow a PLLC or in the LLC statutes, the liability limitation only applies to the business side, such as creditors of the company, as opposed to the client/customer service side, the level of medical care, legal services, or accounting provided to clients. This is meant to maintain the higher ethical standards that these professionals have committed themselves to by becoming licensed in their profession and to prevent them from being immune (or at least limit their immunity) to malpractice suits.

====Corporations====
*[[Corporation|Corp.]], [[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]], '''Corporation, Incorporated''': used to denote [[corporation]]s ([[public company|public]] or otherwise). These are the only terms universally accepted by all 51 corporation chartering jurisdictions in the United States. However, in some states other suffixes may be used to identify a corporation, such as Ltd., Co./Company, or the Italian term S.p.A. (in [[Connecticut]]; see under [[#Italy|Italy]]). Some states that allow the use of "Company" prohibit the use of "and Company", "and Co.", "&amp; Company" or "&amp; Co.". In most states [[sole proprietorship]]s and partnerships may register a fictitious "[[doing business as]]" name with the word "Company" in it. For a full list of allowed designations by state, see the table below. 
*'''[[Professional corporation]]''', PC or P.C.: those corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, accountants, and doctors.
*'''[[Doing Business As]]''': denotes a business name used by a person or entity that is different from the person's or entity's true name. DBAs are not separate entities and do not shield the person or entity who uses the DBA as a business name from liability for debts or lawsuits. Filing requirements vary and are not permitted for some types of businesses or professional practices.  See also [[Delaware corporation]], [[Delaware statutory trust]], [[Nevada corporation]], and [[Massachusetts business trust]].

'''Managed services''' is the practice of [[outsourcing]] on a proactive basis certain processes and functions intended to  improve operations and cut expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=Introduction to Managed Services     |url= http://www.ca.com/us/~/media/Files/whitepapers/introduction-to-Managed-services-wp.pdf    |date=September 2012  |author=     |publisher=[[CA Technologies]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palachuk 208"&gt;{{cite book  | title= Managed Services in a Month  |url=http://www.managedservicesinamonth.com/index.html  | location = |last=Palachuk   |first =Karl | date =January 2013  | publisher =Great Little Book Publishing Co., Inc. |page=208  |isbn= 978-0981997858}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an alternative to the [[break/fix]] or [[on-demand outsourcing]] model where the service provider performs on-demand services and bills the customer only for the work done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=An Insight Into IT Service Delivery: Traditional Break-Fix vs A Managed Service   |url=http://www.oryxalign.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/An-insight-into-IT-Service-Delivery_Break-fix-vs-Managed-Services.pdf     |date=   |author=OryxAlign   |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=How Break/Fix Can Break Your Managed Services Business   |url=http://mspmentor.net/blog/how-breakfix-can-break-your-managed-services-business    |date=5 March 2010  |author= Nimsoft Guest   |publisher=MSPMentor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this subscription model, the client or customer is the entity that owns or has direct oversight of the organization or system being managed whereas the Managed Services Provider (MSP) is the [[service provider]] delivering the managed services.

==History and evolution==
The evolution of MSP started in the 1990s with the emergence of application service providers (ASPs) who helped pave the way for remote support for IT infrastructure. From the initial focus of remote monitoring and management of servers and networks, the scope of an MSP's services expanded to include mobile device management, managed security, remote firewall administration and  security-as-a-service,  and managed print services. Around 2005, [[Karl Palachuk|Karl W. Palachuk]], Amy Luby (Founder of Managed Service Provider Services Network acquired by High Street Technology Ventures), and Erick Simpson (Managed Services Provider University) were the first advocates and the pioneers of the managed services business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=MSPmentor 250 List 2014: Honorees N to P   |url=http://mspmentor.net/mspmentor-250/mspmentor-250-list-2014-honorees-n-p    |date=2015  |author=    |publisher=MSPMentor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=MSP Partners Recognizes Outstanding Contributions in Managed Services    |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080807005757/en/MSP-Partners-Recognizes-Outstanding-Contributions-Managed-Services     |date=7 August 2008  |author=    |publisher=BusinessWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first books on the topic of managed services: ''Service Agreements for SMB Consultants: A Quick-Start Guide to Managed Services''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | title= Service Agreements for SMB Consultants  |url=  | location = |last=Palachuk   |first =Karl | date =  | publisher =Great Little Book Publishing Co., Inc. |page= |isbn= 978-0976376026}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Guide to a Successful Managed Services Practice''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=The Guide to a Successful Managed Services Practice|last=Simpson|first=Erick|date=15 August 2006|publisher=Intelligent Enterprise|isbn=978-0978894306|location=|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; were published in 2006 by Palachuk and Simpson, respectively. Since then, the managed services [[business model]] has gained ground among enterprise level companies. As the [[value-added reseller]] (VAR) community evolved to higher level of services, it adapted the managed service model and tailored it to SMB companies.

In the new economy, IT manufacturers are currently moving away from a "box-shifting" resale to a more customized, managed service offering. In this transition, the billing and sales processes of [[intangible asset|intangible]] managed services, appear as the main challenges for traditional resellers.

The managed services market is expected to grow from an estimated $152.45 billion in 2017 to $257.84 billion by 2022, representing a [[Compound annual growth rate|CAGR]] of 11.1%. With IT driving all business operations, the significance of aligning managed IT services with all levels in an organization has grown to ensure reliability and continuity of business goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jonathan|first1=Stokes|title=Managed IT Services Can Spur the Growth of Your Business|url=https://medium.com/@stokesjonathan38/managed-it-services-can-spur-the-growth-of-your-business-6be486544c0f|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common managed services==
In the information technology area, the most common managed services appear to evolve around connectivity and bandwidth, network monitoring, security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=How to use managed services to overcome the top 6 app security hurdles    |url=http://www.information-age.com/technology/security/123461048/how-use-managed-services-overcome-top-6-app-security-hurdles     |date= 7 March 2016     |author=Chloe Green  |publisher=Information Age  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[virtualization]], and disaster recovery.&lt;ref name="top5"/&gt; Beyond traditional application and infrastructure management, managed services may also include storage, desktop and communications, mobility, help desk and technical support.  In general, common managed services include the following applications.

== Managed services provider ==

===Definition===
A managed services provider (MSP) is most often an [[information technology]] (IT) services provider that manages and assumes responsibility for providing a defined set of services to its clients either proactively or as the MSP (not the client) determines that services are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Managed service provider (MSP) |url= http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/managed-service-provider     |date=2015  |author=Margaret Rouse |publisher=[[TechTarget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=Top ten criteria for selecting a managed services provider     |url= http://www.ibm.com/midmarket/it/it/att/pdf/Top_ten_criteria.pdf |date=2015 |author= |publisher=IBM Global Technology Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most MSPs bill an upfront setup or transition fee and an ongoing flat or near-fixed monthly fee, which benefits clients by providing them with predictable IT support costs. Sometimes, MSPs act as facilitators who manage and procure staffing services on behalf of the client. In such context, they use an online application called [[vendor management system]] (VMS) for transparency and efficiency.

The managed services model has been useful in the private sector, notably among [[Fortune 500 |Fortune 500 companies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=60% of Fortune 500 Companies Running ManageEngine |url=http://mspmentor.net/managed-services/60-fortune-500-companies-running-manageengine |date=23 April 2012  |author=Joe Panettieri |publisher=MSPMentor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an interesting future in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=IT Managed Services in the Public Sector |url=http://www.storagecraft.com/blog/it-managed-services-in-the-public-sector/ |date=4 June 2015 |author=Casey Morgan     |publisher=storagecraft }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''market analysis''' studies the attractiveness and the dynamics of a special [[Market (economics)|market]] within a special industry. It is part of the industry analysis and thus in turn of the [[global environmental analysis]]. Through all of these analyses, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a company can be identified. Finally, with the help of a [[SWOT analysis]], adequate business strategies of a company will be defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillerup, R.,|first=Stoi, R.|title=Unternehmensführung|year=2006|publisher=Vahlen|location=München}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The market analysis is also known as a documented investigation of a market that is used to inform a firm's planning activities, particularly around decisions of [[inventory]], purchase, [[work force]] expansion/contraction, facility expansion, purchases of capital equipment, promotional activities, and many other aspects of a company.

==Market segmentation==
[[Market segmentation]] is the basis for a differentiated market analysis. [[Differentiation (economics)|Differentiation]] is important. One main reason is the saturation of consumption, which exists due to the increasing competition in offered products. Consumers ask for more individual products and services and are better informed about the range of products than before. As a consequence, market segmentation is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger, F.,|first=Fuchs, W.|title=Management der Marketing-Kommunikation|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segmentation includes a lot of market research, since a lot of market knowledge is required to segment the market. Market research about market structures and processes must be done to define the “relevant market”.  The relevant market is an integral part of the whole market, on which the company focuses its activities. To identify and classify the relevant market, a market classification or segmentation has to be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruhn, M.|title=Marketing – Grundlagen für Studium und Praxis|year=2009|publisher=Gabler|location=Wiesbaden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market segmentation is an important way to find competitive advantage with its differentiation in market analysis. Market segmentation concentrates on market energy and power to gain competitive advantage. In other words, market segmentation is the concept tool to get the force (Thomas, 2007). In market analysis, market knowledge is required to analyze market structure and process. Since segmentation requires a lot of market research, various information can be extracted from it. Market segmentation can identify customer needs and wants and develop products to their satisfaction. Market segmentation can identify different products for different groups, better match customer wants and product benefits, maximize the use of available resources and focus marketing expenditures and competitive advantages (Karlsson,2012).

There is no specific way to segment market. However, businesses can follow generalized rules like geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral. A good market segmentation should be sustainable, accessible, actionable, measurable, and differentiable (Karlsson,2012).

==Dimensions of market analysis==
[[David A. Aaker]] outlined the following dimensions of a market analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Analysis|url=http://www.netmba.com/marketing/market/analysis/|publisher=NeMBA|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Market size (current and future)
* Market trends
* Market growth rate
* Market profitability
* Industry cost structure
* Distribution channels
* Key success factors
* Key success details

Market analysis strives to determine the attractiveness of a market, currently and in the future.  Organizations evaluate future attractiveness of a market by understanding evolving opportunities, and threats as they relate to that organization's own strengths and weaknesses.

Organizations use these findings to guide the investment decisions they make to advance their success. The findings of a market analysis may motivate an organization to change various aspects of its investment strategy. Affected areas may include [[inventory]] levels, a [[work force]] expansion/contraction, facility expansion, purchases of capital equipment, and promotional activities.

==Elements==

===Market size===
The [[market size]] is defined through the market volume and the market potential. The market volume exhibits the totality of all realized sales volume of a special market. The volume is therefore dependent on the quantity of consumers and their ordinary [[demand]]. Furthermore, the market volume is either measured in quantities or qualities. The quantities can be given in technical terms, like GW for power capacities, or in numbers of items. Qualitative measuring mostly uses the sales turnover as an indicator. That means that the market price and the quantity are taken into account. Besides the market volume, the market potential is of equal importance. It defines the upper limit of the total demand and takes potential clients into consideration. Although the market potential is rather fictitious, it offers good values of orientation. The relation of market volume to market potential provides information about the chances of market growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillerup, R.|first=Stoi, R.|title=Unternehmensführung|year=2006|publisher=Vahlen|location=München}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aaker, D. A.|first=McLoughlin, D.|title=Strategic Market Management – Global Perspectives|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.|location=West Sussex}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following are examples of information sources for determining market size:

* Government data
* [[Trade association]] data
* Financial data from major players
* Customer surveys

===Market trends===
[[Market trend]]s are the upward or downward movement of a market, during a period of time. The market size is more difficult to estimate if one is starting with something completely new. In this case, you will have to derive the figures from the number of potential customers, or customer segments.

Besides information about the target market, one also needs information about one's competitors, customers, products, etc. Lastly, you need to measure marketing effectiveness. A few techniques are:

*[[Customer analysis]]
*[[Choice modelling]]
*Competitor analysis
*[[Risk analysis]]
*[[Product research]]
*Advertising the research
*[[Marketing mix]] modeling
*Simulated Test Marketing[5]

Changes in the market are important because they often are the source of new opportunities and threats. Moreover, they have the potential to dramatically affect the market size.

Examples include changes in economic, social, regulatory, legal, and political conditions and in available technology, price sensitivity, demand for variety, and level of emphasis on service and support.

===Market growth rate===
A simple means of forecasting the [[market growth]] rate is to [[extrapolate]] historical data into the future. While this method may provide a first-order estimate, it does not predict important [[turning point]]s. A better method is to study [[market trends]] and sales growth in complementary products. Such drivers serve as leading indicators that are more accurate than simply extrapolating historical data.

Important inflection points in the market growth rate sometimes can be predicted by constructing a [[Diffusion of innovations|product diffusion curve]]. The shape of the curve can be estimated by studying the characteristics of the adoption rate of a similar product in the past.

Ultimately, many markets mature and decline.  Some leading indicators of a market's decline include market saturation, the emergence of substitute products, and/or the absence of growth drivers.

===Market opportunity===
{{see also|business opportunity}}
A market opportunity [[Product (business)|product]] or a service, based on either one [[technology]] or several, fulfills the [[demand|need(s)]] of a (preferably increasing) [[Market (economics)|market]] better than the competition and better than substitution-technologies within the given environmental frame (e.g. society, politics, legislation, etc.).

===Market profitability===
While different organizations in a market will have different levels of [[profitability]], they are all similar to different market conditions. [[Michael Porter]] devised a useful framework for evaluating the attractiveness of an industry or market. This framework, known as [[Porter five forces analysis]], identifies five factors that influence the market profitability:

* [[Buying power|Buyer power]]
* Supplier power
* Barriers to [[market entry|entry]]
* Threat of [[substitute product]]s
* [[Competition (economics)|Rivalry]] among firms in the industry{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Industry cost structure===
The [[cost structure]]&lt;ref name="Whatiscoststructure"&gt;{{cite web |  title=What is cost structure? - Questions &amp; Answers | website=AccountingTools | date=2013-04-09 | url=http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/what-is-cost-structure.html | accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is important for identifying key factors for success. To this end, Porter's [[value chain]] model is useful for determining where value is added and for isolating the costs.

The cost structure also is helpful for formulating strategies to develop a competitive advantage. For example, in some environments the [[experience curve effect]] can be used to develop a cost advantage over competitors.

===Distribution channels===
Examining the following aspects of the distribution system may help with a market
analysis:

* Existing [[distribution channel]]s - can be described by how direct they are to the customer.
* Trends and emerging channels - new channels can offer the opportunity to develop a competitive advantage.
* Channel power structure - for example, in the case of a product having little brand equity, retailers have negotiating power over manufacturers and can capture more margin.

===Success factors===
The key success factors are those elements that are necessary in order for the firm to achieve its marketing objectives. A few examples of such factors include:

* Access to essential unique resources
* Ability to achieve [[economies of scale]]
* Access to distribution channels
* Technological progress

It is important to consider that key success factors may change over time, especially as the product progresses through its life cycle.

'''Environmental analysis'''

The environmental analysis can be divided into two parts which are external and internal factors. External factors. Political issues, social potential force, and local economy called external environmental factors. Internal environmental factors belongs to company's internal position such as employees, department structure, budget and so forth (Christina, n.d.). How environmental effect markets. According to the Parry, the government limit pollution emission, they mention environmental taxes to prevent company which produce pollution substance. In other words, the government drives the organization. On the contrary, the cost of products increase due to the environmental taxes. It means that company may take measure of reducing production which may grow unemployment rate by emission tax. Therefore, the environmental taxes leads a income equality. It is not an excuse ignore our serious environmental problem. Even though the higher income group also can benefit from windfall gains(Parry, 2002).

'''Competitive analysis'''

According to the Christina, competitive analysis is that company must know their competitors which have the same common services and products. The business can use like product cost, operational efficiency, brand recognition and market Dimensions of market analysis

Except for David A. Aaker's 7 main dimension of a market analysis including market size, market growth rate, market profitability, industry cost structure, distribution channel, market trends, and key success factor, there is another analysis of dimension market analysis. Based on Christina Callaway, dimension of market analysis can be divided into four parts which is environmental analysis, competitive analysis, target audience analysis, and SWOT analysis. The market analysis is to help company to illustrate current trend in the market and may affect the profitability ( Christina, n.d.). At the same time, market analysis is also to determine the attractiveness in the market. A good marketing analysis can improve organization investment decision accurately, they can based on the attractiveness to change investment tactical.

The market analysis is to help company to illustrate current trend in the market and may affect the profitability for the business(Thomas,2007). It can be seen as a part of industry analysis with using global environmental analysis. Company can identify strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats so that the business can define the business strategy. The market analysis is also reference for company's activity , like decisions of inventory, purchase, work force, facility expansion and many aspects of company.

penetration to find the difference or competitive advantages between two similarly companies(Christina, n.d). How can we find the competitive advantage? Kevin (2016) says that "Anticipating and reading market needs can help business leaders take significant steps towards changing the game and obtaining competitive advantage."(p.&amp;nbsp;70). How can we sustain competitive advantages? In terms of Richard research,  The company should focus on sustaining competitive advantage due to the swift growth global competition. Therefore, Business practice management is the follow principle to maintain competitive advantage(Richard,2006).

'''Target audience analysis'''

In the Christina contribution, target audience is for company to target their customer group who  most likely to buy their products(Christina, n.d.). The group can be classified with location, age, gender, income, ethnicity, and behaviors. And people who make a decision of purchase can also be divided in the target audience. How identify market in accordance with Women's enterprise centre the market can be classified in three types which are consumer market, industrial market, and reseller market. The company segment their market, research market, and identify why customer would like to buy their products (women's enterprise centre, 2011 ).

'''SWOT analysis'''

SWOT is strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats. It matches internal strengths and weaknesses up against opportunities and threats (Christina, n.d.). Strengths and weakness are internal factors which we can control. And opportunities and threats are external factors that businesses can't control, but can however impact on. When using strengths and weakness, businesses need to collect raw data to get information. Businesses can get information by customer feedback, employee surveys. Furthermore, businesses also can identify the capability if it is weakness or strengths, resources and process. Opportunities and threats are the external factors. Business can get information from secondary data like environmental information, industry information and competitive data. The purpose of the business use the SWOT analysis is to get the information from it and match each other to develop the ideas and get into goal statement to form strategic development (Olsen, 2008).

Market communication has significant impact on building and maintaining the relationship of stakeholders. Market analysis elements is to form a strategic planning and the information is responsiveness, intelligence generation, and dissemination(Mike, Sandra&amp; Felix, 2005). Besides, market communication provide the information focus on the customer needs and competitive advantage. At the same time, these information spread to customers means the company spread its brand value so that customer can make awareness of the company's products. It is the communication channel between business and customers(Mike, Sandra&amp; Felix, 2005).

'''Market Segmentation'''

Market segmentation is one of the important ways to find competitive advantage with its differentiation in market analysis. Market segmentation concentrates on market energy and power to gain competitive advantage. In other words, market segmentation is the concept tool to get the force(Thomas,2007). In the market analysis, we need a lot of market knowledge to analyse market structure and process. Since segmentation needs to do a lot of market research so that we can get the information from it. Market segmentation recommends the market strategy. Market segmentation can identify customer needs and wants and develop products to satisfy them. Market segmentation can identify different products for different groups, better match between customer wants and product benefits, maximize the use of available resources, focuse marketing expenditures and competitive advantages (karlsson,2012).

There is no perfect way to segment market but business can follow some rules like geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral. A good market segmentation should be sustainable, accessible, actionable, measurable, and differentiable (karlsson,2012).

'''Global market segmentation'''

Since the globalization more and more developed, the global market become indispensability part of the business thinking. In order to explore global market, how market segmentation can be used in the global market. There are some aspects of defining the global market so which is more efficient to segment global market. Some researchers mention about Cross-National and Cross-Cultural Approach to segment global market. To differentiate country and culture, the company have to identify two areas which is vertical market segment existing internal area. Another area is external market segments which a group of countries has relationship of each other and share their characteristics. Compared with cross- cultural approach and cross-national approach, cross-cultural approach has its cultural stability of traditional values. cultural stability has a wide range of shared national-cultural values features, due to group solidarity, interpersonal harmony and so forth(Agarwal, Malhotra &amp; Bolto, 2010). However, cross-cultural approach has challenge of environmental changes, cultural change and some other unstable factors(Agarwal, Malhotra &amp; Bolto, 2010). Therefore, the main principle of looking at cross-cultural approach and cross- national approach base on perceive service quality. In the global service marketing, the marketing manager face a challenge of international services on account of the intangibility of services, unification standardizing services across national borders and difference of preference for customized services in different countries and culture. Therefore, it is significance for business to have a deep understanding service quality in facing across different countries, regions and cultures( Agarwal, Malhotra &amp; Bolto, 2010).

In the software market, the trend of software is the price is high and coverage is low. In order to improve the trend, there is some problems of software market. Zhang (2014) mention that“  (1) What possibly discourages product differentiation in such a competitive market? (2) Why is versioning absent here? (3) How does the presence of free alternatives in this market impact its structure?”(p.&amp;nbsp;589). In order to improve these problems, Zhang mention that quality competition and market segmentation apply to the software market. In Zhang's research, the software company lack of developed the method of quality competition, market segmentation, and versioning. In terms of market segmentation, software company think segmentation consumer market is not useful. Therefore, even though versioning is the least costless way of spread product information, the company still ignore it(Zhang, 2014).

The relationship between market segmentation and communication in marketing is interaction. For example, market segmentation is important in the social media. There is three perspectives supplier perspectives, interaction perspectives, and buyer perspectives. In order to balance these three relationships, business must do segment well. Otherwise, the buyer perspective and supplier perspective cannot interact very well may lead loss of promotion (Oxfordlearninglab, 2009). Therefore, social media is important method of communication in the market and market segmentation also unnecessary before the business use social media channel.

===Applications===
The literature defines several areas in which market analysis is important. These include: sales forecasting, [[market research]], and marketing strategy.  Not all [[managers]] will need to conduct a market analysis.  Nevertheless, it would be important for managers that use market analysis data to know how analysts derive their conclusions and what techniques they use to do so.

'''Market intelligence''' is the information relevant to a company’s markets, gathered and analyzed specifically for the purpose of accurate and confident [[decision-making]] in determining strategy in areas such as [[market opportunity]], [[market penetration]] strategy, and [[market development]].&lt;ref name="Cornish"&gt;Cornish, S. L. “Product Innovation and the Spatial Dynamics of Market Intelligence: Does Proximity to Markets Matter?” Economic Geography. Volume: 73, Issue 2 (April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Market intelligence includes the process of gathering data from the company’s external environment, whereas the [[Business intelligence]] process primarily is based on internal recorded events – such as sales, shipments and purchases. The purpose of incorporating Market Information or intelligence into the Business Intelligence process is to provide decision makers with a more “complete picture” of ongoing corporate performance in a set of given market conditions.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;Prescott, John and others, Proven Strategies in Competitive Intelligence (Wiley, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gathering market intelligence data ==
Effective market intelligence needs accurate market information that is gathered with right tools and methods. To gather information companies can conduct [[survey (human research)|survey]]s, [[interview]]s, visit and monitor competitors outlets or gather and buy data from different sources.

Traditional interviews and surveys can be done either in-house or by using specialists agencies. As more and more markets are digitalized the market intelligence space has seen a lot of new digital tools that companies can use. There are tools such as [https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/home Google Consumer Survey] that enables companies to ask web users a question through Google network of online publishers. There are also specialist sites companies can buy market intelligence information and market intelligence software that companies can use to collect and monitor data from the internet.

An '''operational system''' is a term used in [[data warehousing]] to refer to a system that is used to process the day-to-day transactions of an organization. These systems are designed in a manner that processing of day-to-day transactions is performed efficiently and the integrity of the transactional data is preserved.
== Synonyms ==
Sometimes operational systems are referred to as [[operational database]]s, [[transaction processing system]]s, or [[online transaction processing]] systems (OLTP). However, the use of the last two terms as synonyms may be confusing, because operational systems can be [[batch processing]] systems as well.

Any enterprise must necessarily maintain a lot of data about its operation.

{{marketing}}
The '''point of sale''' ('''POS''') or '''point of purchase''' ('''POP''') is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed.  At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an [[invoice]] for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and indicates the options for the customer to make payment.  It is also the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service.  After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a [[receipt]] for the transaction, which is usually printed but is increasingly being dispensed with or sent electronically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paperless Receipt Solution (PRS) System|url=http://www.jamesdysonaward.org/projects/paperless-receipt-solution-prs-system/
 |publisher=James Dyson Foundation|accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Transmission of Prescriptions|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/prescribing-and-dispensing/electronic-prescription-service-eps
 |publisher=Business Services Authority|accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tricks traders use to evade billions of francs in taxes|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2014-10-10/181782/|publisher=The New Times|accessdate=August 9, 2015|author=Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To calculate the amount owed by a customer, the merchant may use various devices such as [[weighing scale]]s, [[barcode]] scanners, and [[cash register]]s.  To make a payment, [[payment terminal]]s, touch screens, and other hardware and software options are available.

The point of sale is often referred to as the point of service because it is not just a point of sale but also a point of return or customer order.   POS terminal software may also include features for additional functionality, such as [[inventory management]], [[Customer relationship management|CRM]], financials, or [[warehouse|warehousing]].

Businesses are increasingly adopting POS systems, and one of the most obvious and compelling reasons is that a POS system does away with the need for [[price tag]]s.  Selling prices are linked to the [[Universal Product Code|product code]] of an item when adding stock, so the cashier merely needs to scan this code to process a sale.  If there is a price change, this can also be easily done through the inventory window. Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control.

==Terminology==
Retailers and marketers will often refer to the area around the checkout instead as the '''point of purchase''' ('''POP''') when they are discussing it from the retailer's perspective. This is particularly the case when planning and designing the area as well as when considering a marketing strategy and offers.

Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.

Nevertheless, it is the term ''POS system'' rather than ''retail management system'' that is in vogue among both end-users and vendors.

The basic, fundamental definition of a POS System, is a system which allows the processing and recording of transactions between a company and their consumers, at the time in which goods and/or services are purchased.

==History==

===Software before the 1990s===
[[File:McDonalds keyboard 6.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[McDonald's]] POS device by Brobeck]]

Early electronic [[cash register]]s (ECR) were controlled with proprietary software and were limited in function and communication capability. In August 1973, IBM released the IBM 3650 and 3660 store systems that were, in essence, a mainframe computer used as a store controller that could control up to 128 IBM 3653/3663 point of sale registers. This system was the first commercial use of client-server technology, [[peer-to-peer]] communications, [[local area network]] (LAN) simultaneous backup, and remote initialization. By mid-1974, it was installed in [[Pathmark]] stores in New Jersey and [[Dillard's]] department stores.

One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for [[McDonald's|McDonald's Restaurants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, [2] Vanilla Shake, [1] Large Fries, [3] BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item. By pressing the [Grill] button, a second or third order could be worked on while the first transaction was in progress. When the customer was ready to pay, the [Total] button would calculate the bill, including sales tax for almost any jurisdiction in the United States. This made it accurate for McDonald's and very convenient for the servers and provided the restaurant owner with a check on the amount that should be in the cash drawers. Up to eight devices were connected to one of two interconnected computers so that printed reports, prices, and taxes could be handled from any desired device by putting it into ''Manager Mode''. In addition to the error-correcting memory, accuracy was enhanced by having three copies of all important data with many numbers stored only as multiples of 3. Should one computer fail, the other could handle the entire store.

In 1986, Gene Mosher introduced the first graphical point of sale software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Comdex_1986.png#globalusage  |title = Graphical point of sale software introducer}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a [[touchscreen]] interface under the ViewTouch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viewtouch.com/|title=ViewTouch|publisher=ViewTouch|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; trademark on the 16-bit [[Atari 520ST]] color computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gigi Bisson |url=http://www.viewtouch.com/AtariStart.html |title=Getting Down To Business |publisher=Viewtouch.com |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a color [[touchscreen]] widget-driven interface that allowed configuration of widgets representing menu items without low level programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv2n6/gettingdowntobusiness.html The ViewTouch restaurant system] by Giselle Bisson&lt;/ref&gt; The ViewTouch point of sale software was first demonstrated in public at Fall Comdex, 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Comdex_1986.png |title=File:Comdex 1986.png&amp;nbsp;— Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Las Vegas Nevada to large crowds visiting the Atari Computer booth. This was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface and was installed in several restaurants in the USA and Canada.

In 1986, [[IBM]] introduced its [[IBM 4680|468x]] series of POS equipment based on [[Digital Research]]'s [[Concurrent DOS 286]] and [[FlexOS]] 1.xx, a modular real-time multi-tasking multi-user operating system.

===Modern software (post-1990s)===

A wide range of POS applications have been developed on platforms such as Windows and Unix. The availability of local processing power, local data storage, networking, and graphical user interface made it possible to develop flexible and highly functional POS systems. Cost of such systems has also declined, as all the components can now be purchased off-the-shelf.

In 1993, IBM adopted [[FlexOS 2.32]] as the basis of their [[IBM 4690 OS]] in their 469x series of POS terminals. This was developed up to 2014 when it was sold to [[Toshiba]], who continued to support it up to at least 2017.

As far as computers are concerned, off-the-shelf versions are usually newer and hence more powerful than proprietary POS terminals. Custom modifications are added as needed. Other products, like touchscreen tablets and laptops, are readily available in the market, and they are more portable than traditional POS terminals.  The only advantage of the latter is that they are typically built to withstand rough handling and spillages; a benefit for food &amp; beverage businesses.

The key requirements that must be met by modern POS systems include high and consistent operating speed, reliability, ease of use, remote supportability, low cost, and rich functionality. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane.

Reliability depends not wholly on the developer but at times on the compatibility between a database and an OS version.  For example, the widely used [[Microsoft Access|MS Access]] database system had a compatibility issue when Windows XP machines were updated to a newer Windows OS. Microsoft immediately offered no solution. Some businesses were severely disrupted in the process, and many downgraded back to Windows XP for a quick resolution. Other companies utilized community support, for a registry tweak solution has been found for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/88542372-0fcb-4521-87ec-e2ab72e688dd/access-2007-very-slow-on-windows-7?forum=officesetupdeploylegacy|title=Access 2007 very slow on Windows 7|website=social.technet.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

POS systems are one of the most complex software systems available because of the features that are required by different end-users. Many POS systems are software suites that include sale, inventory, stock counting, vendor ordering, customer loyalty and reporting modules.  Sometimes purchase ordering, stock transferring, quotation issuing, barcode creating, bookkeeping or even accounting capabilities are included.  Furthermore, each of these modules is interlinked if they are to serve their practical purpose and maximize their usability.

For instance, the sale window is immediately updated on a new member entry through the membership window because of this interlinking.  Similarly, when a sale transaction is made, any purchase by a member is on record for the membership window to report providing information like payment type, goods purchased, date of purchase and points accumulated. Comprehensive analysis performed by a POS machine may need to process several qualities about a single product, like selling price, balance, average cost, quantity sold, description and department.  Highly complex programming is involved (and possibly considerable computer resources) to generate such extensive analyses.

POS systems are designed not only to serve the retail, wholesale and hospitality industries as historically is the case.  Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.

Different customers have different expectations within each trade. The reporting functionality alone is subject to so many demands, especially from those in the retail/wholesale industry.  To cite special requirements, some business's goods may include perishables and hence the inventory system must be capable of prompting the admin and cashier on expiring or expired products.  Some retail businesses require the system to store credit for their customers, credit which can be used subsequently to pay for goods. A few companies even expect the POS system to behave like a full-fledged [[inventory management]] system, including the ability to provide even FIFO (First In First Out) and LIFO (Last In First Out), reports of their goods for [[accounting]] and tax purposes.

In the hospitality industry, POS system capabilities can also diverge significantly.  For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.

It may be said that a POS system can be made to serve different things to different end-users depending on their unique business processes. Quite often an off-the-shelf POS system is inadequate for customers; some customization is required, and this is why a POS system can become very complex. The complexity of a mature POS system even extends to remote networking or interlinking between remote outlets and the HQ such that updating both ways is possible. Some POS systems even offer the linking of web-based orders to their sale window.  Even when local networking is only required (as in the case of a high-traffic supermarket), there is the ever-present challenge for the developer to keep most if not all of their POS stations running. This puts high demand not just on software coding but also designing the whole system covering how individual stations and the network work together, and special consideration for the performance capability and usage of databases. Due to such complexity, bugs and errors encountered in POS systems are frequent.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

With regards to databases, POS systems are very demanding on their performance because of numerous submissions and retrievals of data - required for correct sequencing the receipt number, checking up on various discounts, membership, calculating subtotal, so forth - just to process a single sale transaction.  The immediacy required of the system on the sale window such as may be observed at a checkout counter in a supermarket also cannot be compromised. This places much stress on individual enterprise databases if there are just several tens of thousands of sale records in the database. Enterprise database Ms SQL, for example, has been known to freeze up (including the OS) entirely for many minutes under such conditions showing a "Timeout Expired" error message.   Even a lighter database like Ms Access will slow to a crawl over time if the problem of database bloating is not foreseen and managed by the system automatically. Therefore, the need to do extensive testing, [[debugging]] and improvisation of solutions to preempt failure of a database before commercialization further complicates the development.

POS system accuracy is demanding, given that monetary transactions are involved continuously not only via the sale window but also at the backend through the receiving and inputting of goods into the inventory. Calculations required are not always straightforward.  There may be many discounts and deals that are unique to specific products, and the POS machine must quickly process the differences and the effect on pricing. There is much complexity in the programming of such operations, especially when no error in calculation can be allowed.

Other requirements include that the system must have functionality for membership discount and points accumulation/usage, quantity and promotional discounts, mix and match offers, cash rounding up, invoice/delivery-order issuance with outstanding amount.  It should enable a user to adjust the inventory of each product based on physical count, track expiry of perishable goods, change pricing, provide audit trail when modification of inventory records is performed, be capable of multiple outlet functionality, control of stocks from HQ, doubling as an invoicing system, just to name some.

It is clear that POS system is a term that implies a wide range of capabilities depending on the end-user requirements. POS system review websites cannot be expected to cover most let alone all the features; in fact, unless one is a developer himself, it is unrealistic to expect the reviewer to know all the nuts and bolts of a POS system.  For instance, a POS system might work smoothly on a test database during the review but not when the database grows significantly in size over months of usage. And this is only one among many hidden critical functionality issues of a POS system.

===Hardware interface standardization (post-1980s)===
Vendors and retailers are working to standardize development of computerized POS systems and simplify interconnecting POS devices. Two such initiatives are [[OPOS]] and [[JavaPOS]], both of which conform to the [[UnifiedPOS]] standard led by [[National Retail Foundation|The National Retail Foundation]].

'''OPOS''' ([[Object linking and embedding|OLE]] for POS) was the first commonly adopted standard and was created by [[Microsoft]], [[NCR Corporation]], [[Epson]] and [[Fujitsu|Fujitsu-ICL]]. OPOS is a [[Component object model|COM]]-based interface compatible with all COM-enabled [[programming language]]s for [[Microsoft Windows]]. OPOS was first released in 1996. '''JavaPOS''' was developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], [[IBM]], and [[NCR Corporation]] in 1997 and first released in 1999. JavaPOS is for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] what OPOS is for Windows, and thus largely platform independent.

There are several communication ways POS systems use to control peripherals such as:
* Logic Controls \ BemaTech
* Epson Esc/POS
* UTC Standard
* UTC Enhanced
* AEDEX
* ICD 2002
* Ultimate
* CD 5220
* DSP-800
* ADM 787/788
* HP

There are also nearly as many proprietary protocols as there are companies making POS peripherals. Most POS peripherals, such as displays and printers, support several of these command protocols in order to work with many different brands of POS terminals and computers.

==User interface design==

The design of the sale window is the most important one for the user. This [[user interface]] is highly critical when compared to those in other software packages such as word editors or spreadsheet programs where the speed of navigation is not so crucial for business performance.

For businesses at prime locations where real estate comes at a premium, it can be common to see a queue of customers. The faster a sale is completed the shorter the queue and hence the more room available in a store for customers to shop around and employees to do their work.  High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.

Although improving the [[ergonomics]] is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.

==Cloud-based (post-2000s)==
The advent of [[cloud computing]] has given birth to the possibility of POS systems to be deployed as [[software as a service]], which can be accessed directly from the [[Internet]] using any [[internet browser]]. Using the previous advances in the communication protocols for POS's control of hardware, cloud-based POS systems are independent from platform and operating system limitations. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's [[IPad]]. Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to [[mobile device]]s, such as [[tablet computer]]s or [[smartphone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scandit.com/mobile-point-of-sale-apps-redefining-the-industry/ | title=Mobile Point-of-Sale Apps: Redefining the Retail Industry | publisher=Scandit | date=10 May 2013 | accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices can also act as [[Barcode reader#Smartphones|barcode reader]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s using a built-in camera and as [[payment terminal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s using built-in [[Near field communication|NFC]] technology or an external payment card reader. A number of POS companies built their software specifically to be cloud-based. Other businesses who launched pre-2000s have since adapted their software to evolving technology.



Cloud-based POS systems are different from traditional POS largely because user data, including sales and inventory, are not stored locally, but in a remote server. The POS system is also not run locally, so there is no installation required.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.primaseller.com/blog/cloud-traditional-point-of-sale/ Cloud vs Traditional Point of Sale] via Primaseller&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bonfire"&gt;[http://smallbusinessbonfire.com/online-pos-system-revolution The Online POS System Revolution] via Small Business Bonfire&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.

Other advantages of a cloud-based POS are instant centralization of data (important especially to chain stores), ability to access data from anywhere there is internet connection, and lower start-up costs.&lt;ref name="bonfire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bluebird-global.com/epos-systems/cloud-based-point-sale-works/ | title=How Cloud-Based POS Works | publisher=Bluebird | accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud based POS requires an internet connection. For this reason it important to use a device which has its own 3G capability in case the device's primary internet goes down. In addition to being significantly less expensive than traditional legacy point of sale systems, the real strength of a cloud based point of sale system is that there are developers all over the world creating software applications for cloud based POS.  Cloud based POS systems are often described{{By whom|date=April 2017}} as future proof as new applications are constantly being conceived and built.

A number of noted emerging cloud-based POS systems came on the scene less than a decade or even half a decade back. These systems are usually designed for restaurants, small and medium-sized retail operations with fairly simple sale processes as can be culled from POS system review sites.  It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. "Enterprise-level" here means that the inventory should be capable of handling a large number of records, such as required by grocery stores and supermarkets. It can also mean that the system--software and cloud server--must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation.

POS vendors of such cloud based systems should also have a strong contingency plan for the breakdown of their remote server such as represented by failover server support.  However, sometimes even a major data center can fail completely, such as in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/power-cooling/overheating-brings-down-microsoft-data-center/74543.fullarticle|title=Overheating brings down Microsoft data center|website=DatacenterDynamics|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On-premises installations are therefore sometimes seen alongside cloud-based implementation to preempt such incidents, especially for businesses with very high traffic. However the on-premises installations may not have the most up-to-date inventory and membership information.

For such contingency, a more innovative though highly complex approach for the developer is to have a trimmed down version of the POS system installed on the cashier computer at the outlet.  On a daily basis the latest inventory and membership information from the remote server is automatically updated into the local database.  Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales.  When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database.

Although cloud-based POS systems save the end-user startup cost and technical challenges in maintaining an otherwise on-premises installation, there is a risk that should the cloud-based vendor close down it may result in more immediate termination of services for the end-user compared to the case of a traditional full on-premises POS system where it can still run without the vendor.

Another consideration is that a cloud-based POS system actually exposes business data to service providers - the hosting service company and the POS vendor which have access to both the application and database.  The importance of securing critical business information such as supplier names, top selling items, customer relationship processes cannot be underestimated given that sometimes the few key success factors or trade secrets of a business are actually accessible through the POS system. This security and privacy concern is an ongoing issue in [[cloud computing]].

==Retail industry==
{{Main article|Retail}}
The retail industry is one of the predominant users of POS terminals.
[[File:Cashier stand in a Nigerian Grocery store.jpg|thumb|Points of sale at a Grocery store in [[Ilorin, Kwara]]]]
A retail point of sale system typically includes a [[cash register]] (which in recent times comprises a computer, monitor, cash drawer, [[receipt printer]], customer display and a barcode scanner) and the majority of retail POS systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibosocial.com/riteshmehta/pressrelease.aspx?prid=586672|title=The Point of Sale Application System for Retail Industries all Over the World|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; also include a debit/credit card reader. It can also include a [[conveyor belt]], weight scale, integrated credit card processing system, a signature capture device and a customer pin pad device. While the system may include a keyboard and mouse, more and more POS monitors use touch-screen technology for ease of use, and a computer is built into the monitor chassis for what is referred to as an all-in-one unit. All-in-one POS units liberate counter space for the retailer. The POS system software can typically handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales, returns, exchanges, layaways, [[gift cards]], gift registries, customer loyalty programs, promotions, discounts and much more. POS software can also allow for functions such as pre-planned promotional sales, manufacturer coupon validation, foreign currency handling and multiple payment types.

The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business. "Back-office" computers typically handle other functions of the POS system such as inventory control, purchasing, receiving and transferring of products to and from other locations. Other typical functions of a POS system are: store sales information for enabling customer returns, reporting purposes, sales trends and cost/price/profit analysis. Customer information may be stored for receivables management, marketing purposes and specific buying analysis. Many retail POS systems include an accounting interface that "feeds" sales and cost of goods information to independent accounting applications.

A multiple point of sale system used by big retailers like supermarkets and department stores has a far more demanding database and software architecture than that of a single station seen in small retail outlets. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.

At the same time updating between multiple stations and the backend administrative computer should be capable of being efficiently performed, so that on one hand either at the start of the day or at any time each station will have the latest inventory to process all items for sale, while on the other hand at the end of the day the backend administrative computer can be updated in terms of all sale records.

This gets even more complicated when there is a membership system requiring real-time two-way updating of membership points between sale stations and the backend administrative computer.

Retail operations such as hardware stores (lumber yards), electronic stores and so-called multifaceted superstores need specialized additional features compared to other stores. POS software in these cases handles special orders, purchase orders, repair orders, service and rental programs as well as typical point of sale functions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.primaseller.com/best-pos-software/ POS Software Features] via Primaseller&lt;/ref&gt; Rugged hardware is required for point of sale systems used in outdoor environments. Wireless devices, battery powered devices, all-in-one units, and Internet-ready machines are typical in this industry.

Recently new applications have been introduced, enabling POS transactions to be conducted using mobile phones and tablets. According to a recent study, mobile POS (mPOS) terminals are expected to replace the contemporary payment techniques because of various features including mobility, upfront low cost investment and better user experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://securebox.comodo.com/blog/pos-security/guidelines-choosing-securing-mobile-point-sale-system/ Securing Mobile Point of Sale System] via Securebox&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, the blind community in the United States engaged in structured negotiations to ensure that retail point of sale devices had tactile keypads.  Without keys that can be felt, a blind person cannot independently enter her or his PIN.  In the mid-2000s retailers began using "flat screen" or "signature capture" devices that eliminated tactile keypads.  Blind people were forced to share their confidential PIN with store clerks in order to use their debit and other PIN-based cards. The blind community reached agreement with Walmart, Target, CVS and eight other retailers that required real keys so blind people could use the devices.

===Physical configuration===

Early stores typically kept merchandise behind a counter. Staff would fetch items for customers to prevent the opportunity for theft and sales would be made at the same counter.  Self-service grocery stores such as [[Piggly Wiggly]], beginning in 1916, allowed customers to fetch their own items and pass the point of sale on the way to the exit.  Many stores have a number of cash registers for checkout, possibly now including [[self-checkout]].  This requires customers to guess which line will move the fastest, if they want to minimize their wait times; they are often frustrated to be wrong or be stuck behind another customer who encounters a problem or who takes a long time to check out.  Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/07/22/425377064/planet-money-asks-what-small-thing-would-you-do-to-improve-the-world|title=Planet Money Asks: What Small Thing Would You Do To Improve The World?|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the configuration, checkout lines usually pass by [[impulse buy]] items to grab the attention of otherwise idle customers.

==Hospitality industry==
{{Main article|Hospitality industry}}
[[File:System recepcyjny HORECA13.jpg|thumb|Reception desk POS]]
[[File:Terminale POS HORECA13.jpg|thumb|Restaurant POS]]
[[File:Tablet POS HORECA13.jpg|thumb|Tablet-based POS]]
Hospitality point of sale systems are computerized systems incorporating registers, computers and peripheral equipment, usually on a computer network to be used in restaurants, hair salons or hotels. Like other point of sale systems, these systems keep track of sales, labor and payroll, and can generate records used in accounting and [[bookkeeping]]. They may be accessed remotely by restaurant corporate offices, troubleshooters and other authorized parties.

Point of sale systems have revolutionized the restaurant industry, particularly in the fast food sector. In the most recent technologies, registers are computers, sometimes with touch screens. The registers connect to a server, often referred to as a "store controller" or a "central control unit". Printers and monitors are also found on the network. Additionally, remote servers can connect to store networks and monitor sales and other store data.

Typical restaurant POS software is able to create and print guest checks, print orders to kitchens and bars for preparation, process [[credit card]]s and other payment cards, and run reports. In addition, some systems implement wireless pagers and electronic signature-capture devices.

In the [[fast food restaurant|fast food]] industry, displays may be at the front counter, or configured for drive-through or walk-through cashiering and order taking. Front counter registers allow taking and serving orders at the same terminal, while drive-through registers allow orders to be taken at one or more drive-through windows, to be cashiered and served at another. In addition to registers, drive-through and kitchen displays are used to view orders. Once orders appear they may be deleted or recalled by the touch interface or by bump bars. Drive-through systems are often enhanced by the use of drive-through wireless (or headset) intercoms. The efficiency of such systems has decreased service times and increased efficiency of orders.

Another innovation in technology for the restaurant industry is wireless POS. Many restaurants with high volume use wireless handheld POS to collect orders which are sent to a server. The server sends required information to the kitchen in real time. Wireless systems consist of drive-through microphones and speakers (often one speaker will serve both purposes), which are wired to a "base station" or "center module." This, in turn, will broadcast to headsets. Headsets may be an all-in-one headset or one connected to a belt pack.

In hotels, POS software allows for transfer of meal charges from dining room to guest room with a button or two. It may also need to be integrated with property management software.

Newer, more sophisticated systems are getting away from the central database "file server" type system and going to what is called a "cluster database". This eliminates any crashing or system downtime that can be associated with the back office file server. This technology allows 100% of the information to not only be stored, but also pulled from the local terminal, thus eliminating the need to rely on a separate server for the system to operate.

Tablet POS systems popular for retail solutions are now available for the restaurant industry.  Initially these systems were not sophisticated and many of the early systems did not support a remote printer in the kitchen.  Tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations.  Most tablet systems upload all information to the Internet so managers and owners can view reports from anywhere with a password and Internet connection.  Smartphone Internet access has made alerts and reports from the POS very accessible.  Tablets have helped create the Mobile POS system, and Mobile POS applications also include payments, loyalty, online ordering, table side ordering by staff and table top ordering by customers. Regarding the payments, mobile POS can accept all kinds of payment methods from contactless cards, [[EMV]] chip-enabled cards, and mobile NFC enabled cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epossystemsguide.co.uk/mpos|title=mPOS {{!}}  Market-Inspector|website=www.epossystemsguide.co.uk|language=da-DK|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile POS (AKA mPOS) is growing quickly with new developers entering the market almost on a daily basis.

With the proliferation of low-priced touchscreen tablet computers, more and more restaurants have implemented self-ordering through tablet POS placed permanently on every table.  Customers can browse through the menu on the tablet and place their orders which are then sent to the kitchen. Most restaurants that have iPad self-order menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order. This apparently improves service and saves manpower on the part of the restaurant.  However this depends on how intelligently the system has been programmed to be.


As a case in point, some self-ordering systems not requiring staff assistance may not properly recognize a subsequent order from the same customer at a table.  As a result, the customer is left waiting and wondering why his second order of food and drink is not being served.

Another example of how intelligent the system can be, is whether an order that has been placed but not yet been processed by the kitchen can be modified by the customer through the tablet POS. For such an unprocessed order the customer should be given the option to easily retrieve his order and modify it on the tablet POS.  But when his order is being processed this function should then be automatically disabled.

Self-ordering systems are not always free completely from intervention by the staff and for some good reasons.  For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so.  This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered.  If alcoholic drinks are ordered, it also becomes necessary for the waiter to first verify the age of the customer before sending the order.

The technical specifications for implementing such self-ordering system are more demanding than a single cashier-controlled POS station.  On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed.  The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar.

It is therefore to be noted by developers that some databases like popularly used Ms Access may have the specifications that it is capable of usage by multiple concurrent users.  However under the stress of a POS system, they can fail miserably resulting in constant errors and corruption of data.

POS systems are often designed for a variety of clients, and can be programmed by the end users to suit their needs. Some large clients write their own specifications for vendors to implement. In some cases, POS systems are sold and supported by third-party distributors, while in other cases they are sold and supported directly by the vendor.

The selection of a restaurant POS system is critical to the restaurant's daily operation and is a major investment that the restaurant's management and staff must live with for many years. The restaurant POS system interfaces with all phases of the restaurant operation and with everyone that is involved with the restaurant including guests, suppliers, employees, managers and owners. The selection of a restaurant POS system is a complex process that should be undertaken by the restaurant owner and not delegated to an employee. The purchase process can be summarized into three steps: Design, Compare and Negotiate. The Design step requires research to determine which restaurant POS features are needed for the restaurant operation. With this information the restaurant owner or manager can Compare various restaurant POS solutions to determine which POS systems meet their requirements. The final step is to Negotiate the price, payment terms, included training, initial warranty and ongoing support costs.&lt;ref name="POS process 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.net/newsroom/pr/00077555-restaurant-pos.html|title=Restaurant POS 3-Step Purchase Process|publisher=[[Newswire]]|first=Bob|last=Frazier|date=October 16, 2013|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounting forensics==
{{Main article|Automated sales suppression device}}
POS systems record sales for business and tax purposes. Illegal software dubbed "zappers" can be used on POS devices to falsify these records with a view to evading the payment of taxes.

In some countries, legislation is being introduced to make cash register systems more secure. For example, the French treasury is estimated to be failing to collect approximately €14 billion of VAT revenue each year. The Finance Bill of 2016 is intended to address some of this loss by making it compulsory for taxpayers to operate on “secure systems”. Therefore, from 1 January 2018, all retail businesses in France are required to record customer payments using certified secure accounting software or cash register systems. 

A certified cash register system must provide for the (i) inalterability, (ii) security and (iii) storage and archiving of data. All businesses required to comply must obtain a certificate from the cash register system provider which certifies that the system meets these requirements. This is because VAT taxpayers may need to provide a certificate to the tax authorities showing that their cash management system fulfils the new requirements.

If the business cannot provide this certificate to the tax authorities, they may be fined. And, if the tax authorities can demonstrate fraudulent use of the system, both the business and the software provider can face tax penalties, fines, and criminal sanctions. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d’accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.

==Security==
Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. A dishonest cashier at a retail outlet can collude with a friend who pretends to be just another customer. During checkout, the cashier can bypass scanning certain items or enter a lower quantity for some items thus profiting thereby from the "free" goods.

The ability of a POS system to void a closed sale receipt for refund purpose without needing a password from an authorized superior also represents a security loophole. Even a function to issue a receipt with a negative amount which can be useful under certain circumstances, can be exploited by a cashier to easily lift money from the cash drawer.

In order to prevent such employee theft, it is crucial for a POS system to provide an admin window for the boss or administrator to generate and inspect a daily list of sale receipts, especially pertaining to the frequency of cancelled receipts before completion, refunded receipts and negative receipts. This is one effective way to alert the company to any suspicious activity - such as a high number of cancelled sales by a certain cashier - that may be going on and to take monitoring action.

To further deter employee theft, the sale counter should also be equipped with a [[closed-circuit television]] camera pointed at the POS system to monitor and record all the activities.

At the backend, price and other changes like discounts to inventory items through the administration module should also be secured with passwords provided only to trusted administrators. Any changes made should also be logged and capable of being subsequently retrieved for inspection.

The sale records and inventory are highly important to the business because they provide very useful information to the company in terms of customer preferences, customer membership particulars, what are the top selling products, who are the vendors and what margins the company is getting from them, the company monthly total revenue and cost, just to name some.

It is therefore important that reports on these matters generated at the administrative backend be restricted only to trusted personnel.  The database from which these reports are generated should also be secured via passwords or via encryption of data stored in the database so as to prevent them from being copied or tampered with.

Despite all such precautions and more, the POS system can never be entirely watertight in security from internal misuse if a clever but dishonest employee knows how to exploit many of its otherwise useful capabilities.

News reports on POS system hacking show that hackers are more interested in stealing credit card information than anything else.  The ease and advantage offered by the ability of a POS system to integrate credit card processing thus have a downside. In 2011,  hackers were able to steal credit card data from 80,000 customers because Subway's security and POS configuration standards for PCI Compliance - which governs credit card and debit card payment systems security - were "directly and blatantly disregarded"  by Subway franchisees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2011/12/how-hackers-gave-subway-a-30-million-lesson-in-point-of-sale-security/|title=How hackers gave Subway a $3 million lesson in point-of-sale security|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, several hundred of Wendy's fast food restaurants had their POS systems hacked by an illegally installed malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/wendys-point-of-sale-hack-grows/|title=Wendy's Point of Sale Hack Grows Bigger|first=Tara|last=Seals|date=13 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cybersecurity attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".

Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database.

In April 2017, security researchers identified critical vulnerabilities in point of sale systems developed by SAP and Oracle &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |title=SAP point-of-sale systems were totally hackable with $25 kit |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/15/sap_patch_batch_fixes_3_yr_old_vuln/ |newspaper=The Register|date=29 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented, “POS systems are plagued by vulnerabilities, and incidents occurred because their security drawbacks came under the spotlight.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://erpscan.com/research/hacking-sap-pos/|title=How to buy MacBook for $1, or hacking SAP POS - SAP Cyber Security Solutions|website=erpscan.com|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SAP POS Flaw Allows Hackers to Change Pricing |url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/sap-pos-flaw-hackers-change-pricing/|newspaper=Info Security|date=25 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If successfully exploited, these vulnerabilities provide a perpetrator with access to every legitimate function of the system, such as changing prices, and remotely starting and stoping terminals. To illustrate the attack vector, the researchers used the example of hacking POS to change the price of a MacBook to $1. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP1xHUBnAEs&amp;feature=youtu.be/|title=How to buy a MacBook for $1, or hacking SAP POS|first=|last=ERPScan inc|date=24 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The security issues were reported to the vendor, and a patch was released soon after the notification. Oracle confirmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/security-bug-affects-over-300-000-oracle-pos-systems/|title=Security Bug Affects Over 300,000 Oracle POS Systems
|first=|date=31 January 2018|publisher=Catalin Cimpanu|accessdate=31 January 2018|via=BleepingComputer
}}&lt;/ref&gt; security bug affects over 300,000 Oracle POS Systems

In some countries, credit and debit cards are only processed via [[payment terminal]]s.  Thus one may see quite a number of such terminals for different cards cluttering up a sale counter.  This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and [[debit card]] data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers.

With the launch of [[mobile payment]] particularly [[Android Pay]] and [[Apple Pay]] both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals.  However, for mobile payment to go fully mainstream, mobile devices like smartphones that are [[Near Field Communication|NFC-enabled]] must first become universal. This would be a matter of several years from the time of this writing (2017) as more and more models of new smartphones are expected to become NFC-enabled for such a purpose. For instance, iPhone 6 is fully NFC-enabled for mobile payment while iPhone 5 and older models are not.  The aforesaid disastrous security risks connected with processing payment card usage through a POS system would then be greatly diminished.

== Partner events ==

In addition to the official events for the Presidential Summit, over thirty partner organizations invited participants to outside events, highlighting how the President and the US Government have helped catalyze a long-term, sustainable conversation on entrepreneurship. During recent months, the State Department coordinated with outside organizations on these related but independent events.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/fs/2010/140951.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Events during the week of the Summit on Entrepreneurship included:

* Roundtable discussions hosted by the [[Acumen Fund]], [[Endeavor (non-profit)|Endeavor]], the [[Brookings Institution]], and the [[World Congress of Muslim Philanthropists]];
* Conferences hosted by the Middle East Center on International Cooperation, [[Vital Voices]], the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy, and the International Council for Small Business;
* Receptions hosted by the [[Kauffman Foundation]] and Businesses for Diplomatic Action / [[Entrepreneurs' Organization]];
* Public Diplomacy Luncheon and Professional Networking events hosted by Al-Mubadarah: [http://www.arabempowerment.org Arab Empowerment Initiative] in collaboration with Aspen Institute's Global Initiative on Culture and Society and
* Video screenings of Ten9Eight at the [[Library of Congress]] and [[Garbage Dreams]] at the [[World Bank]].
* The Global Technology Forum 2010, hosted by [[TechWadi]], focused on building bridges between the US and MENA to accelerate entrepreneurship.

In addition, the US Government hosted special events for delegates, including briefings on business development by the US Small Business Administration, an economic support roundtable at the US Trade and Development Agency, and a reception hosted by the State Department for delegates with the Ambassadors to the United States from delegates’ home countries.

The US Government released an interactive [[Google map]] with detailed information on each of these events, which was embedded on the websites http://www.state.gov/entrepreneurshipsummit/ and http://www.entrepreneurship.gov/summit/ and is available at https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101425100571760103462.000483f33a9087a901671&amp;ll=38.901187,-77.057676&amp;spn=0.033665,0.109863&amp;z=14

== Follow-on conferences ==

Several overseas institutions and partners have expressed an interest in hosting Follow-on Conferences to continue to advance the mission of the Entrepreneurship Summit beyond the April 26 and 27 Presidential Summit in Washington. These Follow-on Conferences will be locally or regionally focused and may focus on a specific element of advancing entrepreneurship (e.g. youth entrepreneurship, access to capital, etc.) We have told these partners that we want to be supportive of these events and acknowledge them at the Summit. We have said that we would attempt to have an appropriate USG official attend, but that we would not play any role in organizing them and would not expect to provide any funding assistance.

These Conferences have been initiated by partners who are heeding the President’s call to shared action and responsibility. Through their initiative, they will help to advance what the United States and its partners on the Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship have started. We have received Statements of Intent for the following Follow-on Conferences:

* [[UAE]]/[[Abu Dhabi]]: The Aspen Institute and the government of the UAE will host a Conference in Abu Dhabi in June 2010 on Innovation.
* [[Iraq]]: The American University of Iraq-Sulaimani will host a conference on Social Entrepreneurship in Sulaimani, Iraq in Spring 2011.
* [[Algeria]]: The U.S.-Algerian Business Council will host a Conference in Algeria on entrepreneurship in the Maghreb in September 2010.
* [[Bahrain]]: The government of Bahrain will host a Conference on innovation, investment and entrepreneurship in December 2010.
* [[France]]: The French-American Foundation has committed to host a Conference on youth entrepreneurship in disadvantaged communities late in 2010 or early in 2011.
* [[Kyrgyzstan]]: The [[American University of Central Asia]], with some Department of State support, will host a Conference on Women Entrepreneurship in Bishkek in May 2010.
* [[UAE]]/[[Dubai]]: The [[Legatum Institute]] at [[MIT]] and the [[Dubai School of Government]] hosted a Conference in Dubai on “Best Practices in Entrepreneurship Policy” in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/fs/2010/140949.htm Follow On Conferences&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, in addition to better managing client projects, [[independent contractors]] can prevent lost revenue and slow billing cycles.

As businesses grow, the size and complexity of their projects tend to increase as well.  PSA software is used to provide visibility into mid-project profitability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Those familiar with [[ERP software]] may like to think of PSA as an ERP system for service organizations.

== Types of PSA Software ==
In its simplest form, PSA software may offer only timesheet systems (including expense reporting and project management). However, in their most robust incarnation they can also include [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), [[resource management]], opportunity and [[knowledge management]].

A [[comparison of PSA systems|comparison of PSA software]] is available.

== Impact of PSA Software ==
PSA software is designed to improve the performance and profitability of professional services firms. A recent end-user survey conducted by SPI Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed significant improvement in key [[performance indicator]]s such as:
* Faster staffing and invoicing workflows
* Lower project cancellation rates
* Improved on-time, under-budget project delivery rates
* Lower revenue leakage 
* Higher resource utilization rates
* Improved project margins

The study concluded with a return on investment (ROI) model for an average 172-person professional services firm. According to the research, over a five-year horizon, the firm could expect to invest just under $200,000 in implementation and software license costs. The return, however, was estimated at nearly $23 million in increased revenue and reduced costs.

A '''Purchasing Manager''' is an employee within a [[company]], [[business]] or other [[organization]] who is responsible at some level for buying or approving the acquisition of goods and services needed by the company. Responsible for buying the best quality products, goods and services for their company at the most competitive prices, purchasing managers work in a wide range of sectors for many different organizations. The position responsibilities may be the same as that of a [[buyer]] or purchasing agent, or may include wider supervisory or managerial responsibilities. A Purchasing Manager may oversee the acquisition of materials needed for [[Manufacturing|production]], general supplies for offices and facilities, equipment, or construction contracts. A Purchasing Manager often supervises purchasing agents and buyers, but in small companies the Purchasing Manager may also be the purchasing agent or buyer. The '''Purchasing Manager''' position may also carry the title "'''Procurement Manager'''" or in the public sector, "'''Procurement Officer'''". He or she can come from both an Engineering or Economics background.

A Purchasing Manager's responsibilities may include:
* seeking reliable [[vendor (supply chain)|vendors]] or suppliers to provide quality goods at reasonable prices
* negotiating prices and contracts
* reviewing technical specifications for [[raw materials]], components, equipment or buildings
* determining quantity and timing of deliveries (more commonly in small companies)
* forecasting upcoming demand.

'''Recruitee''' is [[Software as a service]] (Saas) that functions as an [[applicant tracking system]] (ATS). It includes a careers site editor for [[employer branding]], a plugin for [[sourcing (personnel)]], [[job board]] integration, email and calendar [[synchronization]]. Within 4 months after its public launch in August 2015, Recruitee attracted over 1000 [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) and recruiting agencies worldwide.

== History ==

In 2011, Perry Oostdam met Pawel Smoczyk on [[Founder2be]], a [[social network]] that helps aspiring [[entrepreneurs]] find their [[co-founder]]. Working remotely from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Poland]], they put together their first product - a mobile activation [[game]] called GeoRun.&lt;ref name="recruitee founders"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@PerryDam/the-u-turn-of-our-startup-ae50e6599b03/  |title=The U-turn of Our Startup|date=9 December 2015 |publisher=[[Medium.com]]|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Oostdam and Smoczyk pivoted the business and built Recruitee out of their own frustration with the hassles of [[Recruitment|hiring]].&lt;ref name="recruitee pivot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.saas-invaders.co/perry-oostdam-the-story-of-a-successful-pivot/ |author=Tom Benattar |title=Perry Oostdam - The Story of A Successful Pivot|date=11 September 2015 |publisher=SaaS Invaders|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe hiring should be a team effort, not only for founders and HR alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Tim|title=Recruitee: Smart Hiring on the Cloud co-Founder Interview|url=http://sociable.co/business/recruitee-smart-hiring/|website=Sociable.co|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recruitee Makes Hiring Easy On the Cloud|url=http://thestartupmag.com/recruitee-makes-hiring-easy-cloud/|website=Startup Magazine|accessdate=3 October 2016|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its launch, Recruitee quickly became popular and got an undisclosed amount of seed funding in September 1, 2015. Its board members include Dutch entrepreneurs Robert Pijselman and Luc Brandts.&lt;ref name="fjfdfb advisory board"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamwire.com/2015/09/recruitee-com-seed-funding/122314/ |author=Sujata Sangwan |title=Hiring Platform Recruitee.com Raises Seed Round of Funding|date=8 September 2015 |publisher=iamWire|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Recruitee announced a partnership with Rockstart, an accelerator in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="talent pool partner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstart.com/blog/introducing-talent-pool/|author=Catherine |title=Introducing Talent Pool|date=20 November 2015|publisher=Rockstart|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitee set up a Talent Pool that let applicants apply to job openings from all startups that are and were affiliated with Rockstart.

Recruitee's current clients include [[Vice (magazine)]], Usabilla, and [[Vlisco]].&lt;ref name="clients"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.co/recruitee-recruiting-software-to-hire-the-best-talent-2016-02 |title=Recruitee: A Recruiting Software to Hire the Best Talent|date=5 February 2016|publisher=Tech Cocktail|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

'''Retail outsourcing''' is a form of [[business process outsourcing]] practiced in retail, logistic and restaurant business. It involves the contracting of the operations and responsibilities of transportation, cooking, customer servicing or settlement of accounts business processes to a third-party service provider. Such provider bears the ultimate responsibility for the proper execution of the designated functions at stores, warehouses or catering facilities. The service supplier carries out the internal (back office) and front office duties including [[Recruitment|recruiting]], training and legalizing human resources, tracking their job conduct, reporting and solving the problems, performing daily production tasks. Retail outsourcing is typically contracted for operational segments requiring large amounts of unskilled work force in such spheres as shipment, cash desk processing, counter servicing, bread baking, meat and fish cutting, cleaning, dish washing, packing, boxing or bundling.

Initially, the concept of retail outsourcing has been conceived in Russia. It has fully matured by the end of the 2000s. Currently, retail outsourcing is practiced by all major Russian retailers. It accounts for more than 25% of their total business operations. Even the abolition of the [[Contingent_work|contingent]] labor (2016) failed to impact these services significantly. It only put a ban on specific segments (primarily, cash desk processing) but left other parts almost intact.

[[File:SWOT en.svg|thumb|A SWOT analysis, with its four elements in a 2×2 matrix.]]
'''SWOT analysis''' (or '''SWOT matrix''') is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to  [[business]] competition or project planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWOT Analysis: Discover New Opportunities, Manage and Eliminate Threats|url=http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_05.htm|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=en|date=1006|website=www.mindtools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as the tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management|last=Dess|first=Gregory|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259927621|location=United States|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strengths and weakness are frequently internally-related, while opportunities and threats commonly focus on the external environment. The name is an acronym for the four parameters the technique examines:
* '''''S'''trengths'': characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others.
* '''''W'''eaknesses'': characteristics of the business that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others.
* '''''O'''pportunities'': elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage.
* '''''T'''hreats'':  elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project.
The degree to which the internal environment of the firm matches with the external environment is expressed by the concept of [[strategic fit]]. Identification of SWOTs is important because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the objective. First, decision-makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is ''not'' attainable, they must select a different objective and repeat the process.

Some authors credit SWOT to [[Albert S. Humphrey|Albert Humphrey]], who led a convention at the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) in the 1960s and 1970s using data from [[Fortune 500]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/brochures/dec-05.pdf|title=SWOT Analysis for Management Consulting|last=Humphrey|first=Albert|date=December 2005|work=SRI Alumni Newsletter|publisher=[[SRI International]]|authorlink=Albert S. Humphrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamplc.com/Humphsprofile.htm|title=Albert Humphrey The "Father" of TAM|publisher=TAM UK|accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Humphrey himself did not claim the creation of SWOT, and the origins remain obscure.

== Internal and external factors ==
SWOT analysis aims to identify the key internal and external factors seen as important to achieving an objective. SWOT analysis groups key pieces of information into two main categories:

# Internal factors — the ''strengths'' and ''weaknesses'' internal to the organization
# External factors — the ''opportunities'' and ''threats'' presented by the environment external to the organization

Analysis may view the internal factors as strengths or as weaknesses depending upon their effect on the organization's objectives.  What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses (distractions, competition) for another objective.  The factors may include all of the [[marketing mix|4Ps]] as well as [[personnel]], [[finance]], [[manufacturing]] capabilities, and so on.

The external factors may include [[macroeconomic]] matters, [[technological change]], [[legislation]], and sociocultural changes, as well as changes in the marketplace or in competitive position.  The results are often presented in the form of a [[Table (information)|matrix]].

SWOT analysis is just one method of [[categorization]] and has its own weaknesses. For example, it may tend to persuade its users to compile lists rather than to think about actual important factors in achieving objectives. It also presents the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats.

It is prudent not to eliminate any candidate SWOT entry too quickly. The importance of individual SWOTs will be revealed by the value of the strategies they generate.  A SWOT item that produces valuable strategies is important.  A SWOT item that generates no strategies is not important.

== Use ==
The usefulness of SWOT analysis is not limited to [[For-profit corporation|profit-seeking organizations]].  SWOT analysis may be used in any decision-making situation when a desired end-state (objective) is defined.  Examples include [[non-profit organizations]], governmental units, and individuals. SWOT analysis may also be used in pre-crisis planning and preventive [[crisis management]]. SWOT analysis may also be used in creating a recommendation during a [[viability study]]/survey.

=== Strategy building ===
SWOT analysis can be used effectively to build organizational or personal strategy.  Steps necessary to execute strategy-oriented analysis involve identification of internal and external factors (using the popular 2x2 matrix), selection and evaluation of the most important factors, and identification of relations existing between internal and external features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Martin |last2=Wijetilaka |first2=Shehan |date=26 February 2015 |title=5 tips to grow your start-up using SWOT analysis |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/entrepreneurs/tips_to_grow_your_start_up_using_eQEF8Pm8l2Q9hME9TBXvVL |location=Sydney |access-date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest good conditions in the company and allow using an ''aggressive'' strategy. On the other hand, strong interactions between weaknesses and threats could be analyzed as a potential warning and advice for using a ''defensive'' strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osita |first=Christian |last2=Onyebuchi |first2=Idoko |last3=Justina |first3=Nzekwe |date=31 January 2014 |title=Organization's stability and productivity: the role of SWOT analysis |url=http://journalijiar.com/uploads/2014-10-02_231409_710.pdf |publisher=International Journal of Innovative and Applied Research (2014) |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=23–32 |access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matching and converting ===
One way of using SWOT is matching and converting. Matching is used to find [[competitive advantage]] by matching the strengths to opportunities. Another tactic is to convert weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities. An example of a conversion strategy is to find new markets. If the threats or weaknesses cannot be converted, a company should try to minimize or avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shsu.edu/~mkt_ssm/mkt570/Chap04.ppt See for instance: Mehta, S. (2000) ''Marketing Strategy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate planning ===
As part of the development of strategies and plans to enable the organization to achieve its objectives, that organization will use a systematic/rigorous process known as [[corporate planning]]. SWOT alongside [[PEST analysis|PEST]]/[[PESTLE]] can be used as a basis for the analysis of business and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong. M. A handbook of Human Resource Management Practice (10th edition) 2006, Kogan Page, London {{ISBN|0-7494-4631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Set objectives — defining what the organization is going to do
* Environmental scanning
** Internal appraisals of the organization's SWOT — this needs to include an assessment of the present situation as well as a portfolio of products/services and an analysis of the product/service lifecycle
* Analysis of existing strategies — this should determine relevance from the results of an internal/external appraisal. This may include [[gap analysis]] of environmental factors
* Strategic Issues defined — key factors in the development of a corporate plan that the organization must address
* Develop new/revised strategies — revised analysis of strategic issues may mean the objectives need to change
* Establish [[critical success factor]]s — the achievement of objectives and strategy implementation
* Preparation of operational, resource, projects plans for strategy implementation
* Monitoring all results — mapping against plans, taking corrective action, which may mean amending objectives/strategies&lt;ref name=arms&gt;Armstrong.M  Management Processes and Functions, 1996, London CIPD  {{ISBN|0-85292-438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===
{{Main|Marketing management}}
In many competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing especially on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using SWOT analysis. Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of [[vertical integration]], historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Marketing management often finds it necessary to invest in research to collect the data required to perform accurate marketing analysis. Accordingly, management often conducts market research (alternately marketing research) to obtain this information. Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include:
* Qualitative marketing research such as focus groups
* Quantitative marketing research such as statistical surveys
* Experimental techniques such as test markets
* Observational techniques such as ethnographic (on-site) observation
* Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis.

Below is an example SWOT analysis of a market position of a small management consultancy with specialism in HRM.&lt;ref name=arms /&gt;

== In community organization ==
The SWOT analysis has been used in community work as a tool to identify positive and negative factors within organizations, communities, and the broader society that promote or inhibit successful implementation of social services and social change efforts.&lt;ref name="community tool box"&gt;{{cite web |title=Community Toolbox: Section 14. SWOT analysis |url=http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/assessment/assessing-community-needs-and-resources/swot-analysis/main |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a preliminary resource, assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a community served by a nonprofit or community organization.&lt;ref name="social work" /&gt; This organizing tool is best used in collaboration with community workers and/or community members before developing goals and objectives for a program design or implementing an organizing strategy. The SWOT analysis is a part of the planning for social change process and will not provide a strategic plan if used by itself.  After a SWOT analysis is completed, a social change organization can turn the SWOT list into a series of recommendations to consider before developing a strategic plan.&lt;ref name="our community"&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Community |url=https://www.ourcommunity.com.au/boards/boards_article.jsp?articleId=1369 |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SWOT Analysis ssw 1.png|thumb|one example of a SWOT Analysis used in community organizing]]
[[File:SWOT Analysis ssw 2.png|thumb|A simple SWOT Analysis used in Community Organizing]]

'''Strengths and weaknesses''' (''internal factors within an organization''):&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Human resources — staff, volunteers, board members, target population
* Physical resources — your location, building, equipment
* Financial — grants, funding agencies, other sources of income
* Activities and processes — programs you run, systems you employ
* Past experiences — building blocks for learning and success, your reputation in the community

'''Opportunities and threats''' (''external factors stemming from community or societal forces''):&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Future trends in your field or the culture
* The economy — local, national, or international
* Funding sources — foundations, donors, legislatures
* Demographics — changes in the age, race, gender, culture of those you serve or in your area
* The physical environment —is your building in a growing part of town? Is the bus company cutting routes?
* Legislation — do new federal requirements make your job harder...or easier?
* Local, national, or international events

Although the SWOT analysis was originally designed as an organizational method for business and industries, it has been replicated in various community work as a tool for identifying external and internal support to combat internal and external opposition.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; The SWOT analysis is necessary to provide direction to the next stages of the change process.&lt;ref name=BOOK&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkenmaier |first=Julie |title=The Practice of Generalist Social Work |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by community organizers and community members to further social justice in the context of Social Work practice.

=== Application in community organization ===

As mentioned [[SWOT analysis#top|above]], SWOT can be crucial to determining the success of a project, while factoring in funding, as well as accessibility and logic. Often, a city will spend a year weighing the [[Risk-benefit]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Pittsburg, California]] tried this out recently with the BART program. Citation: (Document). Pittsburg City, California, www.ci.pittsburg.ca.us/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Analysis of Urmia, Iran |url=http://rrrs.reviste.ubbcluj.ro/arhive/Artpdf/v10n22014/RRRS10220145.pdf |website=Reviste}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a project before they even vote on it.
==== Elements to consider ====
Elements to consider in a SWOT analysis include understanding the community that a particular organization is working with. This can be done via public forums, listening campaigns, and informational interviews. Data collection will help inform the community members and workers when developing the SWOT analysis. A needs and assets assessment is tooling that can be used to identify the needs and existing resources of the community. When these assessments are done and data has been collected, an analysis of the community can be made that informs the SWOT analysis.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

==== Steps for implementation ====
A SWOT analysis is best developed in a group setting such as a work or community meeting. A facilitator can conduct the meeting by first explaining what a SWOT analysis is as well as identifying the meaning of each term.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

One way of facilitating the development of a SWOT analysis includes developing an example SWOT with the larger group then separating each group into smaller teams to present to the larger group after set amount of time.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; This allows for individuals, who may be silenced in a larger group setting, to contribute. Once the allotted time is up, the facilitator may record all the factors of each group onto a large document such as a poster board, and then the large group,  as a collective, can go work through each of the threats and weaknesses to explore options that may be used to combat negative forces with the strengths and opportunities present within the organization and community.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; A SWOT meeting allows  participants to creatively brainstorm, identify obstacles, and possibly strategize solutions/way forward to these limitations.

==== When to use SWOT analysis ====
The uses of a SWOT analysis by a community organization are as follows: to   organize information, provide insight into barriers&lt;ref name="use and misuse"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chermack |first=Thomas J. |author2=Bernadette K. Kasshanna |title=The Use of and Misuse of SWOT analysis and implications for HRD professionals |journal=Human Resource Development International |date=December 2007 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=383–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that may be present while engaging in social change processes, and identify strengths available that can be activated to counteract these barriers.

''A SWOT analysis can be used to:''
* Explore new solutions to problems &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Identify barriers that will limit goals/objectives &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Decide on direction that will be most effective &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Reveal possibilities and limitations for change&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* To revise plans to best navigate systems, communities, and organizations
* As a brainstorming and recording device as a means of communication&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;
* To enhance "credibility of interpretation" to be used in presentation to leaders or key supporters.&lt;ref name="social work"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westhues |first=Anne |author2=Jean Lafrance |author3=Glen Schmidt |title=A SWOT analysis of social work education in Canada |journal=Social Work Education: The International Journal |year=2001 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=35–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits and advantages ===
The SWOT analysis in social work practice framework is beneficial because it helps organizations decide whether or not an objective is obtainable and therefore enables organizations to set achievable goals, objectives, and steps to further the social change or community development effort.&lt;ref name=benefits&gt;{{cite web |last=Quincy |first=Ronald |title=SWOT Analysis: Raising capacity of your organization |url=http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/Libraries/Huamin/Brochure_2.sflb |publisher=Rutgers School of Social Work |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417010302/http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/libraries/huamin/brochure_2.sflb |archivedate=2016-04-17 |accessdate=2013-02-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables organizers to take visions and produce practical and efficient outcomes that effect long-lasting change, and it helps organizations gather meaningful information to maximize their potential.&lt;ref name="benefits" /&gt; Completing a SWOT analysis is a useful process regarding the consideration of key organizational priorities, such as gender and cultural diversity and fundraising objectives.&lt;ref name="change agency"&gt;{{cite web |title=Campaigners Toolkit: Strategy |publisher=The Change Agency |url=http://www.thechangeagency.org/campaigners-toolkit/training-resources/strategy/ |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Some findings from Menon et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Menon, A. |title=Antecedents and Consequences of Marketing Strategy Making |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=63 |pages=18–40 |year=1999 |doi=10.2307/1251943 |jstor=1251943 |issue=2 |publisher=American Marketing Association |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hill and Westbrook (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hill, T. &amp; R. Westbrook |title=SWOT Analysis: It’s Time for a Product Recall |journal=Long Range Planning |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=46–52 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0024-6301(96)00095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that SWOT may harm performance and that "no-one subsequently used the outputs within the later stages of the strategy". 

Other critiques include the misuse of the SWOT analysis as a technique that can be quickly designed without critical thought leading to a misrepresentation of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within an organization's internal and external surroundings.&lt;ref name="SWOT does not need to be recalled"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=Adam |title=SWOT does not need to be recalled: It needs to be enhanced |journal=Swineburne University of Technology |year=2000 |url=http://www.westga.edu/~bquest/2000/swot1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a firm becomes preoccupied with a single strength, such as cost control, they can neglect their weaknesses, such as product quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another limitation includes the development of a SWOT analysis simply to defend previously decided goals and objectives. This misuse leads to limitations on brainstorming possibilities and "real" identification of barriers. This misuse also places the organization’s interest above the well-being of the community. Further, a SWOT analysis should be developed as a collaborative with a variety of contributions made by participants including community members. The design of a SWOT analysis by one or two community workers is limiting to the realities of the forces, specifically external factors, and devalues the possible contributions of community members.&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;

Overall, managers should remember that SWOT is a starting point for discussion and cannot, in itself, show managers how to achieve a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because the SWOT analysis is a snapshot of the firm at a particular moment in time, the analysis might obscure the fact that both the internal and external environment are rapidly changing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The SVOR alternative ==

In project management, the alternative to SWOT known by the acronym SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative. It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. The SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements at play in a given project:&lt;ref&gt;Mesly, Olivier (2017). ''Project feasibility – Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New York, NY:Taylor and Francis, CRC Press, 546 pages,  9 {{ISBN|9781498757911}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Forces !! Internal !! Mathematical link !! External
|-
| '''Positive''' || Total Forces || Total Forces given constraints = Infrastructures / Opportunities || Opportunities
|-
| '''Mathematical link''' || Vulnerabilities given constraints = 1 / Total Forces  || constant ''k'' || Opportunities  given constraints = 1 / Risks
|-
| '''Negative''' || Vulnerabilities || Risks given constraints = ''k'' / Vulnerabilities || Risks
|}
Constraints consist of: calendar of tasks and activities, costs, and norms of quality. The "''k''" constant varies with each project (for example, it may be valued at 1.3).{{cn|date=February 2018}}{{efn|Best source I could find is https://ceopedia.org/index.php/SWOT_analysis but seems unrelated.}}

== SWOT analysis in popular culture ==
=== Ads ===
Many reports have been published about the use of SWOT by real life companies, and how the idea is spreading.{{which|date=October 2018}} [[Coca-Cola (company)|Coca-Cola]] has used this in their television ads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Highlights/The_Coca-Cola_Company__A_Short_SWOT_Analysis.aspx#.Wo36ULeov4g|title=Value Line - The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research|publisher=Value Line Publishing|website=www.valueline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to effectively target a customer, such as appeal to senses.

=== Television shows ===
In the ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'' episode "Homicide" (Season 2, Episode 6), Jared Dunn ([[Zach Woods]]) introduces the Pied Piper team to SWOT analysis. Later in that episode Dinesh ([[Kumail Nanjiani]]) and Gilfoyle ([[Martin Starr]]) employ the method when deciding whether or not to inform a stunt driver that the calculations for his upcoming jump were performed incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley/season-02/6-homicide/synopsis|website=HBO|title=Synopsis: ''Silicon Valley'' - 'Homicide'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3040">The '''sales order''', sometimes abbreviated as '''SO''', is an [[Order (business)|order]] issued by a business or sole trader to a customer. A sales order may be for products and/or services. Given the wide variety of businesses, this means that the orders can be fulfilled in several ways. Broadly, the fulfillment modes, based on the relationship between the order receipt and production, are as follows:

*[[Digital copy]] – Where products are digital and inventory is maintained with a single [[digital master]]. Copies are made on demand in real time and instantly delivered to customers.
*[[Build to stock]] – Where products are built and stocked in anticipation of demand. Most products for the consumer would fall into this category
*[[Build to order]] – Where products are built based on orders received. This is most prevalent for custom parts where the designs are  known beforehand.
*[[Configure-to-order]] – Where products are configured or assembled to meet unique customer requirements, e.g. computers
*[[Engineer to order]] – Where some amount of product design work is done after receiving the order

A sales order is an internal document of the company, meaning it is generated by the company itself. A sales order should record the customer's originating [[purchase order]] which is an external document. Rather than using the customer's purchase order document, an internal sales order form allows the internal audit control of completeness to be monitored. A sequential sales order number may be used by the company for its sales order documents. The customer's PO is the originating document which triggers the creation of the sales order. A sales order, being an internal document, can therefore contain many customer purchase orders under it. In a manufacturing environment, a sales order can be converted into a [[work order]] to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.

==Electronic sales order==
Many sales orders are no longer paper-based, but rather transmitted electronically over a corporate Intranet. These sales orders may be communicated across different [[enterprise application|enterprise]] [[business application]]s. The automated sales and purchase order process enables customers to place orders 24/7, even when offices are closed.

==Common types==
*Quotes
**[[Sales quote]]
**[[Financial quote]]
*[[Invoice]]
*[[Estimation (project management)|Estimate]]
*[[spot market|Spot order]]
*Return order
*Product Number
*Rush Order

==Customer order fulfillment==
The steps involved in fulfilling the demands made in a sales order make up the [[order fulfillment]] process.

'''SigFig''' (formerly '''Wikinvest''') is an investment portal that uses the [[wiki]] format. It is available online and via an app. Wikinvest was also a winner in the 2008 [[SXSW]] Interactive Web Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/web_awards/winners/ |website=SXSW |title=Web Awards Winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wikinvest was founded in 2006 by [[Parker Conrad]] and Michael Sha.&lt;ref name=sigfig&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Mike|title=A Take-Charge Portfolio Manager|url=http://online.barrons.com/news/articles/SB50001424053111903964304577422322481308982|website=barrons.com|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2 September 2014|date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2008, the site covered over 1800 companies and over 180 economic issues, and had around 1400 contributors. 

Wikinvest also provided a [[print syndication|syndication]] service for financial [[bloggers]], the '''''Wikinvest Wire'''''. Additionally, the site's '''''WikiCharts''''' feature allowed financial charts to be annotated as well as embedded in other websites.

Contributions fell under two main categories, ''companies'' and ''concepts''. The former offered financial and business analysis on individual [[corporations]], whereas the latter examined trends in broader [[economic]] issues. In addition to being an information resource for the public, the site's [[financial analysis]] has also been cited in mainstream business publications such as the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sec.online.wsj.com/article/SB121556943553838139.html |title=Wal-Mart Will Use Show To Test New Casual Lines|work=The Wall Street Journal|date= July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SigFig==
In May 2012, Wikinvest announced that it would be a portfolio tracking and investment adviser referral service with a new name, SigFig.&lt;ref name=pando&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffith|first1=Erin|title=Wikinvest Pivots to SigFig, a Comparison Site for Investments|url=http://pando.com/2012/05/01/wikinvest-pivots-to-sigfig-a-comparison-site-for-investments/|publisher=Pando Daily|accessdate=2 September 2014|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2 June 2012, Wikinvest had 400,000 users.&lt;ref name=sigfig/&gt; Parker Conrad and Michael Sha said that Wikinvest would eventually be phased out.&lt;ref name=pando/&gt;

As of November, 2015, the Wikinvest website continues to work, but the mobile apps no longer function.  Accounts are now mirrored to SigFig.com with the same username and password as the Wikinvest website, but with new, additional features available.

'''Supervision''' is an act or instance of directing, managing, or oversight.

==Etymology ==
The [[English language|English]] noun "supervision" derives from the two [[Latin]] words "super" (above) and "videre" (see, observe).

==Spelling==
{{distinguish|Supervizion}}
The spelling is "Supervision" in Standard English of all English linguistic varieties, including North American English.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Supervision is the act or function of overseeing something or somebody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=supervizion.com|title=Supervision or Supervizion|url=http://www.supervizion.com/blog/supervision-or-supervizion/|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who performs supervision is a "supervisor", but does not always have the formal title of [[supervisor]]. A person who is getting supervision is the "supervisee".

==Theoretical scope==
Generally, supervision contains elements of providing knowledge, helping to organize tasks, enhance motivation, and monitoring activity and results; the amount of each element is varying in different contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=supervizion.com|title=Supervision or Supervizion|url=http://www.supervizion.com/blog/supervision-or-supervizion/|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of supervision==

===Academia===
In [[academia]], supervision is aiding and guiding of a postgraduate research student, [[graduate student]], or undergraduate student, in their research project; offering both moral support and scientific insight and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55889551|title=Research supervision for supervisors and their students|last=1944-|first=Remenyi, D.,|date=2004|publisher=Academic Conferences International|others=Money, Arthur H., 1941-|isbn=0954709608|location=Kidmore End|oclc=55889551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supervisor is often a senior scientist or scholar, and in some countries called [[doctoral advisor]].

===Business===
In [[business]], supervision is overseeing the work of staff. The person performing supervision could lack a formal title or carry the title [[supervisor]] or [[manager]], where the latter has wider authority.&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate            = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling===
In [[clinical supervision]], the [[psychologist]] or [[psychiatrist]] has talk sessions with another professional in the field to debrief and mentally process the patient work.
&lt;ref&gt;

| last1                 = Ladany

| accessdate            = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
In [[society]], supervision could be performed by the state or corporate entities to monitor and control its [[Citizenship|citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last1                 = Gilliom

&lt;/ref&gt; Public entities often do supervision of different activities in the nation, such as [[Bank regulation|bank supervision]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">'''TREX''' is a search engine in the [[NetWeaver|SAP NetWeaver]] integrated technology platform produced by [[SAP SE]] using [[columnar storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/abadi-column-stores.pdf|doi=10.1561/1900000024|title=The Design and Implementation of Modern Column-Oriented Database Systems|author1=Daniel Abadi|author2=Peter Boncz|author3=Stavros Harizopoulos|author4=Stratos Idreos|author5=Samuel Madden|journal=Foundations and Trends in Databases|volume=5|issue=3|year=2012|pages=197–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TREX engine is a standalone component that can be used in a range of system environments but is used primarily as an integral part of SAP products such as Enterprise Portal, Knowledge Warehouse, and '''Business Intelligence (BI, formerly [[SAP Business Information Warehouse]]).''' In SAP NetWeaver BI, the TREX engine powers the BI Accelerator, which is a plug-in appliance for enhancing the performance of [[online analytical processing]]. The name "TREX" stands for '''Text Retrieval and information EXtraction''', but it is not a registered trademark of SAP and is not used in marketing collateral.

==Search functions==

TREX supports various kinds of text search, including exact search, boolean search, wildcard search, linguistic search (grammatical variants are normalized for the index search) and fuzzy search (input strings that differ by a few letters from an index term are normalized for the index search). Result sets are ranked using term frequency-inverse document frequency ([[tf-idf]]) weighting, and results can include snippets with the search terms highlighted.

TREX supports text mining and classification using a [[vector space model]]. Groups of documents can be classified using query based classification, example based classification, or a combination of these plus keyword management.

TREX supports structured data search not only for document metadata but also for mass business data and data in SAP [[Business Objects]]. Indexes for structured data are implemented compactly using [[data compression]] and the data can be aggregated in linear time, to enable large volumes of data to be processed entirely in memory.

Recent developments include:
* A join engine to join structured data from different fields in business objects
* A fast update capability to write a delta index beside a main index and to merge them offline while a second delta index takes updates
* A [[data mining]] feature pack for advanced mathematical analysis

==History==

The first code for the engine was written in 1998 and TREX became an SAP component in 2000. The SAP NetWeaver BI Accelerator was first rolled out in 2005. As of Q1 2013, the current release of TREX is SAP NW 7.1.

== Security ==
A security vulnerability in TREX was first identified and fixed in 2015 (see SAP Security Note [https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2234226 2234226])[https://www.scmagazineuk.com/bugs-in-sap-hana-allowed-remote-code-execution/article/530856/]. The vulnerability occurred due to lack of authentication in TREXnet, an internal communication protocol. The aforementioned patch fixed the problem by removing some critical functionality.

Later on, ERPScan head of threat intelligence Mathieu Geli continued to look into the vulnerability and found that the vulnerability was still exploitable [https://erpscan.com/press-center/press-release/critical-vulnerability-affects-sap-hana-dozen-sap-applications/]. Moreover, in case of successful attack, the vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to get full control over the server without authorization [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/13/sap_trex_patch/]. The vulnerability has been finally patched via SAP Security Note 2419592.
