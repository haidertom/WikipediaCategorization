The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], which lasted from March 20 – May 1, 2003, resulted in a small number of American and [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition]] [[prisoner of war|POWs]].

==507th's wrong turn==
A majority of the prisoners of war were captured from the ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. Separated from a larger convoy, they were ambushed in the Iraqi-held town of [[Nasiriyah]] on March 23, 2003. Out of thirty-three soldiers, eleven were killed and seven captured in the fire fight. Several weapons jammed in the firefight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/world/after-the-war-inquiry-report-says-errors-and-fatigue-led-to-ambush-of-convoy.html|title=AFTER THE WAR: INQUIRY; Report Says Errors and Fatigue Led to Ambush of Convoy|last=Schmitt|first=Eric|date=7/10/2003|work=New York Times|access-date=11/3/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following soldiers were captured by Iraqi forces:

|}

==Capture==
When they surrendered, they feared the worst. Miller held out little hope for mercy. "I thought they were going to kill me," he said. "That was the first thing I asked when they captured me: 'Are 
you going to kill me?' They said no. . . . I still didn't believe them."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/14/sprj.irq.pows/index.html|title=Former POW: 'We were like Custer'|accessdate=2006-12-18 |publisher=CNN|date=April 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraqi TV Interview==
Soon after their capture, Jessica Lynch was taken to an Iraqi hospital due to her serious injuries. The other five POWs did not know about Lynch surviving until after they were released.  After their capture, the five remaining members of the ambushed 507th would become famous as bloody and beaten. They were then interviewed by Iraq TV, and the footage was shown worldwide by [[Al Jazeera]]. In the interview, [[Patrick Miller (soldier)|Private First Class Patrick Miller]] was asked why he came to Iraq; his reply was "I come to fix broke stuff." Asked if he came to shoot Iraqis, he answered, "No, I come to shoot only if I am shot at. They don't bother me, I don't bother them."
&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-23-pows-iraq-usat_x.htm|title=Iraq puts captive troops on TV|accessdate=2006-12-18 |agency=Associated Press|date=March 24, 2003|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two More Makes Eight==
On March 24, they were joined by Chief Warrant Officers David Williams, 31, and [[Ron Young (US Army officer)|Ronald Young Jr.]], 26, whose Apache chopper, from the 1-227 Helicopter Attack Battalion, had been shot down in central Iraq during the [[2003 attack on Karbala|attack on Karbala.]]

==Relocation==
The prisoners were taken to [[Baghdad]], where they were isolated in separate cells of a drab [[prison]] with concrete walls and a tin roof. As American troops got closer, the soldiers were shuffled from building to building. The Iraqi captors worked feverishly to stay one step ahead of the advancing units.

==Rescue==
As it became clear that the war was over for the Iraqis, some of their captors approached a Marine unit from the [[3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion|3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, Delta Co., 3rd Platoon]] which was a part of [[Task Force Tripoli]] that had been pushing up toward [[Tikrit]], [[Saddam Hussein]]'s hometown.  A Marine battalion was sent to check on the intelligence and found the seven POWs with a confused Iraqi guard unit, whose officers had fled.

On April 13, 2003, 21 days after the 507th members were captured, the 3rd Light Armored Recon Marines burst in on the Iraqi guards who gave up without a fight.  Ordering everyone on the floor, a Marine gave an order to "stand up if you're American!"  Given dirty prison clothes and fed little food, the prisoners lost a lot of weight and with their garb, and beards they looked like Iraqis.  "At first," [[Shoshana Johnson|Spc. Shoshana Johnson]] remembers that, "they didn't realize I was American. They said, 'Get down, get down,' and one of them said, 'No, she's American.' "&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/04/14/MN252903.DTL|title=Freedom for 7 American POWs|accessdate=2006-12-18 |last=Peter Baker, Washington Post|date=
April 14, 2003|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours, the seven were on their way to Kuwait International Airport inside a Marine Corps KC-130 transport plane, the first stop before the United States. Amid sobs, cheers and laughter, they told their stories to two reporters accompanying them on the flight.  "I broke down. I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm home,'" Johnson said.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

==War crimes==
During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Iraqi [[Saddam Fedayeen]] irregular forces were involved in executing several Coalition prisoners of war.

Sergeant [[Donald Walters]] was initially reported to have been killed in the March 23 ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. However, witnesses later reported that they had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters' blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/05/27/iraq.pow/index.html Status changed for soldier killed in Iraq: Investigation shows POW was murdered - CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Lynch]] was reportedly raped and sodomized by Iraqi forces, based on scars, though she has no recollection of it happening.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/07/usa.iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on March 23, a British Army engineering unit made a wrong turn near the town of [[Az Zubayr]], which was still held by Iraqi forces. The unit was ambushed and Sapper Luke Allsopp and Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth became separated from the rest. Both were captured and executed by Iraqi forces. In 2006, a video of Allsopp lying on the ground surrounded by Iraqi irregular forces was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1530205/Soldier-killed-in-convoy-ambush-'was-alive-for-four-hours-surrounded-by-mob'.html Soldier killed in convoy ambush 'was alive for four hours surrounded by mob' - The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine Sergeant Fernando Padilla-Ramirez was reported missing from his supply unit after an ambush north of [[Nasiriyah]] on March 28. His body was later dragged through the streets of [[Ash Shatrah]] and hung in the town square. His body was later taken down and buried by sympathetic locals. His body was discovered by American forces on April 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special45/articles/profiles-part1.html |title=Invasion: Into the breach |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2006-08-04 |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID%3D3750 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910142414/http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=3750 |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright 2004, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the showing of captured soldiers on television, as was done with some of the captured soldiers of the [[507th Maintenance Company]], was a violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]].

[[File:Roussillon - Carte de Nicolas de Fer (1706).jpg|thumb|Map of the province of Roussillon by Nicolas de Fer (1706)]]
  
The '''Angelets''', or “the Angelets of the Earth” (in Catalan, ''“els Angelets de la Terra”''), were peasants who rose up from 1667 to 1675 against the French authorities of the [[Roussillon]] province. The group of conflicts of the period is subsumed under the name of “the '''Revolt of the Angelets'''”. The cause was the instituting of the [[gabelle]] (salt tax) in 1661 — a measure contrary to traditional constitutions of the earldom (the earldom of Roussillon and [[Cerdanya]], the lands of the crown of [[Majorca]] from 1276 to 1344).

The revolt first concerned the county of [[Vallespir]], then it won those of [[Conflent]] and Roussillon.

== The name ==

[[File:Guido Reni 031.jpg|thumb|The archangel of Saint Michael]]
The reason why the revolts are referred to as “angelets” is unknown. One of the explanations advanced is the popular belief according to which the angels know the mountains well; another is the faculty that they have of appearing and disappearing.

As for the word ''“miquelets,”'' it refers primarily to Catalan mercenaries but sometimes to armed peasants. There is thus confusion among the ancient authors, particularly in relation to the war of Holland: They designate under the name “''miquelets''” all those who, in the province of Roussillon, oppose the king of France — though it be angelets or Catalan mercenaries in the service of the king of Spain.

[[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] is the patron saint of the miquelets and the wool-workers of [[Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste|Prats-de-Mollo]], he who gave a sacred tint to one revolt that reclaimed liberties with the patriotic cry of ''“Visca la terra!”'' (“Long live the Land!”)

== Context ==

On May 8, 1659, the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] came to an end, and on November 7, the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] was signed between the Spanish and the French monarchies. The agreement notably foresaw a sharing of the principality of Catalonia between the two sovereigns. The crown of France annexed five [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] (corresponding to the two [[Counts]], minus lower Cerdanya and [[Llívia]]):

* the comarque of Roussillon
* Vallespir
* Conflent
* [[Capcir]]
* the burghs and villages of [[French Cerdagne]], that is the east of the count of Cerdagne

[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] engaged himself with respecting the local customs.  But, since June 1660, he replaced Catalan institutions and agencies with his own political, judiciary, and fiscal structures.  He created a sovereign Council at [[Perpignan]]. Then he named a steward.

Resistance to the new master began in March 1661. Having come to settle a disagreement between the inhabitants of [[Ayguatébia-Talau|Ayguatébia]] and those of [[Oreilla]], the viguier (magistrate) Marsal was violently attacked.  He succeeded in escaping, but the notary and the domestic who accompanied him were killed.  Immediately, the comarque of Conflent was subjected to a tax intended to pay the sometent français (the militia).

=== The Gabelle ===

The [[gabelle]], a tax on salt, had been abolished by the Catalan courts since the time of King [[James II of Majorca]], in 1283. In 1661, the French reestablished it. Its revenue was intended to finance the maintenance and construction of fortresses, as well as the payment of French functionaries. The measure was very unpopular. The king of France’s misuse of this tax’s revenue — to the detriment of Perpignan, which was only cashing an insignificant part of it — was considered an abjuration of the royal oath to respect the capital privileges of the comarque of Roussillon. The consuls of Perpignan protested. But the sovereign Council’s decision rejected the municipal complaint and imposed the will of the Louvre.

In Vallespir, a country of pastures, salt was necessary for feeding livestock and preserving meat. The inhabitants sent for it from the other side of the wholly new border. The tax made its price rise inordinately. In 1667, the peasants of Vallespir refused to pay it.

== The First Revolt (1667–68) ==

Smuggling was organized. The inspectors tracked down the traffickers in order to try to put an end to this activity. The peasants reacted, transforming themselves into veritable guerrilla fighters, harassing the French soldiers and especially the functionaries of the salt tax. An armed resistance was organized under the leadership of Joseph of Trinxeria, a merchant of Prats-de-Mollo.

The insurgents spread themselves in the county of Vallespir. In 1667, they hid in the villages of [[Serralongue]] and [[Montferrer]]. The following year, they attacked the hotel of [[Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda|Amélie-les-Bains]], where the tax collectors are housed. They besieged the deputy provost Maniel in the church of [[Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans]]. The repression did not rest: eight inhabitants were condemned to death and 51 put into slavery. This did nothing to discourage the smugglers.

The president of the sovereign Council, the collaborator Francesc de Segarra, offered a reward of 100 gold ''doubles tournois'' (coins) to whoever would give information against the leaders of the resistance. On September 14, 1668, he left with 300 soldiers to make base at [[Arles]] in order to begin a harsh suppression. The punitive expedition was routed at Llop pass and had to retreat to Arles.

For several years, the rebels, knowing the terrain well, inflicted substantial losses on the French troops.   From August 3, 1667 to June 30, 1668, they also pursued and eliminated a good number of salt tax inspectors.

The authorities of the salt tax resolved to negotiate: The armed struggle ceased and, in exchange, the townships of Vallespir could obtain smuggled salt. Through the “Compromise of [[Céret]],” the salt tax inspectors began to put an end to the controls and to coordinate with the council of each village, as to who would be charged from then on with the distribution of salt to the inhabitants.

== The Second Revolt (1670–74) ==

[[File:1674 - Plan bataille Maureillas.jpg|thumb|Battle plan near Maureillas in 1674]]
In 1669, in Conflent, Joan Miquel Mestre, called “the Righteous Heir,” demanded a similar arrangement for [[Baillestavy]]. From September to November, he kept track of the customs officers. It was at that moment that the revolts were referred to under the name of “angelets.”  Mestre was stopped by chance on the road from [[Camprodon]] on January 22, 1670 by the governor of Prats-de-Mollo. This set off a revolt on the part of the inhabitants, led by Josep de la Trinxeria and his lieutenant Damià Nohell, son of the mayor of Serralongue. They took the governor’s wife and children hostage and negotiated their release in return for that of the Righteous Heir. The exchange completed, the angelets returned via [[Tech (river)|the Tech]], seeing their troops grow to 1,500 men.

At this moment the revolt not only began again but also intensified considerably. The fighting stretched to all of Vallespir: On February 27, 1670, the insurgents seized Arles, from which they chased the garrison and killed the mayor. From March 31 to April 2, they besieged Céret, the capital of Vallespir.

The angelets held the high valley of Tech as well as Conflent. This was when the French sent an army of 4,000 soldiers. Avoiding offering an easy target on the route from the valley, they progressed through the mountains of Haut-Conflent that separated the two comarques, in order to take Vallespir from the rear. The technique of guerrilla warfare did not allow for maintaining a lined-up battle, on open terrain, facing a complete army: On May 5, the angelets were defeated at the Queen’s Pass, at the food of the Guillem Flat.   Some took refuge in the principality of Catalonia; others hid in the mountains.   The last bastion of the angelets having been defeated, the village of Py was sentenced to be razed.   Salt had to be scattered over its ruins.

=== Beginnings of the War of Holland ===

Hostilities were revived by the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–78), of which the Spanish front became one of the theaters. The struggle of the population then took the character of an anti-French uprising. The angelets collaborated with the Spanish monarchy (1673).

The village and church of Ayguatébia were burned by French troops on February 7, 1673.

The year 1674 was particularly difficult for the French, in the province of Roussillon. They would face conspiracies (Villefranche and Perpignan) and an entry of Spanish troops.

=== The Villefranche Conspiracy ===

The angelets were involved in the Villefranche Conspiracy, which aimed to reunite the Counties at the principality of Catalonia, on “Holy Saturday” in 1674.

The conspiracy was discovered. Its leader, Manuel Descatllar, was arrested. He was transferred to Perpignan where, under terrible torture, he confessed all his activities. He was executed in the square of [[La Loge, Pas-de-Calais|La Loge]] on April 20, 1674. As for his companion Francesc Puig i Terrats, he was condemned to death and had his throat cut in public, in front of his own house, on May 16. His body was quartered. The four parts of him were exhibited at four points in the city. Many other conspirators paid for their involvement through the loss of their civic and patrimonial rights.

=== Repression and End of the Revolt ===

The population was always in question. The king of Spain’s troops crossed the frontier and took the fort of Bellegarde (beginning 1674). They controlled a great part of the province (Cerdagne and Vallespir, a part of Roussillon and of Conflent) after they won the [[Battle of Maureillas]] over the French army on July. It was only in 1675 that the [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Count of Schomberg]], taking advantage of the Spanish withdrawal of troops to face the recent [[Revolt of Messina]], took back Bellegarde and routed them once and for all.

The region was now overrun with the French troops. The repression reached the whole population: imprisonment, sentencing to the galleys, executions, confiscation of goods, and heavy fines imposed on the communes (that of Prats-de-Mollo was of 3,500 pounds, that of Saint-Laurent was of 1,600 pounds).

The revolt of the angelets was considered finished in 1675.

The hatreds were so exacerbated, and the cost of suppression was so high, that Louis XIV tried to exchange the Counties in return for Flanders. But [[Charles II of Spain]] refused.

The revolt being completely put out, the king of France renounced this exchange during negotiations of the [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]], which put an end, in 1678, to the Franco-Dutch War.

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]] wrote [[Confessions (Augustine)|''Confessions'']], the first Western autobiography ever written, around 400. Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century.]]
An '''autobiography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]], αὐτός-''autos'' self +  βίος-''bios'' life + γράφειν-''graphein'' to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word "autobiography" was first used deprecatingly by [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]] in 1797 in the [[English language|English]] [[Periodical publication|periodical]] ''The [[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'', when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as "pedantic". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by [[Robert Southey]] in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that "[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time".&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;{{cite book|last = Pascal| first = Roy|title = Design and Truth in Autobiography|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1960 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] | pages = | url =| doi =| id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The [[memoir]] form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life.&lt;ref name=Pascal/&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Life ===

Autobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.

=== Spiritual autobiography ===
Spiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as [[Zahid Rohari]]'s ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|An Autobiography]]'' and ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]''. The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.

=== Memoirs ===
{{Main article|Memoir}}

A memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the "life and times" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', also known as ''Commentaries on the Gallic Wars''. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the [[Gallic Wars]]. His second memoir, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (or ''Commentaries on the Civil War'') is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in [[Caesar's civil war|the civil war]] against [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Gnaeus Pompeius]] and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. 

[[Leonor López de Córdoba]] (1362–1420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir [[Edmund Ludlow]] and Sir [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet|John Reresby]]. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of [[Jean François Paul de Gondi, cardinal de Retz|Cardinal de Retz]] (1614–1679) and the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]].

=== Fictional autobiography ===
The term "fictional autobiography" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is an early example. [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' is another such classic, and [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., [[Robert Nye]]'s ''Memoirs of [[Lord Byron]]''.

== Autobiography through the ages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

=== The classical period: Apologia, oration, confession ===

In antiquity such works were typically entitled ''[[wikt:apology|apologia]],'' purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. [[John Henry Newman]]'s Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in reference to this tradition.

The Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] introduces his autobiography (''Josephi Vita'', c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mason, Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary. Life of Josephus : translation and commentary, Volume 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] [[Libanius]] (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (''Oration I'' begun in 374) as one of his [[Public speaking|orations]], not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430) applied the title ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' to his autobiographical work, and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] used the same title in the 18th century,  initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era and beyond.  Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. It tells of the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage [[Manichaeism]] in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to [[Christianity]] due to his embracement of [[philosophical scepticism|Skepticism]] and the [[New Academy]] movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology&lt;ref&gt;Fiorenza and Galvin (1991), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Confessions'' will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Henry|title=Confessions|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199537822|pages=4 (ix)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of Augustine's ''Confessions'' is the 12th-century ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' of [[Peter Abelard]], outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.

=== Early autobiographies ===

[[File:Baburnama.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the ''[[Baburnama]]'']]

In the 15th century, [[Leonor López de Córdoba]], a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her ''Memorias'', which may be the first autobiography in [[Spanish language|Castillian]].

[[Babur|Zāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur]], who founded the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] of [[South Asia]] kept a journal ''[[Baburnama|Bāburnāma]]'' ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]/{{lang-fa|بابر نامہ}}; literally: ''"Book of Babur"'' or ''"Letters of Babur"'') which was written between 1493 and 1529.

One of the first great autobiographies of the [[Renaissance]] is that of the sculptor and goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply ''Vita'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Life''). He declares at the start: "No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty."&lt;ref&gt;Benvenuto Cellini, tr. George Bull, ''The Autobiography'', London 1966 p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.

Another autobiography of the period is ''De vita propria'', by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1574).

It is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|Book of Margery Kempe]]'', describing among other things [[Margery Kempe|Kempe's]] pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] and visit to [[Rome]] although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.

Possibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captan John Smith's autobiography published in 1630 &lt;ref&gt;The True Travels, Adventures and Observations of Captain John Smith into Europe, Aisa, Africa and America from Anno Domini 1593 to 1629&lt;/ref&gt; which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's "tall tales", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted. &lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Philip L (1964) The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Other notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] (1643, published 1764) and [[John Bunyan]] (''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'', 1666).

[[Jarena Lee]] (1783 – 1864), was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Doers_of_the_Word.html?id=jrirQL5L0xgC|title=Doers of the Word: African-American Women Speakers and Writers in the North (1830-1880)|last=Peterson|first=Carla L.|date=1998|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813525143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
[[File:Memoirs of Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of the first English edition of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s autobiography, 1793]]
Following the trend of [[Romanticism]], which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. [[Stendhal]]'s autobiographical writings of the 1830s, ''[[The Life of Henry Brulard]]'' and ''[[Memoirs of an Egotist]]'', are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Stendhal|last=Wood|first=Michael|date=1971|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801491245|location=Ithaca, NY|page=97}}&lt;!--|access-date=July 21, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An English example is [[William Hazlitt]]'s ''Liber Amoris'' (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.

With the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], but also politicians (e.g. [[Henry Brooks Adams]]), philosophers (e.g. [[John Stuart Mill]]), churchmen such as [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], and entertainers such as [[P. T. Barnum]]. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of "Cellinian" autobiography.
&lt;!-- work in progress—to be developed --&gt;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
From the 17th century onwards, "scandalous memoirs" by supposed [[libertine]]s, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically [[pseudonym]]ous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by [[ghostwriter]]s. So-called "autobiographies" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a [[ghostwriter]], are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as [[Naomi Campbell]], admit to not having read their "autobiographies".{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.

Autobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. ''[[A Fortunate Life]]'' by [[Albert Facey]] (1979) has become an Australian literary classic.&lt;ref&gt;about-australia.com.au, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as ''[[Angela’s Ashes]]'' and ''[[The Color of Water]]'', more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.

A genre where the "claim for truth" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is [[autofiction]].

Furthermore, in the latter years new impulses at the Autobiographical genre arrived from the italian poet and critic Menotti Lerro. In contrast to what Philippe Lejeune asserts Lerro claims that if the truth can only be grasped in a synchronic manner (also according to postmodernist philosophers point of view) and through fragments, why not entrust this narrative to the verse? Why not consider the role of “autobiography in verse” equally dignified as a form of self-narration? For the critic this, perhaps, is the necessary leap: through poetry it is possible to get the most dramatic and highest form of autobiographical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Menotti Lerro, Autobiographical Poetry in England and Spain (1950-1980): Narrating Oneself in Verse (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2017), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biographical film''', or '''biopic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|əʊ|p|ɪ|k}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forvo.com/word/biopic/#en|title=biopic pronunciation: How to pronounce biopic in English, German|first=Forvo|last=Team|date=|website=forvo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviation for ''biographical motion picture''), is a film that dramatizes the life of a [[non-fictional]] or [[historically]]-based person or people. Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used.&lt;ref name=bas2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastin|first=Giselle|title=Filming the Ineffable: Biopics of the British Royal Family|journal=Auto/Biography Studies|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/abs/summary/v024/24.1.bastin.html|date=Summer 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=34–52|accessdate=29 May 2013|doi=10.1353/abs.2009.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from films "[[docudrama|based on a true story]]" or "[[historical drama film]]s" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.{{Original research inline|date=October 2015}}

Because the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Jamie Foxx]] all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics:{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Ben Kingsley as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), Depp as [[Ed Wood]] in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), Carrey as [[Andy Kaufman]] in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999), and Foxx as [[Ray Charles]] in ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'' (2004).

In rare cases, sometimes called '''auto biopics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/autobiopic|title=autobiopic - definition of autobiopic in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the subject of the film plays himself or herself: [[Jackie Robinson]] in ''[[The Jackie Robinson Story]]''; [[Muhammad Ali]] in ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]''; [[Audie Murphy]] in ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]''; [[Patty Duke]] in ''[[Call Me Anna (film)|Call Me Anna]]''; [[Bob Mathias]] in ''[[The Bob Mathias Story]]'', [[Arlo Guthrie]] in ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]''; [[Fantasia Barrino]] in ''[[Life Is Not a Fairytale: The Fantasia Barrino Story|Life Is Not a Fairytale]]''; and [[Howard Stern]] in ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.

Biopic scholars include [[George F. Custen]] of the [[College of Staten Island]] and [[Dennis P. Bingham]] of [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]]. Custen, in ''Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History'' (1992), regards the genre as having died with the [[Studio system|Hollywood studio era]], and in particular, [[Darryl F.

The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=2010 |oclc=318970570 |isbn=9780813546582}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by [[Rick Altman]] in his study, ''[[Film/Genre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Film/genre |last=Altman |first=Rick |year=1999 |publisher=British Film Institute |page= |oclc=41071380 |isbn=9780851707174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's ''Bio-Pics: a life in pictures'' (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheshire |first=Ellen |title=Bio-Pics: a life in pictures |page= |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2014 |oclc= |isbn=9780231172059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, "Taking Hollywood Back" in the 2009 issue of ''Cinema Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robé |first=Christopher |title=Taking Hollywood Back: The Historical Costume Drama, the Biopic, and Popular Front U.S. Film Criticism |jstor=20484449 |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2009 |pages=70–87 |doi=10.1353/cj.0.0082}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Anchor|Ebert}} [[Roger Ebert]] defended ''The Hurricane'' and distortions in biographical films in general, stating "those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. ... ''The Hurricane'' is not a [[Documentary film|documentary]] but a [[parable]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hurricane-2000 |date=January 7, 2000 |title=The Hurricane |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|stretch}} Some biopics purposely stretch the truth. ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'' was based on [[game show]] host [[Chuck Barris]]' widely debunked yet popular [[memoir]] of the same name, in which he claimed to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,404266,00.html|title=Chuck Barris: Lying to Tell the Truth |last=Stein |first=Joel |date=2003-01-07 |newspaper=Time |issn=0040-781X |access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kafka (film)|Kafka]]'' incorporated both the life of author [[Franz Kafka]] and the [[surrealism|surreal]] aspects of his fiction.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The [[Errol Flynn]] film ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' tells the story of [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]] but is highly romanticized. The [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', mainly about [[Jim Morrison]], was highly praised for the similarities between Jim Morrison and actor [[Val Kilmer]], look-wise and singing-wise, but fans and band members did not like the way Val Kilmer portrayed Jim Morrison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary James' Interview with Ray Manzarek |url= http://www.classicbands.com/RayManzarekInterview.html |publisher=Classicbands |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few of the scenes were even completely made up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crystal-ship.com/entrevues.php?cht=03 |title=Chat with Ray Manzarek |publisher=Crystal-ship|date=17 November 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. [[Anthony Hopkins]] felt that he should not have played [[Richard Nixon]] in ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' because of a lack of resemblance between the two.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The casting of [[John Wayne]] as [[Genghis Khan]] in ''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], an African American actor, as Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] in the 1982 TV miniseries ''[[Sadat (film)|Sadat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/movies/upset-by-sadat-egypt-bars-columbia-films.html|title=UPSET BY 'SADAT,' EGYPT BARS COLUMBIA FILMS|last=Times|first=Judith Miller, Special To The New York|date=1984-02-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some objected to the casting of [[Jennifer Lopez]] in ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'' because she is a New York City native of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] descent while [[Selena]] was [[Mexican-American]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Kathleen (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">When studying [[literature]], '''biography and its relationship to literature''' is often a subject of [[literary criticism]], and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use [[biography]] or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: '''literary biography''' and [[biographical criticism]]. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, [[biographical novel|biographical fiction]] and [[autofiction|autobiographical fiction]].

==Literary biography==
A literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt;&lt;ref name = karl&gt;Karl, Frederick R. "Joseph Conrad" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 69–88&lt;/ref&gt; Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through [[psychoanalytic theory]].&lt;ref name = karl/&gt;

Literary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of [[Wilfrid Blunt]], noted, "Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use."&lt;ref name= longford&gt;Longford, Elizabeth "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt" of Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, "Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste.... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends."&lt;ref name = meyers&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey "Introduction" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-received literary biographies include [[Richard Ellmann]]'s ''James Joyce'' and [[George Painter]]'s ''Marcel Proust''.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113&gt;Backschneider 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = meyers/&gt;

==Biographical criticism==
{{main|Biographical criticism}}
Biographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Benson| first = Jackson J| year = 1989| jstor = 25111810| title = Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism| journal = College Literature| issue = 16| volume = 29| pages = 107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical fiction==
{{see also|Biographical novel|Biographical film}}
Biographical fiction is a type of [[historical fiction]] that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for "truthful" representation is less strict than in [[biography]]. 

The various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]''. Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s ''[[To the Hermitage]]'' and [[Michael Cunningham]]'s ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]''. No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.&lt;ref name="mullan" /&gt;

Biographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people,  but without direct reference to them, such as [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'' (1885) and [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.&lt;ref name = mullan&gt;{{cite news| title = Heavy on the source John Mullan analyses The Master by Colm Tóibín. Week three: biographical fiction| first = John| last = Mullan| newspaper =The Guardian| date = 30 April 2005| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/30/fiction.colmtoibin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autobiographical fiction==
{{main|Autofiction}}
{{see also|Autobiographical novel|Autobiographical comics}}
Autobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.&lt;ref name = bragg&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5668638.ece| newspaper = The Sunday Times| date = 8 February 2009| title = Melvyn Bragg on autobiographical fiction| accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Galahad]], Bors the Younger, and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail ([[Edward Burne-Jones]] C. 1895)]]

'''Bors''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|z}}; {{lang-fr|Bohort}}) is the name of two knights in the [[Arthurian legend]], one the father of the other. Bors the Elder is the King of Gaunnes or [[Gaul]] during the early period of [[King Arthur|King Arthur's]] reign, and is the brother of [[King Ban]] of Benoic. The two first appear in the 13th-century [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle. Bors the Younger later becomes one of the best [[Round Table|Knights of the Round Table]], and even achieves the [[Holy Grail]].

==King Bors the Elder==
As Ban's brother, King Bors is [[Lancelot|Lancelot's]] and [[Hector de Maris|Hector de Maris']] uncle. He marries [[Evaine]], the sister of Ban's wife [[Elaine (legend)|Elaine]], and has two sons, Bors the Younger and [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]. Ban and Bors become Arthur's early allies in his fight against eleven rebel kings in [[Great Britain|Britain]], including [[King Lot|Lot]], [[Urien]], and [[Caradoc]], and he vows to help them against their enemy [[Claudas]], who has been threatening their lands. Arthur is late on his promise, however, and Claudas succeeds in his invasion, resulting in both kings' deaths. Ban's son Lancelot is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], but Bors' children are raised in captivity by Claudas' retainers.

==Sir Bors the Younger==
Sir Bors the Younger is better known than King Bors throughout Arthurian studies. Sir Bors and Lionel live for several years at Claudas' court. But they eventually rebel against him and even slay his cruel son Dorin. Before Claudas can retaliate, the boys are rescued by a servant of the Lady of the Lake and are spirited off to be raised with their cousin Lancelot. All three grow to be excellent knights and go to [[Camelot]] to join King Arthur's retinue. Bors is recognizable by a distinctive scar on his forehead, and participates in most of the King's conflicts, including the eventual battle with Claudas that liberates his father's lands. Bors fathers Sir [[Elyan the White]] when the daughter of King Brandegoris tricks him into sleeping with her by way of a magic ring; he later introduces his son into the Round Table.

[[Image:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|right|Bors chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother Lionel]]

Bors is always portrayed as one of the Round Table's finest, but his real glory comes on the [[Grail Quest]], where he proves himself worthy enough to witness the Grail's mysteries alongside [[Galahad]] and [[Percival]]. Several episodes display his virtuous character; in one, a lady approaches Bors vowing to commit suicide unless he sleeps with her. He refuses to break his vow of [[celibacy]]; the lady and her maidens threaten to throw themselves off the castle battlements. As the ladies jump off, they reveal themselves to be demons set on deceiving him by playing to his sense of compassion. In another, Bors faces a dilemma where he must choose between rescuing his brother Lionel, being whipped with thorns by villains in one direction, and saving a young girl who has been abducted by a rogue knight in the other. Bors chooses to help the maiden, but prays for his brother's safety. Lionel escapes his tormentors and tries to murder Bors, and Bors does not defend himself, refusing to raise a weapon against his kinsman. Fellow Knight of the Round Table Sir [[Calogrenant]] and a religious hermit try to intervene, but Lionel slays them both when they get in the way. Before he can kill his brother, however, God strikes him down with an immobilizing column of fire. Bors, Galahad, and Percival go on to achieve the Holy Grail and accompany it to [[Sarras]], a mystical island in the [[Middle East]]. Both Galahad and Percival pass away while there; Bors is the only one to return.

In [[Thomas Malory|Thomas Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Sir Bors agrees to fight as Guinevere's champion when she is accused of poisoning a knight. Bors is reluctant, as her first choice, Lancelot, left Camelot because of Guinevere. He relents when Arthur sees Guinevere kneeling before him.  He is about to joust for her sake when Lancelot arrives to take his place.

Like the rest of his family, Bors joins Lancelot in exile after his affair with [[Guinevere]] is exposed, and helps rescue the Queen from her execution at the stake. Bors becomes one of Lancelot's most trusted advisors in the ensuing war between Lancelot and Arthur, and becomes ruler of Claudas' former lands. When Arthur and [[Gawain]] must return to Britain to fight the evil usurper [[Mordred]], Gawain sends a letter to Lancelot asking for aid. Lancelot's men arrive to put down the remainder of the rebellion led by Mordred's sons [[Sons of Mordred|Melehan and Melou]]; Lionel is killed by Melehan, and Bors avenges his death.

==Modern portrayals==
*In [[T.H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Bors is described as a "misogynist" and an "almost-virgin", and generally something of a curmudgeon.
*In 1975's ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', Sir Bors (played by [[Terry Gilliam]]) is the first Knight of the Round Table to succumb to the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog|Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. Arthur, dismissive of the Rabbit despite Tim the Enchanter's warnings, orders Bors to kill the Rabbit to demonstrate that it is of no threat. However, the Rabbit leaps through the air and onto Sir Bors, and he is quickly decapitated before he can attempt a single blow.
*In 2004's ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', British actor [[Ray Winstone]] plays a different Bors. He is one of the Sarmatian 'knights', and is brash, bold and violent in a departure from the saintly earlier figure. He is brother to [[Dagonet]]; has a native lover Vanora, and more than ten illegitimate children. [[Vanora]] is believed to be an early identity of Guenevere; the Vanora of the film is also some-time mistress to fellow Sarmatian knight Lancelot, who is strongly hinted to be the father of Bors' youngest child, and possibly others (for example Gilly, the eldest), as they have dark hair whereas neither of their parents do.
*In ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'', a Columbia serial from 1949, Sir Bors is played by [[Charles King (character actor)|Charles King]] as a comedy relief sidekick for Galahad.

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

===Television===
*[[B. A. Baracus]] is afraid of flying: ''[[The A-Team]]''
*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''
*[[Drake Mallard|Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard]] has a big ego. ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''
*[[Peter Griffin]] is extremely impulsive and causes many problems for his family and friends: ''[[Family Guy]]''
*[[Zuko]] makes misguided decisions in an effort to gain his cruel father's acceptance: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

[[File:Coat of arms of Joseph Ratzinger.svg|thumb|right|250px|The coat of arms of Cardinal Ratzinger]]

The [[papal coats of arms|personal papal coat of arms]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was designed by Archbishop [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]] (who was later created a Cardinal) soon after the [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal election in 2005]].

==Shield==
The shape of the [[shield (heraldry)|shield]] varies from artist to artist. In the official rendering of the coat of arms of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] the shape chosen is that of a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]].

===Blazon===
The [[blazon]] (the written description, in terminology peculiar to heraldry, of the contents of the coat of arms) given on the Vatican [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html website] is as follows:
:''Gules, chape ployé Or, with the scallop shell Or; the dexter chape with a moor's head Proper, crowned and collared Gules, the sinister chape a bear trippant (*passant) Proper, carrying a pack Gules belted Sable.'
This means, in non-technical English:
: A red shield mantled in gold and with a gold scallop shell; the right (for the bearer of the shield, the left for the viewer) part of the mantle has the head of a moor in her natural colour (brown) wearing a red crown and red collar; the left part of the mantle has a walking bear in its natural colour (brown) carrying a red pack tied with black bands.

Note 1. A mantle outside the shield does not normally contain ''charges'' (an heraldic term for objects). Within the shield, as here, it is a religious symbol, and indicates ideals inspired in monastic spirituality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is also a reference to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]].

Note 2. The black bands tying the red pack is one of several existing contraventions of the heraldic [[rule of tincture]], which in general does not allow the placing of colour on colour or metal (gold or silver) on another metal.

===Charges===
The charges of the arms &amp;mdash; the [[Maure|Moor's head]], [[Corbinian]]'s bear, and [[scallop]] &amp;mdash; appeared on Ratzinger's previous coat of arms, used when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. However, they relate not only to his origins, but also to his trust in God, as well his calling to spread this faith to others.

====Scallop shell====
The symbolism of the [[scallop]] shell is multiple. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] is said to have been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, "I am emptying the sea into this hole."  Thus did [[Augustine]] understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on ''The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church'', and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.

The scallop shell is also an allusion to the [[Sacrament]] of Holy [[Baptism]]. In the Roman Catholic Church, a sea shell is often used to pour water over the head of the child being baptized. Thus, a sea shell is used to evoke the imagery of this rite which is fundamental to the Christian life.

The shell also stands for [[pilgrimage]]. When topped with a [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shell]] a [[pilgrim's staff]], or "[[Jacob's staff]]", is the sign of a pilgrim. In Church art it is a symbol of the apostle [[Saint James the Great]], and his sanctuary at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain, perhaps the principal place of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. This symbol also alludes to "the pilgrim people of God", a title for the Church which Joseph Ratzinger championed at the [[Second Vatican Council]] as ''[[peritus]]'' (theological adviser) to Cardinals [[Josef Frings]] of Cologne and [[Julius Döpfner]] of Munich-Freising (his episcopal predecessor). When he became Archbishop he took the shell in his coat of arms. It is also found in the insignia of the Schottenkloster in Regensburg, where the major seminary of that diocese is located, a place where Benedict taught as a professor of theology.

Finally, the [[pilgrimage]] [[symbol]]ism of the shell may also refer both to the reconfigured role of the pope as not only ruler, but also pilgrim among the peoples and nations of the world. [[Pope Paul VI]]&amp;mdash;who created Joseph Ratzinger as a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1977&amp;mdash;was often called the "Pilgrim Pope" for his ground-breaking travels to the [[Holy Land]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Colombia]], the [[Philippines]], and elsewhere. This precedent was greatly elaborated upon by [[Pope John Paul II]] with his historic trips, numbering over a hundred. As a result, Benedict may be paying homage to these men and the new role for the papacy.

====Moor of Freising====
[[File:Hochstift Freising coat of arms.svg|right|150px|Moor's head of Freising, from the coat of arms of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Freising]].]]
The [[maure|Moor's head]] is a heraldic charge associated with [[Wörth, Upper Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. The origin of the Moor's head in Freising is not entirely known. Typically facing to the heraldic right, the viewer's left (''[[dexter and sinister|dexter]]'' in heraldic terms) and depicted in natural brown colour ''caput Aethiopum'' (literally "Ethiopian head") with red lips, crown and collar. This is the ancient emblem of the Diocese of Freising, founded in the 8th century, which became a [[Metropolitan Archdiocese]] with the name of München und Freising in 1818, subsequent to the [[Concordat]] between [[Pius VII]] and [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria]] (5 June 1817).

The Moor's head is fairly common in European heraldry. It still appears today in the arms of [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], as well as in the [[blazons]] of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band around his head instead of a crown, indicating a slave who has been freed; whereas in [[German heraldry]] the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the [[Bavaria]]n tradition and is known as the ''caput Ethiopicum'' or the ''Moor of Freising''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110021140/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |archivedate=2007-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corbinian's bear====
A legend states that while traveling to Rome, Saint [[Corbinian]]'s pack [[horse]] was killed by a [[bear]]. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned        to Bavaria. The implication is that "[[Christianity]] tamed and domesticated the ferocity of [[paganism]] and thus laid the foundations for a great civilization in the Duchy of [[Bavaria]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The bear and the scallop-shell &amp;mdash; a unique papal coat of arms | work=Catholic World News| url= http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=36801   | date =27 April 2005 | accessdate=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolizes the weight of office that Benedict carried.

==External ornaments==
[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|200px|The coat of arms of the Holy See.]]
[[File:Guardia Svizzera Bandiera.svg|thumb|right|200px|Banner of the Swiss Guard, with the coat-of-arms of Pope Benedict XVI modified to include the papal tiara.]]
Traditionally, a pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. No other objects nor a motto was added. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind on heaven and earth ({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}}). Pope Benedict's arms maintain the keys, but replace the tiara with a mitre and add a pallium. However, the tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy, and appear on the coat of arms of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
In Pope Benedict's arms, the tiara is replaced with a silver [[mitre]] with three gold stripes.&lt;ref name= "cns2005"&gt;{{cite news | last=Glatz | first=Carol  |  title=Pope drops papal crown from coat of arms, adds miter, pallium | date=2005-05-18 | publisher=Catholic News Service | url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502625.htm| accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stripes recall the three crowns of the tiara, which came to represent the three powers of the Bishop of Rome: Orders, Jurisdiction and Magisterium. The stripes preserve that meaning and are joined at the centre to show their unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Pallium===
The [[pallium]] with red crosses is also a new addition.&lt;ref name="cns2005"/&gt; It represents a bishop's role of being pastor of the flock entrusted to him by Christ. The form of the pallium included in the coat of arms recalls that used by metropolitan archbishops (but with black crosses) rather than the much larger pallium worn by Pope Benedict at his inauguration.

==Early controversy==
Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} have voiced objection to Pope Benedict's use of the mitre and pallium in his coat of arms, and the absence of the traditional [[papal tiara]].

Their arguments include:
* The use of mitres in the personal arms of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and [[bishop]]s was banned by an instruction of the Holy See in April 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church | title= Instruction on the Dress, Titles, and Coat-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops, and Lesser Prelates |url= http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm |publisher=Salvador Miranda via [[Florida International University|FIU]] | accessdate= 2012-03-23|date=April 17, 1969 | quote= 28. The use of coats-of-arms by Cardinals and Bishops is permitted. The shield of the coat-of-arms must be simple and clear. The use of the crozier and mitre in the coat-of-arms is suppressed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a crozier and mitre were used as external ornaments, being placed behind the shield, beneath the clerical hat, the [[galero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sahw.bravehost.com/c-ecc.htm Ecclesiastical Heraldry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000802/http://sahw.bravehost.com/c-ecc.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An example of an episcopal coat-of-arms ensigned with mitre and crozier, curiously granted a few months ''after'' the official exclusion of these ornaments, is [http://www.sonasmor.net/CD23.html that of Bishop Colin A. MacPherson of Argyll and the Isles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803150729/http://www.sonasmor.net/CD23.html |date=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rom - Vatikanische Gärten Papstwappen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pope's arms with a tiara, Vatican Garden]]
Regardless of the validity of such arguments, the Pope, as supreme legislator and interpreter of Church law,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6YCpraE-7xcC&amp;pg=PA71 John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, ''New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law''] (Paulist Press 2002 {{ISBN|9780809140664}}), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; had full authority to decide the form of his armorial bearings.

Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} claimed that Benedict's arms could still properly be rendered with the tiara and keys and without the pallium. This was done in the Vatican gardens behind [[St. Peter's Basilica]], viewable from atop the dome. Shortly after the death of John Paul II, the contents of his shield were removed from the flowerbed, but the tiara was left in place.  After the [[Papal conclave, 2005|election of Benedict XVI]], the gardeners put the design of the new Pope's arms within the shield, but rather than digging up the flowers depicting the tiara and replacing them with a mitre design, they left the tiara in place and omitted the pallium.

{{clear|left}}

==Later controversy==

In a 2013 interview, Cardinal [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]], designer of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426013511/http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |archivedate=26 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges riksvapen}}) has a lesser and a greater version.

== Regulated usage ==
The usage of the coats of arms is regulated by Swedish Law, [[Swedish Code of Statutes|Act]] [http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19700498.HTM 1970:498], which states (in unofficial translation) that "in commercial activities, the coats of arms, the flag or other official insignia of Sweden may not be used in a trademark or other insignias for products or services without proper authorisation. This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered."

Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.

==Variants==
The arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/rikskal/1909/0002.html|title=i (Svensk rikskalender / 1909)|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also formally codifies the differences between the "greater" and "lesser" arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.

===Greater version===
The greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A shield [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], quartered by a cross [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] with outbent arms, and an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three [[Crown (heraldry)|open crowns]] Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams [[argent]], a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] crowned with an open crown Or armed [[gules]]. The inescutcheon is [[Division of the field|party per pale]] the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a ''vasa'' Or); and the [[House of Bernadotte]] (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. [[Supporters|Supported]] by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] Or. All surrounded by [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] mantling, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseladorned strings Or.''&lt;ref&gt;Original text of Swedish statute 1982:268, 2 §, states: ''Stora riksvapnet utgörs av en blå huvudsköld, kvadrerad genom ett kors av guld med utböjda armar, samt en hjärtsköld som innehåller det kungliga husets dynastivapen. Huvudsköldens första och fjärde fält innehåller tre öppna kronor av guld, ordnade två över en. Huvudsköldens andra och tredje fält innehåller tre ginbalksvis gående strömmar av silver, överlagda med ett upprest, med öppen krona krönt lejon av guld med röd tunga samt röda tänder och klor. Hjärtskölden är kluven. Första fältet innehåller Vasaättens vapen: ett i blått, silver och rött styckat fält, belagt med en vase av guld. Andra fältet innehåller ätten Bernadottes vapen: i blått fält en ur vatten uppskjutande bro med tre valv och två krenelerade torn, allt av silver, däröver en örn av guld med vänstervänt huvud och sänkta vingar gripande om en åskvigg av guld samt överst Karlavagnens stjärnbild av guld. Huvudskölden är krönt med en kunglig krona och omges av Serafimer ordens insignier. Sköldhållare är två tillbakaseende, med kunglig krona krönta lejon med kluvna svansar samt röda tungor, tänder och klor. Lejonen står på ett postament av guld. Det hela omges av en med kunglig krona krönt hermelinsfodrad vapenmantel av purpur med frans av guld och uppknuten med tofsprydda snören av guld. Stora riksvapnet får brukas även utan ordensinsignier, sköldhållare, postament eller vapenmantel.''

The greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson]] in 1448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berghman |first=Arvid |title=Dynastien Bernadottes vapen och det svenska riksvapnet |series=Skrifter / utgivna av Riksheraldikerämbetet, 99-2298099-1 ; 1 |year=1944 |publisher=Svensk litteratur |location=Stockholm |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; chosen as a symbol of Sweden's eternal existence, as in the poem by [[Esaias Tegnér]]:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;As long as [[Charles's Wain]] still turns,
Its golden wheels around the Northern zone,
As long as the land still produces iron and heroes,
Intact shall stand the ancient Swedish throne.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. [[Ursa Major]], or as it is called in Swedish, ''Karlavagnen'' (Charles' Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/early_history_of_heraldry/the_three_crowns_of_sweden.htm|title=The Heraldry Society|website=Theheraldrysociety.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Personal command-sign of the King of Sweden.svg|thumb|left|The personal command sign, for military use, of the King is a rendition of the emblazonment of the greater arms. Introduced by royal regulation in 1943, it has only been created once.]]

The arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (''queue fourchée''), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the [[Order of Seraphim]], the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 2 and 3, Lag No. 268 om Sveriges Riksvapen of April 29, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the [[House of Bernadotte|Royal House]], with the alterations and additions decided by him.

[[Blazon]]: "The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an [[inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.

In the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] and the [[House of Bernadotte]]. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or."

===Lesser version===
The lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the [[Government of Sweden]] and subordinate government authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all [[Swedish police]] uniforms and in various coats of arms of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Blazon: "Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one." Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]."

The family of '''Dezallier d'Argenville''' produced two writers and connoisseurs in the course of the 18th century.

[[File:Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville.jpg|thumb|Dezallier d'Argenville.]]  
[[File:Dézallier d’Argenville Vanghelisty.jpg|thumb|Dezallier d'Argenville.]]  

==Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville==
'''Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville''' (Paris, 1 July 1680 – 29 November 1765), avocat to the [[Parlement de Paris]] and secretary to the king, was a connoisseur of gardening who laid out two for himself and his family, before writing ''La théorie et la pratique du jardinage'' (published anonymously, 1709; second edition, 1713), based on his experience and his reading.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: '' La theorie et la pratique du jardinage. Ou l'on traite à fond des beaux jardins appellés communément les jardins de propreté, comme sont les parterres, les bosquets, les boulingrins, &amp;c. Contenant plusieurs plans et dispositions generales de jardins; nouveaux desseins…&amp; autres ornemens servant à la décoration &amp; embélissement des jardins. Avec la manière de dresser un terrain…'' His remark "A fine garden being no less difficult to contrive and order well than a good building" suggests that he had read [[Francis Bacon]]'s essay "Of gardening".&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the illustrations were by [[Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond]], who was credited as the author in the third edition, 1722.&lt;ref&gt;Gerda Gollwitzer, "The influence of Le Nostre" in ''The French Formal Garden'', 1974, Elizabeth B. MacDougall and F. Hamilton Hazlehurst, editors (Dumbarton Oaks)&lt;/ref&gt; As the work of a gentleman rather than a gardener, as previous French books on gardening had all been, Dezallier d'Argenville's work was laid out like a treatise of architecture, addressed as much to the architect and the patron as to the practising gardener. As its title suggests, the treatise is composed of two parts: the theoretical principles of the art of fine gardening and its practical applications. The first section considers the principles of siting the ''maison de plaisance'' relative to its gardens, techniques of laying out geometric figures in parterres, [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] and formal tree plantations (''[[bosquet]]s''), and the planning of garden [[pavilion]]s and the siting of sculpture, an essential element in the ''jardin français''.  The second part applies the principles in earth works, terraces and stairs, and the [[hydraulics]] necessary for constructing ''[[jeux d'eau]]'': fountains, cascades, pools (''bassins'') and canals.

His rational principles could adapt formal [[parterre]] gardening to the simplified programs available to the upper middle class,&lt;ref&gt;Previous books on gardening had presented only the grandest royal and aristocratic projects.&lt;/ref&gt; which accounts for the immense popularity of his book, which is the central document in the 18th century formal garden in the wake of [[André Le Nôtre]]. The work went through thirteen editions in France,&lt;ref&gt;And unauthorized reprints from The Hague&lt;/ref&gt; where the English mode of landscape design scarcely made itself known before the French Revolution. It was published in a German version (1731)&lt;ref&gt;''Die Gärtnerey sowohl in ihre Theorie oder Betrachtung, als Praxi oder Übung'', translated by Frantz Anton Danreitter, gardener to the [[archbishop of Salzburg]] (Gollwitzer, p. 74).&lt;/ref&gt; and translated into English by the architect [[John James (architect)|John James]], as ''The Theory and Practice of Gardening'' (1712, with a 2nd edition in 1728, and a 3rd edition in 1743, when the [[English landscape garden]], might have seemed to make its formal designs passé.) Dezallier d'Argenville's ''Théorique'' in its English version introduced the [[Ha-ha]], the invisible fence, to English practice.

==Dezailler d'Argenville==
Dezailler d'Argenville was called upon to edit or contribute more than 600 entries in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], published in parts from 1751.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1989_num_7_1_1036 |first=Frank A. |last=Kafker: |chapter=Notices sur les auteurs des dix-sept volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie |title=Recherches sur Diderot et sur l’Encyclopédie  Année |date=1989  |volume=7 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dezallier d'Argenville's interest in [[natural history]] resulted in two treatises, on shells and minerals, ''L'histoire naturelle éclaircie dans deux de ses parties principales, la lithologie et la conchyliologie''. (Paris 1742) ''La Conchyliologie, ou Traité sur la nature des coquillages'' 1757 etc.. The connoisseurship of shells and their most colourful and fantastic form was a gentleman's occupation and a worthy inclusion in a ''cabinet de curiosités'' before it became a science under the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system]] of classification.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London in March 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27argenville%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond his success in the fields of gardening and natural history, Dezallier d'Argenville was a print collector. He organised his extensive collection by subject rather than by school, as outlined in the 'Lettre sur le choix et l'arrangement d'un Cabinet curieux…' that he published in the ''Mercure de France'' in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;'Lettre sur le choix et l'arrangement d'un Cabinet curieux, écrite par M. Dezallier d'Argenville, Secretaire (sic) du Roy en la Grande Chancellerie, à M. Fougeroux, Tresorier-Paeur des Rentes de l'Hôte, de Ville', "Mercure de France", June 1727, pp. 1294–1330.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the 'Lettre', which takes the form of an article, Dezallier d'Argenville describes 'Three volumes containing the clothing and fashion of the different nations of the world', and a further volume documenting costumes from his native France. The sale of Dezallier's property, which took place on 3 March 1766 following his death in 1765, mentions within these volumes a total of 1,600 costume prints from the time of King Charles II until 1730. It also describes 'good prints by le Clerc, Picart, Hollar, Royn de Hoog and several Chinese drawings.'&lt;ref&gt;P.

Dezalier d'Argenville maître des comptes, &amp; membre des sociétés royales des sciences de Londres &amp; Monpellier, Paris, 3 March 1766, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; All four volumes are now located at the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;D.

His son, '''Antoine-Nicolas Dezallier d'Argenville''' (1723–1796), was the anonymous author ''(M. D***.)'' of ''Voyage Pictoresque de Paris; ou Indication de tout ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans cette grande Ville en Peinture, Sculpture, &amp; Architecture'', which appeared in Paris in 1749, a connoisseur's guide to the chief artistic and architectural monuments of Paris, with accounts of the leading academic and scientific organisations of the city. At least six further editions appeared before the Revolution (Paris, 1752, 1757, 1765, 1770, 1778, 1780). A ''Voyage pittoresque des environs de Paris, ou Description des Maisons Royales, Châteaux &amp; autres Lieux de Plaisance, situés à quinze lieues aux environs de cette Ville '' by the same author appeared in Paris in 1755, a connoiseur's guide to the chief artistic and architectural monuments of the surroundings of Paris in which the author especially paid a tribute to the triumphe of gardening. At least one further edition appeared before the Revolution (Paris, 1768, 3rd edition).

Further works were ''Dénombrement de tous les fossiles de France'' and ''L'Oryctologie ou Traité des pierres, des minéraux et autres fossiles''.

He compiled also the ''Vies des Fameux Architectes Depuis la renaissance des Arts'' in two volumes, 1787, of which the second was devoted to sculptors. An abridged edition (''Abrégé de la vie...'') was often reprinted. A facsimile was published in Geneva 1972. He also wrote a ''Dictionnaire du jardinage, relatif à la théorie. et à la pratique de cet art'' (Paris, 1771) and a ''Manuel du jardinier ou journal de son travail distribué par mois,'' (Paris, 1772)  &lt;!--not this Dezallier d'Argenville:and contributed to the Encyclopédie by Diderot and d'Alembert.--&gt;

The council of '''Eight Men''' was an early representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous [[Twelve Men]] and was followed by the [[Nine Men]].

==Council==
In 1643 [[Abraham Pietersen Van Deusen]] who had served on the [[council of twelve men]] was appointed to a new council of eight men. The council contacted the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] and blamed governor [[Willem Kieft]] for the declining economic condition of the nascent colony, and the [[Kieft's War|war]] with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. They requested that a new [[Director-General of New Netherland]] be appointed and that the people themselves be given more influence in the new government. Director General Kieft was dismissed, and [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took his place and Stuyvesant remained in power until the colony was turned over to the British in 1664. Kieft returned to Holland, but the vessel, the [[Princess Amelia (1634 ship)|''Princess Amelia'']] was lost at sea and his body was never recovered. John Franklin Jameson (1859–1937) writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonalty were called together; they were sore distressed. They chose eight, in the stead of the previous twelve, persons to aid in consulting for the best; but the occupation every one had to take care of his own, prevented anything beneficial being adopted at that time. nevertheless it was resolved that as many Englishmen as were to be got in the country should be enlisted, who were indeed now proposing to depart; the third part of these were to be paid by the commonalty; this promise was made by the commonalty but was not followed by the pay.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Council Members==
The council members were:&lt;ref&gt;New York State; O'Callaghan, EB; Broadhead, John Romeyn: ''Documents relative to the colonial history of the state of New York, Vol. I'', p. 191, 1856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=oC0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=council+twelve+kieft+brodhead&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPA191,M1 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/projects/New-Amsterdam-Notable-Citizens&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1643 a minor altercation with Indians evolved into a serious uprising followed by an ugly slaughter of Weckquaskeek Indians on Manhattan Island. Kieft feared a major Indian assault. Allerton was asked by Kieft to join a "group of 8 men" to help New Amsterdam. Because he was English and respected in New Haven, Kieft sent Allerton and another Englishman to New Haven in 1643 to ask for men and materials to help defend New Amsterdam. In addition, the "group of 8" was asked to propose measures to improve civility and law-and-order in New Amsterdam. New Haven refused to send men to support the Dutch but Kieft entered into an agreement with the Indians in 1645 that settled the dispute. Because of Kieft's dictatorial manner, several of the eight men petitioned the WIC directors to recall Kieft as Director-General. In time Kieft was replaced by Peter Stuyvesant, and the men initiating the recall petition were accused of insurrection and faced punishment. Allerton was the second signatory of the petition but was not the group's primary spokesman. In 1646, Allerton established a permanent residence in New Haven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Facebook real-name policy controversy''' refers to the controversy over [[Social networking service|social networking]] site [[Facebook]]{{'}}s "[[real-name system]]" dictating how people register their accounts and configure their [[user profile]]s.  The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be "fake", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have "too many words", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.

== Background ==
The social networking website [[Facebook]] has maintained the [[real-name system]] policy for user profiles.  According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/facebook-name-policy/ |title=Facebook 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity |last=Grinberg |first=Emanuella |date=September 18, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576|title=What names are allowed on Facebook?|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise per this policy, a "real name" is defined by "your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apologizes-for-real-name-policy-2014-10|title=Facebook Apologizes For 'Real Name' Policy That Forced Drag Queens To Change Their Profiles|last=Levy|first=Karyne|date=October 1, 2014|work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83&amp;nbsp;million Facebook accounts are fake accounts.&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook: About 83 million accounts are fake |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-08-03/cnbc-facebook-fake-accounts/56759964/1 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook share price slumps below $20 amid fake account flap |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-share-price-slumps-20-dollars |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has asserted that "authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person."&lt;ref name="usa" /&gt;

==Affected users==

===Ethnic groups===

====Native Americans====
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still suspending Native Americans over 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/16/facebook-real-name-policy-suspends-native-americans|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Robin Kills The Enemy, a resident of the [[Sioux]] Rosebud reservation in South Dakota, found that when she tried to register her surname in its normal format, the site would not let her use them, so she resorted to combining the three words, spelling them as one word.  After having been a member for some time, she eventually contacted the site in an attempt to have her surname spelled as it actually is in real life.  However, after reaching out to Facebook, they instead deactivated her account without explanation.  When she was finally able to make contact with an actual employee, they wrote back telling her "Fake names are a violation of our Terms of Use. Facebook requires users to provide their full first and last names".  She eventually managed to have her account reinstated; however, users with the surname Kills The Enemy are, as of 2015, still required by Facebook to spell their surname without spaces as a single word.&lt;ref name=ictmn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Nestor|title=Facebook no friend to American Indian names |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/02/16/facebook-no-friend-american-indian-names-82895|website=Indian Country Today media network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shane Creepingbear, an Oklahoman member of the [[Kiowa]] tribe, reported that he had been "kicked off" of Facebook on [[Columbus Day]] for having a supposedly fake name.&lt;ref name=metroCreepingbear&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAteer|first1=Ollie|title=Native Americans booted off Facebook for having ‘fake’ names like Creepingbear|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/11/native-americans-booted-off-facebook-for-having-fake-names-like-creepingbear-5057955/|website=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lance Brown Eyes, an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]], found that his account had been suspended; when he was able to send in documentation to Facebook proving his identity, Facebook reinstated his account, but changed his name to "Lance Brown".&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russon|first1=Mary-Ann|title=Facebook fail: Native Americans keep being accused of using fake names|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/facebook-fail-native-americans-keep-being-accused-using-fake-names-1487378|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dana Lone Hill, a member of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe who had been a registered Facebook user for several years, discovered one day that she had been locked out of her account.  A message from Facebook said "it looks like the name on your Facebook account may not be your authentic name".  After a week, during which she had to send in her personal documentation to Facebook, her account access was restored.  She has since threatened a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Native Americans against Facebook due to how it exercises its name policies.

A number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillip| first1=Abby| title=Online ‘authenticity’ and how Facebook's ‘real name’ policy hurts Native Americans | date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2015|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/10/online-authenticity-and-how-facebooks-real-name-policy-hurts-native-americans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a [[class action lawsuit]] against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Native American activist to sue Facebook over site's 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/19/native-american-activist-facebook-lawsuit-real-name|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese====
In 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her [[Yoda_(disambiguation)|surname]], which is common in Japan, being confused with a [[Star Wars]] character of the [[Yoda|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2632170/Woman-called-Yoda-blocked-from-Facebook.html|title=Woman called Yoda blocked from Facebook|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=27 August 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish====
The [[Dublin]] branch of the [[Irish language]] rights group, Misneach, started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/protest-at-dublin-facebook-hq-over-real-name-policy-1.2345414 |title=Protest at Dublin Facebook HQ over ‘real-name’ policy |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 9, 2015 |work=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Gaelic====
In 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wins Facebook battle over ‘fake’ Gaelic name|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/man-wins-facebook-battle-over-fake-gaelic-name-1-3702815|date=26 February 2015|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chamoru====
In the Spanish-influenced indigenous [[Chamoru]] culture of the [[Marianas]], the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's [[maiden name]] as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that "Names can't have too many words." Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.

In cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that "Profile names can't have too many periods.") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being "Mary Dlg Mafnas". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.

====Vietnamese====
In January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being "false and misleading".&lt;ref name=BBCBich&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34897404|title=Phuc Dat Bich: Australian with 'misleading' name thanks supporters|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to "Phoo Da Bi" (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Vietnamese|{{ipa|/fukp˦˥ ɗat˩ ɓic˦˥/}}]]).&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was "glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous".&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; Subsequently "Phuc Dat" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phuc Dat Bich admits hoax in Facebook name battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-34918491|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tamils====
Tamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bumpahead.net/tamil-name-structure-10dd63730563|title=Tamil name structure… |author=moulee|date=19 July 2009|publisher=bumpahead.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/facebook-should-scrap-its-regressive-real-names-policy/article7797302.ece|title=Really harassed by Facebook’s ‘real names’|author=G. Sampath|date=24 October 2015|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender users===
Facebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or [[pseudonym]]s used by the [[transgender]] community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-05-25/business/20872135_1_accounts-with-fake-names-facebook-facebook-guidelines-and-features|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Barbara|last=Ortutay|date=May 25, 2009|title=Real users caught in Facebook fake-name purge|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user via the anonymous [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app [[Secret (app)|Secret]] began reporting "fake names" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the [[stage name]]s of [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still freezing accounts despite apology to drag queens over 'real names.'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/facebook-still-freezing-accounts-despite-apology-drag-queens-real-names|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03|title=My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not use on the site|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|author=Zip|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/28/woman-responsible-for-facebook-gender-options-kicked-off-for-violating-real-names-policy/|title=Woman responsible for Facebook gender options kicked off for violating real names policy|date=June 28, 2015|first=Naith|last=Payton|publisher=[[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.{{Better source|date=March 2015|reason=Daily Dot.  This is an opinion piece.  Author admits the article is about his/her personal experience, and it may or may not be completely factual or verifiable}}&lt;ref name="Daily Dot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dragonetti| first1=D.| title=Is Facebook easing up on its 'real names' policy—or cracking down? | work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=October 20, 2014|accessdate=October 23, 2014|url= http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/facebook-real-names-cracking-down-transgender/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2014, [[Chris Cox (Facebook)|Chris Cox]], Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.&lt;ref name="chriscoxpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.cox/posts/10101301777354543|title=Chris Cox - I want to apologize to the affected community of drag...|last=Cox|first=Chris|date=October 1, 2014|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Users target of religious persecution ===
Secular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger [[Raif Badawi]] in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/abdullah-sharif/pakistans-religious-extremism_b_9577338.html|title=Pakistan's Religious Extremism: A World Menace|first=Abdullah|last=Sharif|date=1 April 2016|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
International non-profit [[digital rights]] group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stated they were "alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community |title=Facebook's 'Real Name' Policy Can Cause Real-World Harm for the LGBTQ Community |last1=Kayyali |last2=York |first1=Nadia |first2=Jillian |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online magazine]] ''[[Queerty]]'' called Facebook's policy "a frankly creepy overreach of authority", adding "There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place."&lt;ref name="Queerty"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.queerty.com/facebook-targeting-drag-queens-forcing-them-to-use-their-legal-names-20140911 |title=Facebook Targeting Drag Queens, Forcing Them To Use Their Legal Names |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 11, 2014 |work=[[Queerty]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: "If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone…  FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://0zymandius.wix.com/magemagazine#!September-18-The-Day-F-Book-killed-the-King-Part-1/c112t/55fc2bae0cf256c0bf936f60|title=The Day F Book killed the King : Part 1|date=September 18, 2015|first=Ian|last=Thomson|magazine=MAGE Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seattle]] [[Drag (clothing)|drag performer]] Olivia LaGarce started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] titled "Allow performers to use their stage names on their Facebook accounts!"&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Stranger"/&gt;

== Compromise to protect those with special circumstances  ==
On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/|title=Community Support FYI: Improving the Names Process on Facebook |last1=Osofsky |first1=Jason |last2=Gage |first2=Todd |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Facebook Newsroom |publisher=Facebook |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/facebook-modifies-real-names-policy-testing-use-of-assumed-names-1.2702400 |title=Facebook modifies 'real names' policy, testing use of assumed names |last=AFP |date=December 16, 2015 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their "special circumstance" or "unique situation" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/15/facebook-change-controversial-real-name-policy?subid=17310058&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2 |title=Facebook changes controversial 'real name' policy in wake of criticism  |last1=Holpuch |first1=Amanda |date=December 15, 2015 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/changes-facebooks-real-names-policy-still-dont-fix-problem|title=Changes to Facebook’s "Real Names" Policy Still Don’t Fix the Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790?helpref=related|title=What other names are allowed on Facebook?|publisher=Facebook|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fathers of the Constitution''' ({{lang-es|Padres de la Constitución|links=no}}) were the seven political leaders who participated in the writing of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. 

[[Gabriel Cisneros]], [[Miguel Herrero y Rodríguez de Miñón]] and [[José Pedro Pérez Llorca]]
represented the centre-right [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]]; [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne]], the right-wing [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance]]; [[Gregorio Peces-Barba]], the left-wing [[Spanish Socialist Worker's Party]]; [[Jordi Solé Tura]], the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] and [[Miguel Roca Junyent]], of the [[Democratic Pact for Catalonia]], represented the [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/padres/Constitucion/1978/elpporesp/20031016elpepunac_11/Tes|title=Los padres de la Constitución de 1978|trans-title=The fathers of the 1978 constitution|work=[[El País]]|date=2003-10-16|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flag (Standard) of the President of Belarus''' ({{Lang-be|Штандар Прэзідэнта Рэспублікі Беларусь}}) is the official symbol of the [[President of Belarus]]. It is used at buildings and on vehicles to denote the presence of the President.

The presidential standard, which has been in use since 1997, was adopted by a decree called "Concerning the Standard of the President of Republic of Belarus".

== Design ==
The standard's design is an exact copy of the national flag, with the addition of the [[National emblem of Belarus|Belarusian national emblem]] in gold and red. The standard's ratio of 5:6 differs from that of the national flag, making the standard almost square. The Presidential Flag is framed with golden fringes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://old.bankzakonov.com/obsch/razdel192/time6/lavz5977.htm Decree dated March 27, 1997, creating the presidential standard]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The original version of the Presidential Standard is kept in the office of the President at the [[Independence Palace, Minsk|Independence Palace]]. The duplicates of Presidential Flag can be placed in the halls or rooms of the Independence Palace or Presidential residences if any official event is intended to be conducted in the presence of the President;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.belta.by/president/view/belarus-president-meets-with-supreme-court-chairman-111494-2018/ Belarus President meets with Supreme Court chairman]&lt;/ref&gt; on other premises when the President of Belarus is visiting; in the hall of the building, where official or other types of events are being held with the participation of the President of Belarus; and on the vehicles of the President.

Presidential flag is also used during inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.gov.by/en/news_en/view/belarus-presidents-inauguration-ceremony-on-6-november-12501/ Belarus President’s inauguration ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaitelgrima''' is a [[Lombards|Lombard]] feminine name. There are several notable Gaitelgrimas in history.  The identities of these five women (as well as some others of the same name) are often confused because they were all closely related to each other and to two men: [[Guaimar III of Salerno]] and his son, [[Guaimar IV of Salerno|Guaimar IV]]; they were the princes of Salerno from about 983 to 1027 and from 1027 to 1052.

The first was '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''', daughter of [[Atenulf I of Capua]], married [[Guaimar II of Salerno]] and was the mother of [[Gisulf I of Salerno]]. 

The second, also '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''' or '''Gaitelgrima of Benevento''' (died after 1027), was the daughter of [[Pandulf II of Benevento]] and sister of [[Pandulf IV of Capua]].  She was the second wife of Guaimar III and mother of Guaimar IV (his successor), [[Guy, Duke of Sorrento|Guy]] (later duke of [[Sorrento]]), and [[Pandulf of Capaccio|Pandulf]] (later lord of [[Capaccio]]).  She was also the mother of the third Gaitelgrima.  

This third was '''Gaitelgrima of Salerno''', also known as '''Altrude''', who married successively two brothers, [[Drogo of Hauteville]] and [[Humphrey of Hauteville]], who were [[counts of Apulia]].  Through the latter, she was mother to [[Abelard of Hauteville|Abelard]] and [[Herman of Hauteville|Herman]].  

The fourth, also named after Gaitelgrima of Benevento, was also a '''[[Gaitelgrima, daughter of Guaimar IV|Gaitelgrima of Salerno]]'''.  She was the daughter of Guaimar IV of Salerno (see above) and Gemma.  She was married off by her brother [[Gisulf II of Salerno]] to [[Jordan I of Capua]] as was her sister, [[Sichelgaita]], to [[Robert Guiscard]]. 

The last was '''Gaitelgrima, [[Duke of Apulia|Duchess of Apulia]]''', the second wife of [[William II, Duke of Apulia]].  She was the daughter of [[Jordan II of Capua]]. She deeply loved her husband and cut off her hair to cover his coffin at his funeral.

'''''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik''''' ('''GR''') is the informal name of a comprehensive [[table of integrals]] originally compiled by the Russian mathematicians I. S. Gradshteyn and I. M. Ryzhik. Its full title today is '''''Table of Integrals, Series, and Products'''''.

Since its first publication in 1943, it was considerably expanded and it soon became a "classic" and highly regarded reference for mathematicians, scientists and engineers. After the deaths of the original authors, the work was maintained and further expanded by other editors.

At some stage a German and English dual-language translation became available, followed by Polish, English-only and Japanese versions. After several further editions, the Russian and German-English versions went out of print and have not been updated after [[the fall of the Iron Curtain]], but the English version is still being actively maintained and refined by new editors, and it has recently been retranslated back into Russian as well.

==Overview==
One of the valuable characteristics of ''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik'' compared to similar compilations is that most listed integrals are referenced. The literature list contains 92 main entries and 140 additional entries (in the eighth English edition). The integrals are classified by numbers, which haven't changed from the fourth Russian up to the seventh English edition (the numbering in older editions as well as in the eighth English edition is not fully compatible).
The book does not only contain the integrals, but also lists additional properties and related [[special function]]s.
It also includes tables for [[integral transform]]s.
Another advantage of ''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik'' compared to [[computer algebra system]]s is the fact that all special functions and constants used in the evaluation of the integrals are listed in a registry as well, thereby allowing reverse lookup of integrals based on special functions or constants.

On the downsides, ''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik'' has become known to contain a relatively high number of typographical errors even in newer editions, which has repeatedly led to the publication of extensive [[errata]] lists. Earlier English editions were also criticized for their poor translation of mathematical terms&lt;ref name="RMT_85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REV_153_5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REV_209_1"/&gt; and mediocre print quality.&lt;ref name="RMT_85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REV_153_5"/&gt;

In the foreword of the first edition by Ryzhik, the author thanked three mathematicians of the [[Moscow Mathematical Society]] for their suggestions and advice: 
[[Vyacheslav Vassilievich Stepanov]] ({{lang|ru|[[Вячеслав Васильевич Степанов]]}}), {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexei Ivanovich Markushevich|de|3=Alexei Iwanowitsch Markuschewitsch|lt=Alexei Ivanovich Markushevich}} ({{lang|ru|Алексей Иванович Маркушевич}}), and [[Ilya Nikolaevich Bronshtein]] ({{lang|ru|[[Илья Николаевич Бронштейн]]}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The third edition (1951) was worked on by Gradshteyn, who also introduced the chapter numbering system in [[decimal notation]].

In 1963, it was followed by the second edition, a reprint edition with a four-page inlet listing corrections compiled by [[Eldon Robert Hansen]].

Derived from the 1963 edition, but considerably expanded, the third German-English edition by {{lang|de|Ludwig Boll}}&lt;ref group="nb" name="Boll_Bio"&gt;Ludwig Boll (1906–? or 1951?–1987), {{GND|116236140|1068090308}}?&lt;/ref&gt; was finally published in 1981; it incorporated the material of the fifth Russian edition (1971) as well.

Pending this third German-English edition an English-only edition by Alan Jeffrey&lt;ref group="nb" name="Jeffrey_Bio"&gt;Alan Jeffrey (1929-07-16 to 2010-06-06), {{GND|113118120}}. [http://www.ams.org/notices/201008/rtx100801006p.pdf] [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00036811.2012.648369] [http://www.librarything.com/author/jeffreyalan]&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1965. Lacking a clear designation by itself it was variously known as first, third&lt;!-- as it followed the 2nd German-English edition and because this edition number fits in nicely after the publication of the (actually so called) fifth English edition in 1994 --&gt; or fourth English edition, as it was based on the then-current fourth Russian edition. The formulas were photographically reproduced and the text translated. This still held true for the expanded fourth English edition in 1980, which added chapters 10 to 17.&lt;ref name="ZBL_521-193-1"/&gt;

Both of these editions saw multiple [[print run]]s each incorporating newly found corrections. Starting with the third printing&lt;!-- 1967 or 1969? --&gt;, updated table entries were marked by adding a small superscript number to the entry number indicating the corresponding print run ("3" etc.&lt;!-- print run "7" of 4th edition is documented for 1990 --&gt;), a convention carried over into later editions by continuing to increase the superscript number as kind of a [[revision number]] (no longer directly corresponding with actual print runs).

The fifth edition (1994), which contained close to 20&amp;thinsp;000 formulas,&lt;ref name="ZBL_918-65002"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="Formula_Entry"/&gt; was electronically reset&lt;ref name="REV_209_1"/&gt; in preparation for a CD-ROM issue of the fifth edition (1996) and in anticipation of further editions. Since the sixth edition (2000), now corresponding with superscript number "10", Daniel Zwillinger&lt;ref group="nb" name="Zwillinger_Bio"&gt;Daniel Zwillinger (1957–), {{GND|172475694}}.&lt;/ref&gt; started contributing as well. The last edition being edited by Jeffrey before his death&lt;ref group="nb" name="Jeffrey_Bio"/&gt; was the seventh English edition published in 2007 (with superscript number "11").&lt;ref name="Jeffrey_2007"&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Izrail Solomonovich |author-last1=Gradshteyn |author-link1=Izrail Solomonovich Gradshteyn |author-first2=Iosif Moiseevich |author-last2=Ryzhik |author-link2=Iosif Moiseevich Ryzhik |author-first3=Yuri Veniaminovich |author-last3=Geronimus |author-link3=Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus |author-first4=Michail Yulyevich |author-last4=Tseytlin |author-link4=Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin |editor-first1=Alan |editor-last1=Jeffrey |editor-first2=Daniel |editor-last2=Zwillinger |translator=((Scripta Technica, Inc.)) |title=Table of Integrals, Series, and Products |publisher=[[Academic Press, Inc.]] |date=February 2007 |edition=7 |isbn=978-0-12-373637-6 |id=GR:11 |mr=2360010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBgFYxKHUjsC |accessdate=2016-02-21}} [http://fisica.ciens.ucv.ve/~svincenz/TISPISGIMR.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This edition has been retranslated back into Russian as "seventh Russian edition" in 2011.&lt;ref name="APRU_2011"&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ru:Таблицы интегралов, ряда и продуктов |trans-title=Table of Integrals, Series, and Products |language=Russian |date=2011 |edition=7 |isbn=978-5-9775-0360-0 |publisher=[[:de:bhv (Verlag)|BHV]] (БХВ-Петербург) |url=http://www.apmath.spbu.ru/ru/staff/maximov/publ/publ1.pdf |accessdate=2016-03-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316120542/http://www.apmath.spbu.ru/ru/staff/maximov/publ/publ1.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Joan of Arc]] is considered a medieval Christian heroine of France for her role in the [[Hundred Years' War]], and was canonized as a [[Roman Catholic saint]]]]
[[File:Perseo in Villa San Marco Stabiae.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Perseus and the head of Medusa in a Roman fresco at [[Stabiae]]. Unlike medieval and modern heroes, classical heroes did great deeds out of esteem and fame rather than out of any concern for the good of people]]

A '''hero''' (masculine) or '''heroine''' (feminine) is a real person or a main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of [[ingenuity]], [[bravery]] or [[Physical strength|strength]]; the original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. On the other hand are [[Medieval]] and [[modern history|modern]] heroes, who perform great deeds for the common good instead of the classical goal of pride and fame.

The concept of the hero can be found in [[classical literature]]. It is the main or revered character in [[Epic poetry|heroic epic poetry]] celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|url = http://academic.eb.com/EBchecked/topic/263398/hero|website = academic.eb.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam Webster]] dictionary defines a hero as "a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hero|title=Definition of HERO|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as [[Gilgamesh]], [[Achilles]] and [[Iphigenia]], to historical figures, such as [[Joan of Arc]] or [[Sophie Scholl]], modern heroes like [[Alvin York]], [[Audie Murphy]] and [[Chuck Yeager]], and fictional [[superheroes]], including [[Superman]] and [[Batman]].

==Etymology==
The word ''hero'' comes from the Greek ἥρως (''hērōs''), "hero" (literally "protector" or "defender"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hero|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly one such as [[Heracles]] with divine ancestry or later given divine honors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dh%28%2Frws ἥρως]
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; Before the decipherment of [[Linear B]] the original form of the word was assumed to be *{{lang|grc|ἥρωϝ-}}, ''hērōw-'', but the Mycenaean compound ''ti-ri-se-ro-e'' demonstrates the absence of -w-.

According to the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root is ''*ser'' meaning "to protect". According to Eric Partridge in ''Origins,'' the Greek word  ''Hērōs'' "is akin to" the Latin ''seruāre,'' meaning ''to safeguard''. Partridge concludes, "The basic sense of both [[Hera]] and hero would therefore be 'protector'." [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejects an Indo-European derivation and asserts that the word has a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
{{see also|Greek hero cult}}
A classical hero is considered to be a "warrior who lives and dies in the pursuit of honor" and asserts their greatness by "the brilliancy and efficiency with which they kill".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each classical hero's life focuses on fighting, which occurs in war or during an epic quest. Classical heroes are commonly semi-divine and extraordinarily gifted, like [[Achilles]], evolving into heroic characters through their perilous circumstances.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; While these heroes are incredibly resourceful and skilled, they are often foolhardy, court disaster, risk their followers' lives for trivial matters, and behave arrogantly in a childlike manner.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; During classical times, people regarded heroes with the highest esteem and utmost importance, explaining their prominence within epic literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = Saul | year = 1984 | title = Love and the Hero of the Iliad | url = | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 43–50 | doi=10.2307/283510| jstor = 283510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of these mortal figures marks a revolution of audiences and writers turning away from [[Twelve Olympians|immortal gods]] to mortal mankind, whose heroic moments of glory survive in the memory of their descendants, extending their legacy.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

[[Hector]] was a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the [[Trojan War]], which is known primarily through [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Iliad]]''. Hector acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, "killing 31,000 Greek fighters," offers Hyginus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Hector was known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. However, his familial values conflict greatly with his heroic aspirations in ''The Iliad,'' as he cannot be both the protector of [[Troy]] and a father to his child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hector is ultimately betrayed by the gods when [[Athena]] appears disguised as his ally [[Deiphobus]] and convinces him to take on Achilles, leading to his death at the hands of a superior warrior.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad.'' Trans. Robert Fagles (1990). NY: Penguin Books. Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The_Rage_of_Achilles,_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo_(1696-1770),_Italian_Rococo_painter.jpg|thumb|An 18th century depiction of ''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]|302x302px]][[Achilles]] was a Greek Hero who was considered the most formidable military fighter in the entire Trojan War and the central character of ''The Iliad.'' He was the child of [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], making him a [[Demigod|demi-god]]. He wielded superhuman strength on the battlefield and was blessed with a close relationship to the [[Greek gods|Gods]]. Achilles famously refuses to fight after his dishonoring at the hands of Agamemnon, and only returns to the war due to unadulterated rage after Hector kills his close friend [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Achilles was known for uncontrollable rage that defined many of his bloodthirsty actions, such as defiling Hector's corpse by dragging it around the city of Troy. Achilles plays a tragic role in ''The Iliad'' brought about by constant [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TFUv2VRKd8C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=achilles+dehumanization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5D2sb_hGx_&amp;sig=iJrfJQdt0VhRVG2iJoRf-Nc6oqA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje8uWTosvJAhWGyT4KHZE7BUoQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=achilles%20dehumanization&amp;f=false de-humanization] throughout the epic, having his ''menis'' (wrath) overpower his ''philos'' (love).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Mortal Hero: An Introduction to Homer's Iliad|last = Schein|first = Seth|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroes in myth often had close but conflicted relationships with the gods. Thus Heracles's name means "the glory of [[Hera]]", even though he was tormented all his life by Hera, the Queen of the Gods. Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king [[Erechtheus]], whom [[Poseidon]] killed for choosing [[Athena]] over him as the city's patron god. When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], they invoked him as ''Poseidon  Erechtheus''.

[[Destiny|Fate]], or destiny, plays a massive role in the stories of classical heroes. The classical hero's heroic significance stems from battlefield conquests, an inherently dangerous action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The gods in [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]], when interacting with the heroes, often foreshadow the hero's eventual death on the battlefield. Countless heroes and gods go to great lengths to alter their  pre-destined fate, but with no success, as no immortal can change their prescribed outcomes by the [[Fates|three Fates]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/cms/lib03/WA01001938/Centricity/Domain/2205/Fate%20reading.pdf|title = Articles and musing on the concept of Fate for the ancient Greeks|date = |accessdate = |website = Auburn University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent example of this is found in ''[[Oedipus Rex]].'' After learning that his son, [[Oedipus]], will end up killing him, the King of Thebes, [[Laius]], takes huge steps to assure his son's death by removing him from the kingdom. But, Oedipus slays his father without an afterthought when he unknowingly encounters him in a dispute on the road many years later. The lack of recognition enabled Oedipus to slay his father, ironically further binding his father to his fate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Stories of heroism may serve as [[moral example]]s. However, classical heroes often didn't embody the Christian notion of an upstanding, perfectly moral hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Four Conceptions of the Heroic|url = http://www.fellowshipofreason.com/archives/4heroes.htm|website = www.fellowshipofreason.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Achilles's character-issues of hateful rage lead to merciless slaughter and his overwhelming pride lead to him only joining the Trojan War because he didn't want his soldiers to win all of the glory. Classical heroes, regardless of their morality, were placed in religion. In [[classical antiquity]], cults that venerated deified heroes such as [[Heracles]], [[Perseus]], and [[Achilles]] played an important role in Ancient Greek religion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Graf, Fritz. (2006) "Hero Cult." ''Brills New Pauly.'' Retrieved from http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/hero-cult-e511460?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.brill-s-new-pauly&amp;s.q=hero.&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient [[Greek hero cult]]s worshipped heroes from oral [[Epic Cycle|epic tradition]], with these heroes often bestowing blessings, especially healing ones, on individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Myth and monomyth==
[[File:JourneytotheWest.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The four heroes from the 16th-century Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'']]
The concept of the "Mythic Hero Archetype" was first developed by [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] in his 1936 book, ''The Hero, A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama''. It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world.  Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure is mythical.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Raglan. ''The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama by Lord Raglan'', Dover Publications, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a story archetype of the standard [[monomyth]]ical "hero's [[quest]]" that was reputed to be pervasive across all cultures is somewhat controversial. Expounded mainly by [[Joseph Campbell]] in his 1949 work ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', it illustrates several uniting themes of hero stories that hold similar ideas of what a hero represents, despite vastly different cultures and beliefs. The monomyth or Hero's Journey  consists of three separate stages including the Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages there are several archetypes that the hero or heroine may follow including the call to adventure (which they may initially refuse), supernatural aid, proceeding down a road of trials, achieving a realization about themselves (or an apotheosis), and attaining the freedom to live through their quest or journey. Campbell offered examples of stories with similar themes  such as [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Joseph Campbell in ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' Princeton University Press, 2004 [1949], 140, {{ISBN|0-691-11924-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the themes he explores is the androgynous hero, who combines male and female traits, like Bodhisattva: "The first wonder to be noted here is the androgynous character of the Bodhisattva: masculine Avalokiteshvara, feminine Kwan Yin."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his 1968 book, ''The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'', Campbell writes "It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adonis]], and [[Osiris]] cycles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Campbell]]. The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'' Penguin, reprinted, {{ISBN|0-14-004306-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavic fairy tales==
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Tsarevich]], a hero of [[Slavic mythology|Russian folklore]]]]
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of the Russian [[fairy tale]], concluded that a fairy tale had only eight ''[[dramatis personæ]]'', of which one was the hero,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p. 80}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian folklore. The actions that fall into such a hero's sphere include:
# Departure on a quest
# Reacting to the test of a [[Donor (fairy tale)|donor]]
# Marrying a princess (or similar figure)
Propp distinguished between ''seekers'' and ''victim-heroes''. A [[villain]] could initiate the issue by kidnapping the hero or driving him out; these were victim-heroes. On the other hand, an antagonist could rob the hero, or kidnap someone close to him, or, without the villain's intervention, the hero could realize that he lacked something and set out to find it; these heroes are seekers. Victims may appear in tales with seeker heroes, but the tale does not follow them both.&lt;ref name="Propp" /&gt;{{Rp|36}}

==Historical studies==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of history]] --&gt;
{{Further information|Philosophy of history|Great man theory}}
No history can be written without consideration of the lengthy list of [[List of medals for bravery|recipients of national medals for bravery]], populated by firefighters, policemen and policewomen, ambulance medics and ordinary have-a-go heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/25/1040511087609.html smh.com.au: "Everyday heroes"], 26 Dec 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These persons risked their lives to try to save or protect the lives of others: for example, the Canadian [[Cross of Valour (Canada)|Cross of Valour (C.V.)]] "recognizes acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13503 gg.ca: "Decorations for Bravery Ceremony"], 2 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; examples of recipients are [[Mary Dohey]] and [[David Gordon Cheverie]].

The philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] gave a central role to the "hero", personalized by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], as the incarnation of a particular culture's ''[[Volksgeist]]'', and thus of the general ''[[Zeitgeist]]''. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s 1841 ''On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History'' also accorded a key function to heroes and great men in history. Carlyle centered history on the [[biography]] of a few central individuals such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]. His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men included geniuses good and, perhaps for the first time in historical study, evil.

Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position were rare in the second part of the 20th century. Most in the [[philosophy of history]] school contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one that Carlyle used for his portraits. For example, [[Karl Marx]] argued that history was determined by the massive social forces at play in "[[class struggle]]s", not by the individuals by whom these forces are played out. After Marx, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote at the end of the 19th century: "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;Spencer, Herbert. ''[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=96277756  The Study of Sociology]'', Appleton, 1896, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] argued in [[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse|his analysis of societal communication and debate]] that history was mainly the "science of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]", until its inversion by the "historical and political popular discourse".

Modern examples of the typical hero are  [[Minnie Vautrin]], [[Norman Bethune]],  [[Alan Turing]], [[Raoul Wallenberg]], [[Chiune Sugihara]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Mother Teresa]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Oswaldo Paya]], [[Oscar Biscet]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].

The [[Annales School]], led by [[Lucien Febvre]], [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], would contest the exaggeration of the role of [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] in history. Indeed, Braudel distinguished various time scales, one accorded to the life of an individual, another accorded to the life of a few human generations, and the last one to [[civilization]]s, in which [[geography]], [[economics]] and [[demography]] play a role considerably more decisive than that of individual subjects.

Among noticeable events in the studies of the role of the hero and [[Great men theory|Great man]] in history one should mention [[Sydney Hook]]'s book (1943) ''[[Sidney Hook#The Hero in History|The Hero in History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, S. 1955 [1943]. The Hero in History. A Study in Limitation and Possibility. Boston, MA: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the twentieth century such male-focused theory has been contested, among others by feminists writers such as [[Judith Fetterley]] in ''The Resisting Reader'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Resisting Reader|last = Fetterley|first = Judith|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 1977|isbn = |location = Bloomington, IN|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and literary theorist [[Nancy K.

In the epoch of [[globalization]] an individual can still change the development of the country and of the whole world so this gives reasons to some scholars to suggest returning to the problem of the role of the hero in history from the viewpoint of modern historical knowledge and using up-to-date methods of historical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]]  2010. The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration. Social Evolution &amp; History, Vol. 9 No. 2 (pp. 95–136) [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129622/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the frameworks of developing [[counterfactual history]], attempts are made to examine some hypothetical scenarios of historical development. The hero attracts much attention because most of those scenarios are based on the suppositions: what would have happened if this or that historical individual had or had not been alive.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson. W. The Lead Economy Sequence in World Politics (From Sung China to the United States): Selected Counterfactuals. Journal of Globalization Studies.

== Gender differences ==
If the term "heroine" exists,{{clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}} "hero" is often the predominantly used term even though its neutrality can be put into question. The definitions of the heroine often refer back to the one of the hero, but sometimes insinuate that their deeds are of less value, or were obtained only thanks to their love of God or a country or of a man. Therefore, implying that an external explanation for the extraordinary nature of her deeds is needed to justify them. The warrior women is considered unholy, unnatural. These figures tend to be erased because they don't fit in the feminine values they are supposed to represent.
Acts of heroism coming from women are acceptable, during specific time, like when men are at war, during times of crisis, but they are otherwise often seen as suspicious. Moreover, women are often not individualized, but praised as a group for heroic deeds. [[Women in the military]] were often subordinated to tasks less likely to be praised than armed combat, and are rather praised for their courage as a general force, nurses during wartime are a good example of this phenomenon.
If their story gets told, they are made to fit in the acceptable script. Their story is told in a way as to match the expectations of [[femininity]] ex: maternal love, compassion, fidelity, resistance, defense. Etc. So the set of strengths in which a heroine could historically express her value are overall not the same and perceived as less valuable than their [[masculine]] counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;

If they get mentioned in history, the way their story is told also differs from their male counterpart, they are generally portrayed as young and beautiful, their actions are limited to a short time
lapse in opposition to the possibility of a long heroic career for male heroes, underlying feelings that led to their heroic acts are underlined, overall less details about their life are kept and
emphasis is put over their tragic death. Not to forget that heroes and heroines are part of a social construct, their history is told and changes throughout history to serve different purposes of memory, propaganda according to diverse social, political or religious evolutions.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Further information|Vanity Fair (novel)|Superhero}}

[[File:Batman_and_Robin_1966.JPG|thumb|225x225px|[[Batman]] ([[Adam West]]) and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (Burt Ward) in the 1966–1968 TV Series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''.]]
	 
The word "hero" or "heroine", in modern times, is sometimes used to describe the [[protagonist]] or the [[Romantic interest (theatre)|love interest]] of a story, a usage which can conflict with the superhuman expectations of heroism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A classic example is [[Anna Karenina]], the lead character in the novel of the same title by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In modern literature the hero is more and more a problematic concept. In 1848, for example, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] gave ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' the subtitle ''A Novel without a Hero'', and imagined a world in which no sympathetic character was to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p. 34, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vanity Fair'' is a satirical representation of the absence of truly moral heroes in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Shmoop Editorial Team. (2008, November 11). ''Vanity Fair Theme of Morality and Ethics''. Retrieved December 6, 2015, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.shmoop.com/vanity-fair-thackeray/morality-ethics-theme.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on the characters Emmy Sedley and Becky Sharpe (the latter as the clearly defined anti-hero), with the plot focused on the eventual marriage of these two characters to rich men, revealing character flaws as the story progresses. Even the most sympathetic characters, like Captain Dobbin, are susceptible to weakness, as he is often narcissistic and melancholy.

The larger-than-life hero is a more common feature of [[fantasy]] (particularly in [[Comic book|comic-books]] and [[High fantasy|epic fantasy]]) than more realist works.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]:  The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 5 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these larger-than life figures remain prevalent in society. The [[superhero]] genre is a multibillion-dollar industry that includes comic books, movies, toys and video games. Superheroes usually possess extraordinary talents and powers that no living human could ever emulate. The superhero stories often pit a [[Supervillain|super villain]] against the hero, with the hero fighting the crime caused by the super villain. Examples of long-running superheroes include [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

==Psychology==
[[Social psychology]] has begun paying attention to heroes and heroism. Zeno Franco and [[Philip Zimbardo]] point out differences between heroism and altruism, and they offer evidence that observers' perceptions of unjustified risk plays a role above and beyond risk type in determining the ascription of heroic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franco | first1 = Z. | last2 = Blau | first2 = K. | last3 = Zimbardo | first3 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Heroism: A conceptual analysis and differentiation between heroic action and altruism | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-07260-001/ | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 99–113 | doi=10.1037/a0022672| citeseerx = 10.1.1.366.8315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for heroic risk-taking is that it is a [[costly signal]] demonstrating the ability of the hero. It can be seen as one form of [[altruism]] for which there are also several other evolutionary explanations.&lt;ref name=AEP1&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S.

Roma Chatterji has suggested that the hero or more generally protagonist is first and foremost a symbolic representation of the person who is experiencing the story while reading, listening or watching;&lt;ref name=Chatterji&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterji|first=Roma|date=January 1986|title=The Voyage of the Hero: The Self and the Other in One Narrative Tradition of Purulia|journal=Contributions to Indian Sociology|issue=19|pages=95–114|doi=10.1177/006996685019001007|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the relevance of the hero to the individual relies a great deal on how much similarity there is between the two. One reason for the hero-as-self interpretation of stories and myths is the human inability to view the world from any perspective but a personal one.

In the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', [[Ernest Becker]] argues that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic [[survival mechanism]]. Becker explains that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the [[dilemma]] of mortality through [[heroism]], by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's "[[immortality]] project" (or "''[[causa sui]]'' project"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality.  By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal; something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things. Another theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional "hero-systems", such as [[religion]], are no longer convincing in the [[Age of Enlightenment|age of reason]]. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do, because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing "illusions" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world. [[Terror Management Theory]] has generated evidence supporting this perspective.

[[Image:Bride-groom-kiss.jpg|thumb|right|A newly [[wedding|wed]] husband kissing his bride]]
A '''husband''' is a [[male]] in a [[marriage|marital relationship]]. The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his [[spouse]] and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between cultures and have varied over time.

In [[monogamy|monogamous]] cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage. This is enforced by legal codes that outlaw two ([[bigamy]]) or more ([[polygamy]]) female spouses. Similarly, [[polyandry]], marriage of one female partner with more than one male partner at the same time is not permitted. In polygamous and polyandrous cultures, there may be more than two parties to a marriage.

In marriages where both spouses are [[Man|men]], both may be referred to as husband.

In [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] marriages, the husband was traditionally regarded as the [[household|head of the household]] and was expected to be the sole provider or [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]], a role that is still maintained in some cultures (sometimes described as [[paternalistic]]).

The term continues to be applied to such a man who has [[Legal separation|separated]] from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a [[widower]]; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the "ex-husband" of his former spouse.

In today's society a husband is not necessarily considered the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the family,{{By whom|date=December 2017}} especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career.  In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.

==Origin and etymology==
The term ''husband'' refers to [[Middle English]] ''huseband'', from [[Old English]] ''hūsbōnda'', from [[Old Norse]] ''hūsbōndi'' (''hūs'', "house" + ''bōndi'', ''būandi'', present participle of ''būa'', "to dwell", so, etymologically, "a householder").

==Related terms==
At the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the [[Social status|status]] of married person and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband.  In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a [[wife]]; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband; between females, each is called a wife. Regardless of gender, a married person is the spouse of the other party to the marriage.

Although "husband" is a close term to [[bridegroom|groom]], the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place.

In some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, he or his family may have received a [[dowry]], or have had to pay a [[bride price]], or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2005, ''dowry''&lt;/ref&gt;  He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as [[dowager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/dower|title=Dower - Definition of dower by Merriam-Webster|work=m-w.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Husband" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar [[husbandry]],&lt;ref&gt;See Wiktionary {{linktext|husbandry}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the "control or judicious use of resources", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its [[profession]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

As an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a [[wedding ring]] on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition.

==Western culture==

===Historical status===
[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]] 
In premodern heterosexual unions ([[ancient Roman]], [[medieval]], and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The  father (as the "[[patron]]") was awarded with much [[authority]], differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_mommsen_1_5_2.htm|title=The History of Rome, by Theodor Mommsen  Book I Chapter 5 Section 2|work=About.com Ancient/Classical History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern]] European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_45/page6.cfm|title=SGN Page 6|author=|date=|website=www.sgn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650–1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a husband in a heterosexual marriage had more opportunities in society than his wife, who was not recognized as legally independent.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary status===
In contemporary [[secularized]] Western culture, the rights of the spouses have been made equal. The [[civil marriage]] generally forces the wealthier spouse "''breadwinner''" to provide [[alimony]] to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also [[Law and divorce around the world]]).

The legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the [[biological father]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

===Islam===
In [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam|various rights and obligations]] that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the [[Qur'an]].

Many Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heba Kotb|Heba G. Kotb MD]], [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm Sexuality in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125251/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm |date=9 July 2011 }}, PhD Thesis, Maimonides University, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is the only major religion that puts a cap on [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]], limiting the number of a man's wives to four—provided the husband can do justice to all of them. Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage.

There is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Marriage in Hinduism}}
A Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home. He is expected to provide for her and to prove his abilities to do so. The marriage in Hinduism is a relationship for Seven births (सात जन्मों का रिश्ता). Before 1951 there was no divorce allowed in Hindu marriage. In past before 1750CE equal rights were given to both men and women and the same was extended in marriage as well.

In modern times once again after 1951, equal rights for women through society and law jurisdiction is given. In Hinduism, based on the different regions, marriage process is observed differently with the same Saat Pheras around agni kund (light pyre) to be taken to become a husband and wife.

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] mentions that "In Hindu law, the male members of a joint family, together with their wives, widows, and children, are entitled to support out of the joint property."&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Economic aspects of family law (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Chinese folk religions===
China's family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People's Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
In Christianity, according to the Bible, a husband in a heterosexual marriage has a number of honors:
* To present his bride to God throughout their lives as perfectly holy and virtuous as can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%253A26-27&amp;version=ESV|title=Ephesians 53A26-27 ESV -  - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To protect his wife with his own life, physically, emotionally and "spiritually".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm|title=Ephesians 5:28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To "lay down" his life, counting her more important than himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm|title=Ephesians 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To lead his wife and his family into the best things for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-29.htm|title=Ephesians 5:29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church--|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To be the best that he can be in God's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm|title=Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To not withhold his body from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm|title=1 Corinthians 7:5 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cultures==
In Japan, before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriages (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expectation of fidelity==
{{Main article|Adultery|Open marriage}}
Although there is generally an expectation for a spouse not to have [[sexual relation]]s with anyone other than his spouse(s), historically, in most cultures, this expectation was not as strong as in the case of wives, a situation which was evident in legal codes which prohibited adultery, with male adultery often being criminalized only if "aggravating" circumstances existed, such as if he brought his mistress in the conjugal home, or if there was public scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=NtitRt1uUXMC |title=Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The double standard was also evident in divorce laws of many countries, such as the UK or Australia, which differentiated between female adultery, which was a ground of adultery by itself, and male adultery, which was a ground only under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/seminars/finlay.html&lt;/ref&gt; This double standard continues to be seen today in many parts of the world. For instance, in the Philippines, a wife can be charged with the crime of a''dultery'' (for merely having one act of sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband), while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of c''oncubinage'', which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|title=Gender Equality in Philippines - Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|work=genderindex.org|access-date=22 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430025115/http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|archive-date=30 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/a-brief-discussion-on-infidelity-concubinage-adultery-and-bigamy/|title=A brief discussion on Infidelity, Concubinage, Adultery and Bigamy|work=Philippine e-Legal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breach of this expectation of [[fidelity]] is commonly referred to as [[adultery]] or [[extramarital sex]]. Historically, adultery has been considered a serious [[offense (law)|offense]], sometimes a crime. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], it may affect the status of children, the [[custody of children]], etc.

'''Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|proporzec Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej – Zwierzchnika Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej}}) is a [[Maritime flag#Jacks|jack flag]] used in the [[Polish Armed Forces]] to mark the presence and pay respect to the [[President of the Republic of Poland]] who is also ''ex officio'' the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Armed Forces. The jack is raised on [[Polish Navy]] ships when the president is officially on board, as well as on land, if the president is present. The design of the jack is based directly on the [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|pre-war]] [[Banner of Poland|Banner of the Republic of Poland]] which used to be part of presidential insignia.

== Legal specifications ==
[[File:Presidential jack unknown soldier.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Presidential jack flying at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw]] during a [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution Day]] ceremony]]

The jack of the President is defined in the Ordinance of the Minister of National Defense on the Use of Insignia of the Armed Forces of January 26, 1996 with subsequent amendments. The ordinance defines the jack of the President as "a piece of red cloth with the image of the state eagle (i.e. the White Eagle from the [[Coat of Arms of Poland|national coat of arms]]) in the middle, bordered with a ''wężyk generalski''", an ornate wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of [[generał|general's]] rank. The [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] to [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]] ratio is 5:6. The proportion of the eagle's height to the fly is 3:5.&lt;ref name=ordinance&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 29 stycznia 1996 r. w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm M.P.96.14.178] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015219/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The presidential jack is used in military ceremonies attended by the commander-in-chief. Celebrations of the Constitution Day, May 3; Polish Armed Forces Day, August 15; and Independence Day, November 11 (see [[Public holidays in Poland]]) are typical occasions. For example, during the grand military parade on August 15, 2007 in [[Warsaw]], President [[Lech Kaczyński]] rode in a convertible jeep preceded by a mounted [[Polish cavalry|cavalry]] officer carrying the presidential jack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
while a smaller jack was attached to the president's jeep as a car flag. The jack also draped the coffins of President Kaczyński (see [[Death and state funeral of Lech Kaczyński and Maria Kaczyńska]]) and former President-in-exile [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]] after both died in the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk air crash]] of 2010.

== History ==
[[File:Banner of Poland.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Banner of the Republic on display in the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]

{{Main article|Banner of Poland}}

A state banner was used in Poland as insignia of the head of state (king, president, etc.) as early as the 11th century CE. Although its design changed with time, it was always a heraldic banner, i.e. one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle in a red field. In 1919, the [[Sejm]] (lower house of parliament) established the [[Banner of the Republic of Poland]], reserved for use by the head of state &amp;ndash; the State Leader (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'') and, later, President of the Republic. In 1927, it was modified to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms. At this point the banner was virtually identical to the current design for the presidential jack.&lt;ref name=znamier&gt;{{cite book

 | location = Warsaw
 | pages = 299
 | isbn = 83-7115-055-5|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the Banner of the Republic was still used by [[Polish government-in-exile|presidents-in-exile]] while a variant with a crownless eagle was used by Communist authorities at home. Officially abandoned in 1955, the banner continued to be used in practice by the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|prime minister]] and, during the 1960s, by the [[Polish Council of State|Council of State]], a collective head of state of the time.&lt;ref name=znamier/&gt;

The modern Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland was established by the Minister of National Defense on January 29, 1996 with the sole purpose of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board.&lt;ref name=ordinance/&gt; On December 14, 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of Polish Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 14 grudnia 2005 r. zmieniające zarządzenie w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm M.P.05.82.1165] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033325/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw]] on May 3, 2005.

The project began in 2016 as an [[Instagram]] profile. By April 2018, the account had amassed more than a million followers by portraying the lifestyle of an Instagram it-girl over social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lilmiquela-instagram_uk_57c94056e4b085cf1ecdc0af|title=Instagram's Latest 'It' Model Is Confusing The Hell Out Of Everyone|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account also details a fictional narrative which presents Miquela as a sentient robot in conflict with other digital projects created by McFedries and Decou.

In August 2017, Miquela released her first single, "Not Mine".&lt;ref name="billboard.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7898117/miquela-virtual-singer-instagram-not-mine-song-stream|title=Virtual Singer &amp; Internet Star Miquela Shares Debut Single 'Not Mine'|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her pivot into a music has been compared to virtual musicians [[Gorillaz]] and [[Hatsune Miku]].&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;

==Origins==
Miquela’s first Instagram post was made on April 22, 2016. The project garnered both intrigue and criticism for the character's digital appearance with fans and online commenters oscillating between positing that Miquela is an art project or a social experiment carried out by a real unidentified woman. Miquela was rumored to be a marketing gimmick for ''[[The Sims]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} British model Emily Bador was rumored to be Miquela, fans citing the character's abundance of freckles. Bador openly acknowledged the physical similarity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Online presence==
Miquela has been pictured with a number of celebrities including [[Diplo]], [[How to Dress Well]], killerandasweetthang founder Eileen Kelly, [[Molly Soda]], [[Nile Rogers]], and [[Samantha Urbani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/|title=*~ MIQUELA ~* (@lilmiquela) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been interviewed and or profiled in a number of publications including Refinery29, Vogue, Buzzfeed, v-files, Nylon, the Guardian, Business of Fashion, The Cut, and BBC.com.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} As well as by Shane Dawson, YouTube celebrity, in a [https://youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI phone interview]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=shane|title=CONSPIRACY THEORIES &amp; INTERVIEW WITH LIL MIQUELA|date=2017-09-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Online narratives===
In April 2018, a trans-media story began to play out on Miquela's Instagram involving [https://www.instagram.com/blawko22 @Blawko22], and [https://www.instagram.com/bermudaisbae/ @BermudaIsBae], two other virtual Instagram accounts who are presented as "sentient robots." The story suggests that two organizations are responsible for the creation of these sentient robots. In the narrative, fictional brand Brud created Miquela and "Blawko22" while competing fictional brand Cain Intelligence created "BermudaIsBae".

On April 17, all of Miquela's Instagram posts were removed. "BermudaIsBae" was purported to have hacked Miquela's account. The two online personas then began posting pictures together as Miquela worked to reclaim the original account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BhuruzXHetm/?taken-by=bermudaisbae|title=Bermuda on Instagram: "More emotional than I thought it would be.

We talked it…"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reclaiming the account, Miquela posted a series of notes saying that she is a robot and claiming sentience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkjEPEuFdp0/?taken-by=lilmiquela|title=Lil Miquela on Instagram: "So I pull up to the trail and there she is.

==Music career==

Her musical style is characterized by the use of [[auto-tune]] and [[trap music|trap]]-influenced production. Her music has been released on [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]]. Miquela's sound is purportedly based off of the soundtrack to Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic, [[Evil Dead]].

This is a '''list of notable travelers''', consisting of people that are known for their travels or explorations. Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, and can be one way or round trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/travel "Travel."] (definition). [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Thefreedictionary.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/travel "Travel."] (definition). [http://www.merriam-webster.com Merriam-webster.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.

[[Saint]] '''Lupus of Sens''' (or '''Saint Loup de Sens''') (born c. 573; died c. 623)&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA716#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Sens |first=Georges |last=Goyau |editor1-last=Herberman |editor1-first=Charles G.|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia|The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |others=Volume 13: Revelation–Simon Stock |publisher=The Encyclopedia Press |location=New York |year=1913 |page=716|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early French [[bishop of Sens]].

He was the son of Betton, Count of Tonnerre, "[[Blessed Betto]]," a member of the [[royal house]] of the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Church in Saint-Loup-de-Naud==

The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church dedicated to Saint Loup at [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud|Naud]], 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Provins]] in Champagne in the east of France is distinguished by the outstanding sculptures in the porch of its great doorway, with an ambitious [[iconography|iconographic program]] in which Saint Loup mediates entry into the mystery of the [[Trinity]]. About 980, Sevinus, [[archbishop of Sens]], made a gift to the [[Benedictine order|Benedictine community]] of the [[abbey of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif]] at Sens of four altars ''in villa que dicitus Naudus, in honore sancti lupi consecratum''&amp;mdash;"in the demesne that is called Naud, consecrated in honor of Saint Loup"&amp;mdash;betokening the presence of a shrine already on this site, a priory under the direction of the abbot of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif. Other documents mention [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud]] among the possessions of the abbey at Sens, seat of an archbishop with close political ties to the French Crown, who had Paris within his diocese. Thus, though it lay so close to Provins, a seat of the [[counts of Champagne]] and the abbey church was completed by Henri le Libéral, comte de Champagne, the priory at Saint-Loup-de-Naud looked to Sens for its patronage: a visit from the abbot is documented in 1120. In 1160/61 Hugues de Toucy, Archbishop of Sens, presented to the priory the relic of Saint Loup, brought from the abbey of Sainte-Colombe, to that community's dismay;&lt;ref&gt;William W. Kibler, ed., ''Medieval France: an encyclopedia'', ''s.v.'' "Saint-Loup-de-Naud".&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpted ''portail'' with an iconography comparable to the royal portal at [[Chartres]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark Maines, ''The Western Portals at Saint-Loup-de-Naud'', (New York: Garland) 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; was doubtless undertaken shortly thereafter, when [[pilgrimage]]s brought wealth to the community.

The priory was laid waste by the English in 1432, during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and again by the [[Huguenots]] in 1567, during the [[French Wars of Religion]].

==Other saints Lupus/Loup==

Numerous communes of France are named Saint-Loup;&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of French places with this name, see [[Saint-Loup (disambiguation)|Saint-Loup]]. There is also a Saint-Loup in [[Namur (city)|Namur]], Belgium, and another in Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; they commemorate several venerable early saints with the Latinized Germanic name of ''Lupus'' ("wolf"): besides Saint Loup de Sens, venerated in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], [[Île-de-France]] and [[Picardy]] there are [[Lupus of Troyes|Saint Loup de Troyes]], Saint Loup de [[Bayeux]], one of the early Bishops of Bayeux; and—more locally venerated—Saint Loup de [[Limoges]], Saint Loup de [[Soissons]], and Saint Loup de [[Châlons-en-Champagne]]. A number of the communes called Saint-Loup in the west of France are not easily connected with a specific Saint Loup.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9425">{{for|a family name inherited from one's mother (and maternal grandmother, etc.)|Matriname}}
A '''matronymic''' is a [[personal name]] based on the [[given name]] of one's mother, grandmother, or any female ancestor. It is the female equivalent of a [[patronymic]]. Around the world, '''matronymic surnames''' are far less common than [[patronymic surname]]s. In some cultures in the past, matronymic last names were often given to children of unwed mothers. Or if a woman was especially well known or powerful, her descendants might adopt a matronym based on her name.

==Terminology in English==

The word ''matronymic'' is first attested in English in 1794 and originates in the [[Greek language|Greek]] μήτηρ ''mētēr'' "mother" (&lt;small&gt;[[Genitive case|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; μητρός ''mētros'' whence the [[combining form]] μητρo- ''mētro''-),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|mh/thr|μήτηρ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ὄνυμα ''onyma'', a variant form of ὄνομα ''onoma'' "name",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)/noma|ὄνομα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the suffix [[wikt:-ικός|-ικός]] -''ikos'', which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense "pertaining to" (thus "pertaining to the mother's name"). The Greek word μητρωνυμικός ''mētrōnymikos''&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|mhtrwnumiko/s|μητρωνυμικός|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; was then borrowed into Latin in a partially Latinised form (Greek ''mētēr'', dialectally ''mātēr'', corresponds to Latin ''mater''),&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|mater|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''matronomicus''. These words were a source for coining the English ''matronymic'' as the female counterpart to ''patronymic'' (first attested in English in 1612).&lt;ref&gt;"matronymic, n. and adj.". OED Online, 3rd edition. March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records an English noun ''patronym'' in [[free variation]] with the noun ''patronymic'', it does not, however, record a corresponding noun ''matronym''.

More rarely, English speakers use forms based wholly on Greek: the noun ''metronym'' (first attested in 1904); and the noun and adjective ''metronymic'' (first attested in 1868).&lt;ref&gt;"metronymic, n. and adj."; "metronym, n.". ''OED Online'', 3rd edn. March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These are, for example, the forms used in the 2016 ''The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland'', ed. by Patrick Hanks, Richard Coates, Peter McClure (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
===India===
The matrilineal communities in South and North-East India, like the [[Bunt (community)|Bunts]] and [[Khasi_people|Khasi]], have family names which are inherited from their mother. Matronymic names are common in Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/2594/12/12_chapter%203.pdf Mother's name becoming common in naming conventions in Kerala (page 201)], shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in; accessed May 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Daughters take the names of their mothers as the second part of their name.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

===Indonesia===
The [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of [[Indonesia]] are the largest group of people who use this naming system. People of [[Enggano Island]] also use a matronymic system. They also have family name/surname (marga).

===Philippines===
[[Filipino name]]s legally have the [[maiden name]] of the child's mother as a [[middle name]] as opposed to Anglo-American use of secondary or tertiary given names. Filipino children born to [[unwed mother]]s, if not claimed by the father nor adopted by anyone else, automatically bear their mother's maiden name and sometimes middle name.

===Vietnam===
Some [[Vietnamese names]] also function this way, as less of a "tradition" than a style or trend, in which the mother's maiden name is the child's middle name.

==Europe==

===England===
Although many English matronyms were given to children of unwed mothers, it was not unusual for children of married women to also use a matronymic surname. For instance, it was traditional during the Middle Ages for [[posthumous birth|children whose fathers died before their births]] to use a matronym, and it was not unheard of for children to be given a matronym if the father's name was foreign, difficult to pronounce, or had an unfortunate meaning. A child of a strong-minded woman might also take a matronym, as might a child whose name would otherwise be confused with that of a cousin or neighbour. There are even instances where royal houses used matronymics to strengthen claims to the English throne  – for example, Princess Matilda's eldest son was known as [[Henry FitzEmpress]] (-[[fitz]] meaning "son of" from Latin ''filius''). Common English matronyms include Beaton, Custer, Tiffany, Parnell, Hilliard, Marriott, Ibbetson, Babbs, and Megson.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, William Dodgson. ''The Story of Surnames''. London, George Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1932. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In the old Finnish system, women were standardly given matronyms, while men were given patronyms, for example, Ainontytär (female) or Pekanpoika (male). Since the 19th century the system of inherited family names has been used, however, and today nearly all Finns have inherited surnames.

===France===
Family names derived from matronyms are found in [[France]], especially in [[Normandy]]: Catherine, Marie, Jeanne, Adeline. In medieval Normandy ([[Duchy of Normandy]]), a matronym might be used when the mother was of greater prominence than the father or the basis for a claim of inheritance, such as in the cases of [[Henry II of England|Henry FitzEmpress]] and [[Robert FitzWimarc]].

===Iceland===
{{see|Icelandic name}}
Some [[Iceland]]ic people, like [[Heiðar Helguson]], have matronyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_life/?cat_id=16571&amp;ew_0_a_id=302030|title=In the Name of the Father|first=Iceland|last=Review|date=5 March 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland and Wales===
Matronymics appear in medieval Celtic tales such as ''[[Cath Maige Tuired]]'' and the Fourth Branch of the [[Mabinogi]] (the children of [[Dôn]]).

===Netherlands===

Matronymics are accepted in the Netherlands but are generally written as given names on identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/naam/eindigtop/zoon|title=NVB : voornaam eindigt op 'zoon'|first=Meertens|last=Instituut|website=www.meertens.knaw.nl|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
Family names derived from matronyms are also found in [[Romania]], especially in the region of [[Moldavia]]. Examples include: Aioanei, Ababei, Acatrinei, Ailincăi.

===Russia===
Family names derived from matronyms are also found in [[Russia]]. Examples include: Katin, Mashkov, Annushkin. [[Oleg Yaroslavich]], 12th century prince of Galich, was known as Oleg Nastasyich during his life to distinguish his claim from that of his half-brother Vladimir.

==Middle East==
===Arabic===
An example of an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] matronymic is the name of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] in the Qur'an, ‘Īsá ibn Maryam, which means Jesus the son of Mary. The book ''Kitāb man nusiba ilá ummihi min al-shu‘arā’'' (The book of poets who are named with the lineage of their mothers) by the 9th-century author Muḥammad ibn Ḥabīb is a study of the matronymics of Arabic poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/594132|publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 62, No. 3 (September 1942), pp. 156-71|title=Muḥammad Ibn Ḥabīb's "Matronymics of Poets"|last=Levi della Vida|first= Giorgio|pages=156–71|author2=Ḥabīb, MuḥAmmad Ibn|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=62|issue=3|year=1942|jstor=594132|last3=Habib|first3=Muhammad Ibn}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist other examples of matronymics in historical Arabic.

===Jewish===
Most characters in the [[Bible]] are referred to with a patronymic. However, [[Abishai (Bible)|Abishai]], [[Joab]], and [[Asahel]] – the sons of [[Zeruiah]], sister or stepsister of [[King David]] – are invariably referred to as "Sons of Zeruiah" and the name of their father remains unknown. Also the Biblical Judge [[Shamgar]] is referred to with the matronymic "Son of [[Anat]]".{{cn|date=May 2017}}

There are indications of a Jewish history of matronymic names. Specifically, in East European Jewish society, there appeared various matronymic family names such as [[Rivlin]] (from [[Rivka]]/[[Rebecca]]), [[Sorkin]] (from [[Sarah]]), [[Zeitlin]] (from Zeitl), [[Rochlin]] (from [[Rachel]]), [[Feiglin]] (from [[Feige]]), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/474406|publisher=JSTOR: The Biblical World, Vol. 36, No. 6 (Dec., 1910 ), pp. 407-14|title=Traces of the Matronymic Family in the Hebrew Social Organization|last=Cross|first= Earle Bennett|pages=407–14|journal=The Biblical World|volume=36|issue=6|year=1910|jstor=3141456}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain Jewish prayers and blessings, matronyms are used, e.g., "Joseph ''ben'' (son of) Miriam".{{cn|date=May 2017}}

The '''Munros of Auchinbowie''' (sometimes spelt Monro) are a distinguished branch of the [[Scotland|Scottish]], highland [[Clan Munro]]. From this family three Professors of Anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland were produced, as well as several other doctors and military officers.

==Lineage==
===17th century===
[[File:Monro_RCSEd.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]] the surgeon of Edinburgh University whose descendants later succeeded to the Auchinbowie property]]
The progenitor of the Munros of Auchinbowie is generally regarded as [[Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts]] who served as a major in an infantry regiment and saw action at the [[Battle of Worcester]] in 1651.  He later took up a career of politics. His ancestry can be traced to [[Munro of Milntown|Andrew Munro, 4th of Milntown]] who descends from [[Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis]] (d.1425), an early chief of the Clan Munro of Ross-shire, Scotland.

Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts had seven children:

#[[George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie]] (1666–1721) who was famed for his victory over the Jacobites at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]] in 1689.  He came into ownership of Auchinbowie, a property about four miles south of [[Stirling]] through his wife Margaret Bruce of Auchinbowie. Later as a Major in Sir Charles Graham's Regiment of Foot he fought at the [[Siege of Namur (1695)]].   
#Archibald Munro born in 1666 and died in 1697.
#[[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]] a surgeon at the [[University of Edinburgh]], whose descendants would later succeed to the estates of Auchinbowie.
#Margaret Munro.
#Lillias Munro.
#Jean Munro. Married William, second son of Sir William Sempil of Cathcart.
#Mary Munro.

===18th century===
George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie had three children:
[[File:Auchibowie House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Auchinbowie House, near [[Stirling]], [[Scotland]]]]
#Alexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie who married Anne, daughter of [[Stewart Baronets|Sir Robert Stewart, Lord Tillicoultry]] in 1719.
#[[George Monro (British Army officer)|George Monro]] (1700–1757) who was a British Army officer famed for his resolute but ultimately unsuccessful defense of [[Fort William Henry]] in 1757 during the [[Seven Years' War]] / [[French and Indian War]] which was made famous by the novel and later the film ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. However, when [[John Alexander Inglis]] wrote his history of the Monro of Auchinbowie family in 1911, he had not at that time identified the younger George Monro as a member of the family.&lt;ref name="Inglis2"&gt;Holden, James A. and Inglis, John Alexander. (1913). ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/42889472?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Lineage of Colonel George Monro - Proceedings of the New York State Historical Association]''. '''Volume 13'''. pp. 389 - 403.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Margaret Munro - born 1707.

Alexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie (d.1742)  had nine children: 
#George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie (1721–1793) who was an army surgeon who served in the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd Highlanders]] otherwise known as the ''Black Watch'' under the chief of the Clan Munro; Colonel [[Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet]]. In 1750 George was Surgeon in [[William Maule, 1st Earl Panmure]]'s [[25th Regiment of Foot]]. He saw active service in Germany and afterwards in the war against the French in America. In 1781 he was appointed Physician General to the garrison in [[Menorca]] and went through six months siege by the French and Spanish.
#Alexander Munro, a writer in [[Edinburgh]]. (1724–1750).
#John Munro.
#Cecil Munro. (1719–1786)
#Five other children - all died young.

George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had two sons:

#Major George Munro who married Elizabeth Aylmer. They had two sons and one daughter.
#[[Hector William Munro|Lieutenant-General Hector William Munro, 1st of Edmondsham]] (d. 1821) was [[List of Governors of Trinidad|Governor of Trinidad]] and who married Philadelphia Bower of [[Edmondsham]]. They had three sons and four daughters.

==Alexander Monro (primus)==
[[File:Alexander Monro primus.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Alexander Monro ''primus'', 4th of Auchinbowie]]
Although George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had male heirs as mentioned above, he sold the Auchinbowie property to a cousin, [[Alexander Monro (primus)]] who was the son of [[John Monro (surgeon)]], who was in turn a younger brother of George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie. Alexander Monro (primus) was the founder of the [[Edinburgh Medical School]].  He was appointed lecturer on [[Anatomy]] by the Surgeons' Company at [[Edinburgh]] in 1719; two years later he became professor, and in 1725 was admitted to the [[University of Edinburgh|University]]. He was a principal promoter and early clinical lecturer in the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. Alexander Monro (primus) had six children:

#[[John Monro (advocate)|John Monro, 5th of Auchinbowie]], advocate, born 5 November 1725 and married Sophia, eldest daughter of Archibald Inglis of Auchindinny. He died in May 1789.
#[[Donald Monro (doctor)|Dr Donald Monro]] (1728–1802), married Dorothea Maria Heineken.
#Jean Monro (1729–1731).
#Mary Monro - born 1730.
#[[Alexander Monro (secundus)]], 1st of Craiglockhart and Cockburn. (1733–1817)
#Margaret Monro (1757–1802).

==Alexander Monro (secundus)==
[[File:Alexander Munro secundus.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Alexander Monro ''secundus'']]
Alexander Monro (primus) was succeeded in the property of Auchibowie by his eldest son John Monro, 5th of Auchinbowie who was in turn succeeded by a daughter. However he was succeeded in his profession by his third son [[Alexander Monro (secundus)]] who was Professor of Anatomy in [[Edinburgh]]. He took his degree as Doctor of Medicine on 20 October 1775. He then proceeded to his studies abroad. He spent a short time in [[London]], where he attended the lectures of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|Dr William Hunter]]. He next visited [[Paris]] and on 17 September 1757 entered [[Leiden University]] where he formed a friendship with two famous anatomists, [[Bernhard Siegfried Albinus]] and [[Petrus Camper]]. However his foreign studies were principally prosecuted at [[Berlin]], where he worked under the celebrated Professor Meckel, in whose house he lived. Alexander spent some time in Edinburgh during early 1757 in order to fill the place of his father, who was confined to the house by illness. He finally was admitted a licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] on 2 May 1758 and as a Fellow on 1 May 1759. He had four children:

#Isabella Monro who married Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Cott of Gala. She died in 1801.
#[[Alexander Monro (tertius)]], 2nd of Craiglockhart and Cockburn. (1773–1859).
#David Monro (1776–1843).
#Charlotte Monro (1782–1822).

==Alexander Monro (tertius)==
[[File:Alexander Munro tertius.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Alexander Monro ''tertius'']]
[[Alexander Monro (tertius)]] followed his father and grandfather in becoming professor of anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Amongst his publications are "Outlines of the Anatomy of the Human Body" (1811) in four volumes and "Elements of Anatomy" (1825) in two volumes. He was Secretary of the Royal College of Physicians from 1809 to 1819 and President in 1827 and 1828. He was also on the Council of the [[Wernerian Natural History Society]] of which he became a member in 1811. He had been elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1798 and at his death was father of the Society. He had 12 children:

#Alexander Monro (1803–1867), was a Captain in the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]], married Elizabeth, daughter of C. B Scott of Woll.
#James Monro (1806–1870), was a Surgeon-Major in the [[Coldstream Guards]], married Maria, daughter of Colonel Duffin.
#Henry Monro (1810–1869), married Jane Christie. One of their sons was [[Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet]]
#[[David Monro|Sir David Monro]] (1813–1877), married Dinah, daughter of John Secker. They had five sons including [[Charles John Monro]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright-St Clair, Rex. "Monro, David 1813 - 1877". Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Ministry for Culture and Heritage.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natascha Maria Kampusch''' (born 17 February 1988) is an Austrian woman who was [[Child abduction|abducted]] at the age of 10 on 2 March 1998 and held in a secret [[Basement|cellar]] by her [[Kidnapping|kidnapper]] [[Wolfgang Přiklopil]] for more than eight years, until she escaped on 23 August 2006. She has written a book about her ordeal, ''3,096 Days'' (2010), upon which the 2013 German film ''[[3096]]'' is based.

== Early years and family ==
Kampusch was raised by her mother, Brigitta Sirny (née Kampusch), and her father, Ludwig Koch, in [[Vienna]], Austria. Her early life with her mother was reportedly not a happy one, according to Ludwig Adamovich, head of a special commission looking into possible police failures in the investigation of the kidnapping. He claimed that "the time Kampusch was imprisoned might have been better for her than what she experienced before", a statement absolutely denied by Brigitta Sirny, who threatened to sue the commission chief over his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2009-08-05/15306/Kampusch_mum_may_sue_commission_chief |title=Kampusch mum may sue commission chief – General News – Austrian Times Online News – English Newspaper |publisher=Austriantimes.at |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her family included two adult sisters, and five nieces and nephews. Sirny and Koch separated while Kampusch was still a child and divorced after her abduction. Kampusch spent time with both of them, and had returned to her mother's home from a holiday with Koch the day before her kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Kidnapping ==
The 10-year-old Kampusch left her family's residence in [[Vienna]]'s [[Donaustadt]] district on the morning of 2 March 1998, but failed to arrive at school or come home. A 12-year-old witness reported having seen her being dragged into a white minibus by two men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Captivity ===
During the eight years of her captivity, Kampusch was held in a small cellar underneath Přiklopil's garage. The entrance was concealed behind a cupboard. The cellar only had {{convert|5|sqm}} of space. It had a door made of concrete and was reinforced with steel. The room had no windows and was soundproof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5285048.stm | title = Inside the Austrian girl's 'dungeon' | publisher = BBC Online | date=25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first six months of her captivity, Kampusch was not allowed to leave the chamber at any time, and for several years of her captivity she was not allowed to leave the tiny space at night. Afterwards, she spent increasing amounts of time upstairs in the rest of the house, but each night was sent back to the chamber to sleep, as well as while Přiklopil was at work.

In later years, she was seen outside in the garden alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=William J. |last= Kole |url=http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyNiZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5NTMxNDk1MiZ5cmlyeTdmNzE3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514045312/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyNiZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5NTMxNDk1MiZ5cmlyeTdmNzE3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY= |archivedate=14 May 2007 |title=Neighbors say they saw captive girl alone outside|publisher=NorthJersey.com|date=30 August 2006|accessdate=4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Přiklopil's business partner has said that Kampusch seemed relaxed and happy when she and Přiklopil called at his home to borrow a trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last = Leidig |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2335782,00.html |title=Kidnapper's friend says he met 'cheerful' Natascha |publisher=The Times |date=31 August 2006 |accessdate=2 September 2006 | location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227130950/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article623344.ece |archive-date=27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/wien/stories/133065|title=Die Erklärung von Ernst H. im Wortlaut (The explanation by Ernst Holzapfel in his wording)|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)]] (online)|date=30 August 2006 |accessdate=1 October 2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--important--&gt; After her eighteenth birthday, she was allowed to leave the house with Přiklopil, but her kidnapper threatened to kill her if she made any noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last= Leidig |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2337830,00.html|title=Natascha tells of abductor's violence and terrifying lies|publisher=The Times|date=1 September 2006|accessdate=2 September 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later took her on a skiing trip to a resort near Vienna for a few hours.

According to Kampusch's official statement after her escape, she and Přiklopil would get up early each morning to have breakfast together. Přiklopil gave her books, so she educated herself.&lt;!-- important: http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/:Fall-Kampusch-Verlies-Schule/569880.html --&gt; Later, when explaining that in general she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, "I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness. I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon on television and in the media. Thus you know how small it was.

=== Escape ===
The 18-year-old Kampusch reappeared on 23 August 2006. At 12:53&amp;nbsp;pm, when Kampusch was cleaning and vacuuming her kidnapper's [[BMW 850]]i automobile in the garden, Přiklopil got a call on his mobile phone.  Because of the vacuuming noise, he walked away to take the call. Kampusch left the vacuum cleaner running and ran away, unseen by Přiklopil, who, according to the caller, completed the phone call without any sign of being disturbed or distracted. Kampusch ran for some 200&amp;nbsp;metres through gardens and a street, jumping fences, and asking passers-by to call the police, but they paid her no attention. After about five minutes, she knocked on the window of a 71-year-old neighbour known as Inge T, saying, "I am Natascha Kampusch".&lt;ref name="elkins"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbour called the police, who arrived at 1:04&amp;nbsp;pm. Later, Kampusch was taken to the police station in the town of [[Deutsch-Wagram]].

Kampusch was identified by a [[scar]] on her body, by her passport (which was found in the room where she had been held), and by DNA tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Kampusch grew only {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} during her captivity.

Sabine Freudenberger, the first police officer to speak to Kampusch after her ordeal, said that she was astonished by her "intelligence, her [[vocabulary]]". After two years, Přiklopil had brought her books, newspapers and a radio, which she kept tuned mainly to [[Ö1 International|Ö1]], an [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] station that is known for promoting education and classical music. She also states that she constantly had a feeling that she lacked something: "a deficit. So I wanted to make that better and I tried to educate myself, to teach myself skills. I have learned to knit for example."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2345787,00.html Transcript: Natascha Kampusch TV interview]: '''Times Online'''. 6 September 2006.

Přiklopil, knowing that the police were after him, killed himself by jumping in front of a [[Vienna S-Bahn|suburban train]] near the [[Wien Nord]] station in [[Vienna]].

'''Wolfgang Přiklopil''' (14 May 1962 – 23 August 2006) was an [[Austria]]n communications technician of [[Czech people|Czech]] origin. Přiklopil was born to Karl and Waltraud Přiklopil, in [[Vienna]], and was an only child. His father, Karl, was a cognac salesman and his mother, Waltraud, a shoe saleswoman.&lt;ref name="GUARD1206"&gt;{{cite news|title=The silence of the lamb|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-2483706_2,00.html|accessdate=10 December 2006| location=London|author=Patrick Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Přiklopil worked for a time at [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] as a communications technician.

Evidence recovery was complicated by the fact that Přiklopil's only computer was a 1980s Commodore 64, which is incompatible with modern-day data recovery programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/austria/article/0,,1865500,00.html|title=Kidnapper's retro computer offers scant clues|author=Mark Oliver|date=5 September 2006|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried under the name "Karl Wendelberger" on 8 September 2006 in the Piplitz family grave plot{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} in the town of [[Laxenburg]], south of Vienna.

Přiklopil allegedly had a daughter with the sister of a business partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2303168/Natascha-Kampuschs-father-names-second-kidnapper-claims-police-covered-errors-search-daughter-explosive-new-book.html|title=Natascha Kampusch's father names a second kidnapper and claims police covered up errors in the search for his daughter in explosive new book|author=Allan Hall|date=3 April 2013|work=Daily Mail|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Kampusch escaped, Přiklopil was trying to procure false papers as a Czech citizen, in order to "begin a new life" with Kampusch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/crooked-nose-drove-kampusch-kidnapper-claims-his-best-friend-2044822.html Crooked nose drove Kampusch kidnapper claims his best friend], The Independent&lt;/ref&gt;

She suggests that people who use this term about her are disrespectful of her and do not allow her the right to describe and analyse the complex relationship she had with her kidnapper in her own words.

In 2009, Kampusch became the new face of [[animal rights]] group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] in Austria. In June, Kampusch wrote to [[Ilse Aigner]], agriculture minister in Germany where the campaign is based, demanding freedom for zoo animals, stating: "The animals would, if they could, flee as I did, because a life in captivity is a life full of deprivation. It is up to you whether social, intelligent and wonderful creatures are to be freed from their chains and cages where ruthless people keep them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1194077/Cellar-victim-Natascha-Kampusch-strip-animal-rights.html Cellar victim Natascha Kampusch may strip for animal rights], [[Daily Mail]], 19 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Vienna's public prosecutor stated that DNA tests and questioning of witnesses had led to theories being discounted that Přiklopil had an accomplice. Kampusch has also maintained that her captor acted alone.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 8 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After reportedly "hundreds of requests for an interview" with the teenager, "with media outlets offering vast sums of money", Kampusch was interviewed by Austrian public broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]. The interview was broadcast on 6 September 2006 with her approval.&lt;!-- Wednesday, 18:15 (UTC) and a copy by RTL Television: 19:15 (UTC) --&gt; ORF did not pay for its interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5313762.stm|title=Kidnap girl to give TV interview |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=4 September 2006|accessdate=4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said any proceeds from selling the interview to other channels would be forwarded to Kampusch. The interview was sold to more than 120 countries at a fee of 290 euros per minute. This money, estimated to some hundred thousand euros,&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.extradienst.at/jaos/page/main_heute.tmpl?article_id=18721&amp;offset=0&lt;/ref&gt; was to be donated to women in Africa and Mexico by Kampusch. Likewise she was planning projects to help these women.&lt;ref&gt;''Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung'': Natascha Kampusch - the interview, 7 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was enormous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1446532.ece|title=Natascha Kampusch: 400 interview requests — that was just the start|work=The Independent|date=11 September 2006|accessdate=11 September 2006|location=London|first=Alexandra|last=Buxton|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008134748/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1446532.ece|archivedate=8 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper ''[[Kronen Zeitung]]'' and news magazine ''[[NEWS (Austrian magazine)|NEWS]]'' also interviewed Kampusch. The interview was published on 6 September 2006. Both press interviews were given in return for a package including housing support, a long-term job offer, and help with her education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2574050|title=Kampusch spricht – am Boulevard|publisher=[[Der Standard|derStandard.at]] |date=6 September 2006|accessdate=8 September 2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revelations of mistakes in the interior ministry's investigation of her kidnapping came to light, as well as statements of a policeman which were repeatedly ignored in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On 16 June 2008, the newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' published an in-depth interview with Kampusch by Bojan Pancevski and [[Stefanie Marsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article4044283.ece?print=yes |title=Natascha Kampusch: from darkness to limelight |accessdate=16 June 2008 |last=Pancevski |first=Bojan |author2=Marsh, Stefanie |date=2 June 2008 |publisher=[[The Times|Times Online]] |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615175158/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article4044283.ece?print=yes |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2010, the British TV channel [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] broadcast an hour-long documentary about the case, including an exclusive interview with Kampusch:  ''Natascha: the Girl in the Cellar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Jane|title=Natascha: The girl in the Cellar, FIVE, 8pm|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-previews/natascha-the-girl-in-the-cellar-five-8pm-201922|accessdate=13 March 2017|work=the Daily Mirror|publisher=MGN Limited|date=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natascha: The Girl In The Cellar|url=http://www.documentarytube.com/videos/natascha-the-girl-in-the-cellar|website=DocumentaryTube|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Books ===
The book ''Girl in the Cellar: the Natascha Kampusch Story''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Girl-Cellar-Natascha-Kampusch-Story/dp/0340936487 |title=Girl in the Cellar |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Allan Hall and Michael Leidig appeared in November 2006, written in English. Kampusch's lawyer described the book as being both speculative and premature, and therefore planned to take legal action against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,451732,00.html Skandal-Buch über entführte Natascha erzürnt Familie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711143400/http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,451732,00.html |date=11 July 2007 }}, ''Der Spiegel,'' 30. November 2006. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with two journalists, Kampusch's mother Brigitta Sirny wrote a book about the ordeal, ''Verzweifelte Jahre'' ("Desperate Years"). Kampusch appeared at the initial presentation of the book in August 2007, but did not want to be photographed or interviewed. Sirny writes that she did not have much contact with Kampusch after the escape because Kampusch was shielded from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,499269,00.html "Natürlich verdiene ich daran"] ''Spiegel Online,'' 10 August 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kampusch wrote a book about her ordeal, ''3096 Tage'' (''3,096 Days''), published in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/entfuehrungsfall-kampusch-schreibt-autobiografie_aid_522314.html Entführungsfall: Kampusch schreibt Autobiografie] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted into a German movie, ''[[3096]]'', in 2013.

On 12 August 2016 Natascha Kampusch released her second book titled ''10 Years of Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kampusch|first1=Natascha|title=10 Jahre Freiheit" {{!}} Natascha Kampusch|url=http://natascha-kampusch.at/das-neue-buch-von-natascha-kampusch-10-jahre-freiheit/|website=natascha-kampusch.at|accessdate=13 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Saying No to defeat is the only way to survive" – Interview with Natascha Kampusch|url=http://www.moonproject.co.uk/saying-no-to-defeat-is-the-only-way-to-survive-interview-with-natascha-kampusch/|website=MoonProject|accessdate=13 March 2017|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media endeavors ===
Kampusch established her own website containing personal information including pictures of herself on 5 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natascha-kampusch.at/|title=Natascha Kampusch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had her own talk show on the new Austria TV channel, PULS 4,&lt;!--http://www.puls4.com--&gt; starting on 1 June 2008&lt;!--http://www.kurier.at/kultur/163008.php--&gt;. The show had the working title of ''In Conversation with…Natascha Kampusch'' and eventually premiered as ''Natascha Kampusch trifft'' (''Natascha Kampusch meets...'').&lt;ref name="tvshow"&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/programming/a81588/kidnapped-austrian-girl-to-host-own-show.html Kidnapped Austrian girl to host own show] Digital Spy, 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/medien/380538/index.do |title=DiePresse.com |publisher=DiePresse.com |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for only three shows.

On 17 June 2010, German film-maker and director [[Bernd Eichinger]] announced that he was making a film based on Kampusch's captivity and wanted [[Kate Winslet]] to star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/17/kate-winslet-natascha-kampusch | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Natascha Kampusch film director eyes Kate Winslet as lead | first=Xan | last=Brooks | date=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernd Eichinger died on 24 January 2011; Kampusch attended his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German filmmaker Bernd Eichinger dies at 61|work=Reuters|date=25 January 2011|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/25/us-eichinger-idUSTRE70O7W420110125|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Austrian film ''[[Michael (2011 Austrian film)|Michael]]'', which has a plot that resembles the Natascha Kampusch case, was released.

On 15 April 2012, a German newspaper reported that a movie based on her autobiography with the same name was to be made, featuring [[Antonia Campbell-Hughes]] as Kampusch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film review: Natascha Kampusch’s eight years in captivity – distilled into 111 minutes of cinematic brutality in 3096 Days|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=March 2015|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/film-review-natascha-kampuschs-eight-years-in-captivity--distilled-into-111-minutes-of-cinematic-brutality-in-3096-days-8517557.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thure Lindhardt]] as Přiklopil. The movie ''3096 Tage'' (3096 days&lt;!--http://www.3096tage.de --&gt;) was directed by [[Sherry Hormann]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flower|first=Alex|title=N.Irish actress to play Natascha Kampusch in movie: report|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Natascha+Kampusch/articles/NV7dX5IdzuH/N+Irish+actress+play+Natascha+Kampusch+movie|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210024628/http://www.zimbio.com/Natascha+Kampusch/articles/NV7dX5IdzuH/N+Irish+actress+play+Natascha+Kampusch+movie|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 February 2013|accessdate=16 December 2012|newspaper=[[Zimbio]]|date=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Story of kidnap victim Natascha Kampusch set to be turned into film – with unknown Irish actress in lead role|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2130980/Story-kidnap-victim-Natascha-Kampusch-set-turned-film-called-3-096--Northern-Irish-actress-Antonia-Campbell-Hughes-lead-role.html|accessdate=16 December 2012|newspaper=Mail Online|date=17 April 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on 28 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Natascha Kampusch im Interview mit BILD – Zum 1.

=== House ===
[[File:Das Haus von Wolfgang Priklopil.jpg|thumb|Wolfgang Přiklopil's house in [[Strasshof]]]]
The house where Kampusch was imprisoned was built by Přiklopil's grandfather, Oskar Přiklopil, after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="GUARD1206"/&gt; During the [[Cold War]] period, Oskar and his son Karl built a [[Air-raid shelter|bomb shelter]], thought to be the origin of Kampusch's dungeon.  Přiklopil took over the house in 1984 following his grandmother's death.

Kampusch now owns the house in which she was imprisoned, saying, "I know it's grotesque – I must now pay for electricity, water and taxes on a house I never wanted to live in". It was reported that she claimed the house from Přiklopil's estate because she wanted to protect it from vandals and being torn down; she also noted that she has visited it since her escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1316125,00.html|title=Kidnap Victim Owns Her House of Horrors|publisher=Sky News|date=15 May 2008|accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the third anniversary of her escape approached, it was revealed she had become a regular visitor at the property and was cleaning it out possibly to move in herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |title=Kampusch to auction off horror house items – Panorama – Austrian Times |work= |accessdate=15 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/688Ynv8tb?url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |archivedate=3 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Kampusch said she had retained the house because it was such a big part of her formative years, also stating that she would fill in the cellar if it is ever sold, adamant that it will never become a macabre museum to her lost adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1245899/Natascha-Kampusch-If-I-sell-house-I-held-captive-half-years-I-make-sure-cellar-filled-in.html Natascha Kampusch: He put me inside the cellar for eight-and-a-half years, preserved alive like an Egyptian pharaoh], ''Daily Mail''. Retrieved 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The cellar was indeed filled in, though Kampusch still owns the house.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAxRCnoa9Aw Abductee Natascha Kampusch speaks out about her 8 years in captivity], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

{{New Netherland}}

The council of '''Nine Men''' was a citizens board and a form of representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous councils, the [[Twelve Men]] and the [[Eight Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council were elected in 1647, 1649, 1650 and 1652. On July 26, 1649, eleven current and former members of the board signed the ''Petition of the Commonality of New Netherland'', which requested that the States General take action to encourage [[economic freedom]] and force local government like that in the Netherlands, removing the colony from the control of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. It became the basis for the municipal government when the city of [[New Amsterdam]] received its charter in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = About the City Council   | publisher = New York City Council   | date =    | url = http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | accessdate = 2013-01-01   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120620053608/http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | archivedate = 2012-06-20   | df =    }} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
jones has been an activist for social change since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ar-conference"&gt;{{cite web|title=pattrice jones - International Animal Rights Conference|url=http://www.ar-conference.com/2013/pattrice_jones.php|website=International Animal Rights Conference|accessdate=June 13, 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="real-interview " /&gt; She stopped eating meat when she was 15, the same year that she came out as a [[lesbian]]. She later became [[vegan]], as she felt cows and hens were being sexually exploited for their milk and eggs.&lt;ref name="real-interview " /&gt;

In the year 2000, jones and her partner Miriam Jones founded Eastern Shore Sanctuary in rural [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="talking-animals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="real-interview " /&gt; The sanctuary was relocated to Vermont in 2009, and later renamed to VINE ("Veganism Is the Next Evolution") Sanctuary.&lt;ref name="talking-animals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="about-vine" /&gt;

Around 2002–2003, jones was attributed to be the main organiser&lt;ref name="pjones_led_GHA" /&gt; of the ''Global Hunger Alliance'' (GHA), an international network of several activist organisations that was coordinated in preparation for the [[World Food Summit#2002 World Food Summit|2002 World Food Summit]].&lt;ref name="GHA_about_201108" /&gt; The GHA networked with 90 other "supportive" organisations from around the world,&lt;ref name="AHershaft" /&gt; including [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]] and [[Uncaged Campaigns]].&lt;ref name="GHA_partners_URLs" /&gt;

In 2012, jones became involved in a battle over the lives of Bill and Lou, two [[oxen]] at [[Green Mountain College]] in [[Poultney, Vermont]]. After one of the oxen, Lou, became injured, the school decided to slaughter both and serve them as food in the dining hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bidgood|first1=Jess|title=Oxen's Fate Is Embattled as the Abattoir Awaits|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/us/oxens-possible-slaughter-prompts-fight-in-vermont.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 14, 2016|date=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students and animal rights advocates protested, and jones offered the oxen a home at VINE Sanctuary. The college ultimately euthanized Lou. The [[Green Mountain College#Oxen-slaughtering controversy|controversy]] made national headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bidgood|first1=Jess|title=A Casualty Amid Battle to Save College Oxen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/us/vermont-college-euthanizes-one-ox-spares-another.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 13, 2016|date=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; jones wrote about the events in her book, ''The Oxen at the Intersection.''&lt;ref name="real-interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="talking-animals" /&gt;

== Writing and lecturing ==

jones writes and lectures about animal rights from an [[intersectional]] approach,&lt;ref name="ar-conference" /&gt; connecting [[speciesism]] with [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], and [[transphobia]].&lt;ref name="autostraddle"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jamie|title=Queering the Politics of Animal Rights with VINE Sanctuary|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/queering-the-politics-of-animal-rights-with-vine-sanctuary-194804/|website=[[Autostraddle]]|accessdate=June 13, 2016|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Polybiography''' is the use of [[Email archiving|archived internet email services]] such as ListServs and WWWeb to publish historical information by those involved in the history. The historical web site and ListServ provide for formal historical articles, images, photographs, commentary, and discussion of those items in a process called a "polybiography"... the history by many of the many events.  The site is designed to be a [[Digital library#Searching|searchable repository]] of "raw material" for those with an interest in the history of [[Diagnostic Medical Sonography]] ([[ultrasonography]]).

This Internet based [[archive|historical archive]] has been referred to as a "polybiography" because it is both [[biographical]] and [[autobiographical]]; the many individuals involved write the history of the many events discussed. The resulting [[archive]] is expected to be similar to an [[oral history]] where an editor records and transcribes the various stories into a cohesive narrative. However, the oral history will have a slant due to the selection of participants and how they are edited. The polybiography will avoid a bias or slant from an editor because the participants are [[self-selected]]. The stories will be in the unedited words of the individuals who made the history. The primary problem anticipated will be the differences in individuals' writing styles, and a possibly confused organization.

The polybiography is uniquely adapted to the Internet and would be virtually impossible without the Internet. Without the global connections it would be difficult to locate all the individuals who contributed to the development of historical events. By the use of the Internet anyone who has a story to tell about the developments will be able to add to the history. This will allow those who were assistants to contribute, as well as the luminaries; where as with the traditional oral history, the editor might not locate some relatively minor, relocated participants.

The concept of the "polybiography" was first presented at the Annual Conference 2000 of the American Association of History &amp; Computing in [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION, COMMUNITY, AND VALUES, http://bcis.pacificu.edu/journal/2002/04/dubose.php, accessed November 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DuBose TJ; "A Poly-Autobiography of Sonography"; Proceedings [[American Association of History &amp; Computing]], Waco, Texas April 13–15, 2000. http://www.theaahc.org/, last access: February 21, 2001 http://www.theaahc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The original article was titled "Poly-autobiography of [[Diagnostic Medical Sonography]]",&lt;ref&gt;SDMS &amp; OBGYN.net; Ultrasound-History Forum &amp; Archives: http://forums.obgyn.net/ultrasound-history/; last access: February 21, 2001
&lt;/ref&gt; but during the discussion following the presentation it was suggested that, while the concept was thought to be a unique use of the Internet and WWWeb, the term "polybiography" would be more appropriate, more descriptive, and simpler.

[[File:Presidential Standard of Pakistan (1956-1967).svg|thumb|right|200px|Presidential Standard (1956-1967)]]

The '''Presidential Standard of Pakistan''' is the official flag of the [[President of Pakistan]].

== Design ==

The Presidential Standard consists of the background of the [[Flag of Pakistan]] with the gold Presidential Crest replacing the white crescent and star found in the Flag of Pakistan. The Presidential Crest consists of a smaller crescent and star flanked by wheat branches with the words "Pakistan" written in Urdu underneath.

== Use ==

The Presidential Standard is displayed only in the presence of the President of Pakistan, particularly in the office and official residence of the President of Pakistan. It is always displayed alongside the Flag of Pakistan. It is also flown alongside the Flag of Pakistan in the Presidential motorcade. The Presidential Standard is never flown atop any building.

== History ==

The Presidential Standard was first adopted in 1956 and has since been redesigned twice: in 1974 and 1998.

'''Qutalmish''' ({{lang-1ca|قُتَلمِش}}, {{lang-fa|قتلمش}}) (alternative spellings: '''Qutulmush''', '''Kutalmish''', {{lang|tr|'''Kutalmış'''}}) was a Turkic prince who was a member of Seljukid house in the 11th century. His son [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Kutalmışoglu Suleiman]], founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in what is now Turkey.

==Sultanate of Rûm==
Kutalmish was the son of [[Arslan Yabgu]] and a cousin of [[Tughril]] and played a vital role in the conquests of the [[Seljuq Turks]]. In 1046, he was sent with an army by Tughril to force back the Byzantine army at Ganja and was victorious.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker, ''The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna'', (Greenwood Publishing, 2000), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He supported a rebellion against Tughril and contested the succession to the throne with [[Alp Arslan]]. (''see'' [[Battle of Damghan (1063)]]) According to the historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], Kutalmish knew the sciences of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Institutionalisation of Science in the Medreses of pre-Ottoman and Ottoman Turkey'', Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, '''Turkish Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science''', Ed.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Great Britain (1714-1801).svg|thumb|The Royal Arms of Great Britain from 1714 to 1801, with crest, supporters and motto]]

The '''Royal coat of arms of Great Britain''' was the [[coat of arms]] representing royal authority in the sovereign state of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], in existence from 1707 to 1801. The kingdom came into being on 1 May 1707, with the [[political union]] of the [[kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[kingdom of England]], which included [[Wales]]. With the 1706 [[Treaty of Union]] (ratified by the [[Acts of Union 1707]]), it was agreed to create a single kingdom, encompassing the whole of the island of Great Britain and its outlying islands, but not Ireland, which remained a separate realm under the newly created British crown.

On 1 January 1801, the royal arms of Great Britain were superseded by those of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], when Great Britain was united with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] by the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union of 1800]] following the suppression of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Scaea''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Σκαιήν means "left, on the left hand"), was one of the [[Daughters of Danaus|Danaids]].

==Family==
Scaea was the daughter of [[Danaus]], king of [[Libya]] and of [[Europa (Greek myth)|Europe]], a queen. She was the full sister of other Danaids namely Automate, [[Amymone]] and [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''Bibliotheca, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.1.5&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 Book 2.1.5]''&lt;/ref&gt; Scaea was married to [[Daiphron]], son of [[Aegyptus]] and later to [[Archander]] of whom she had begotten a son, [[Metanastes]].

==Mythology==
Scaea like her other sisters, except [[Hypermnestra]], killed their husbands on their wedding night at the behest of their father Danaus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the murder, later on, Scaea and her sisters were punished in afterlife, being forced to carry a jug to fill a bathtub (pithos) without a bottom (or with a leak) to wash their sins off. The water was always leaking that they would forever try to fill the tub.

In some accounts, Scaea remarried Archander while her sister Automate took as husband his brother [[Architeles]]. These two were sons of [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]], coming from [[Phthiotis]] to settle in [[Argos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

[[File:Roma, repubblica, moneta di p. satrienus, 77 ac..JPG|thumb|350px|The she-wolf on a coin of the late Roman republic (c.77 BC)]]
In the [[Founding of Rome|Roman foundation myth]], it was a '''she-wolf''' that nursed and sheltered the twins [[Romulus and Remus]] after they were abandoned in the wild by order of [[Amulius|King Amulius]] of [[Alba Longa]]. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the [[Lupercal]], until they were discovered by a shepherd, [[Faustulus]]. [[Romulus]] would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of [[Rome]] since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Wiseman ''Remus'' preface pg xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy.  One legend claims that the [[Hirpini]] people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony,  they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: ''hirpus'').&lt;ref&gt; Strabo Book V Ch.12 (''Loeb'' pg.467) &lt;/ref&gt;  The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the wolf is a sacred animal.  There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the [[Lupercalia]].

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Apollo]]'s mother [[Leto]] is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Aristotle]]|accessdate=5 December 2016|title=History of Animals|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL438.345.xml?rskey=9mJ3UR&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=S0vjOz|doi=10.4159/DLCL.aristotle-history_animals.1965}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sources==
The 3 "canonical" versions of the myth--those of [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]--all draw heavily on [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I 79&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins.  The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius.  Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding.  Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of [[Palatine Hill]].  The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water.  In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal.  Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.

Dionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further.  The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud.  The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.

After a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Greek colonists]] who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I ch.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness.  The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what.  The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land.  The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.&lt;ref&gt; Livy I pp.17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch.  After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away.  It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.99&lt;/ref&gt;

The three relay accounts wherein the term "lupa" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute.  Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment.  In one, the twins are fathered by [[Hercules]] after he wins a dice game.  Their mother is the unwitting "prize".  In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby [[Gabii]].&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Scan of Figurehead from Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums band 1 (1776).png|thumb|right|Figurehead from the title page of ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums''  Vol. 1 (1776) by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]].  Winckelmann was a pioneer in the study of Graeco-Roman art and [[ancient Roman art]] in particular.  He is center, with the she-wolf suckling the twins and [[Homer]] closest to him.  The [[Sphinx]] and an [[Etruscan art|Etruscan vase]] are in the background.]]

===Earliest representation===
The "Bolsena Mirror" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures.  Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features.&lt;ref&gt; Mazzoni pp173-178&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes its age.  However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340.  The famous [[Capitoline Wolf]] may be of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] or [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Old Latin]] origin.&lt;ref&gt; Tennant p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and [[radiocarbon dating]] has cast doubt on an ancient origin.&lt;ref name="laregina2006"&gt;Adriano La Regina,"[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma.html ''Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è "nata" nel Medioevo]'' "Rome: the phony She-Wolf wasn't born until the Middle-ages" La Republica. 17 November 2006, accessed 1 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[stele]] from [[Bologna]], dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant.  By 269 BC, the silver [[drachm|didrachm]] is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic "turning of the she-wolf's head" backward and downward at the twins.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], the patron deity of the city, or the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]].  That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces.  She and the twins were featured on the elaborate [[Ara Pacis]], built in honor of [[Augustus]] and dedicated to [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]], the goddess of peace.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.336-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated.  They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own "Roman-ness".&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.339&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.343-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early middle ages===
The [[Franks Casket]], an ornately carved, [[Anglo-Saxon]] chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a [[Rune|Runic]] account of the lupercal.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.356 fn.148&lt;/ref&gt; Other Anglo-Saxon [[Undley bracteate|artifacts]] and coins from the same period also feature them.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.357&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Byzantine]]s continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in [[central Asia]] at sites located in modern [[Tadjikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] along with an 8th-century [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.&lt;ref&gt;Compareti p.304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siena She-Wolf===
The [[Siena|Sienese]] have a traditional tale that the city was founded by [[Senius and Aschius]], another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf.  They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus.  The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance.  However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.

==Lupercalia==
The [[Lupercalia]] was a very ancient festival even during Roman times.  Roman historians speculated as to its origins.  It may be associated with the god [[Lupercus]], the god of [[Pastoralism|shepherds]] and protector of flocks.  Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">The '''Syndicate of Seven''' is the name given to the original members of the Broken Hill Mining Company formed in 1883, who lodged applications for mining leases along the Line of Lode at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

The members, who all worked at the remote [[Mount Gipps Station|Mount Gipps]] [[Sheep station]], were:-

#[[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]] (1848 – 1907) – station manager.
#[[Charles Rasp]] (1846 – 1907) – a [[boundary rider]], who was interested in [[prospecting]], recognised the importance of the site and pegged out the first mining lease.
#Philip Charley (1863 – 1937) – a young man learning to be a sheep farmer, employed as a [[boundary rider]].
#David James (1854 – 1926) – a contractor employed to sink water tanks and mend fences.
#James Poole (1848 – 1924) – an employee of David James.
#George Urquhart (1845 – 1915) – a bookkeeper and overseer
#George Lind (1861 – 1941) – a storekeeper.

[[Image:Philip Charley thumb.jpg|right|Philip Charley in 1887]]

"Each of the above seven contributing the sum of £70 each".

(Curtis 1908, and Camilleri 2006).

In September 1883 they pegged seven {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} blocks (blocks No 10–16) along the exposed lode at Broken Hill, thus securing almost the whole of the easily worked ore (Curtis, 1908).

The Syndicate of Seven was masterminded by [[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]] (Camilleri, p17, 2006).

The initial assay results were not encouraging and Poole, Urquhart and Lind sold their share before the boom days and flotation of Broken Hill Proprietary in 1885 (Curtis, 1908 and Camilleri, 2006). James Poole sold half his share to [[Sidney Kidman]] who went on to become a wealthy cattle baron and landowner.

'''The Bowery Boys''' are fictional [[New York City]] characters, portrayed by a [[repertory theater|company]] of New York actors, who were the subject of feature films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1946 through 1958.

The Bowery Boys were successors of the "[[East Side Kids]]," who had been the subject of films since 1940. The group originated as the "[[Dead End Kids]]", who originally appeared in the 1937 film ''[[Dead End (1937 film)|Dead End]].'' A few of the actors previously appeared together as "[[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]]."

==Origins==

===The Dead End Kids===
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
"The Dead End Kids" originally appeared in the 1935 play ''Dead End,'' dramatized by [[Sidney Kingsley]]. When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play into a [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film]], he recruited the original "kids" from the play—[[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]—to appear in the same roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films that shared the collective title "The Dead End Kids".

===The Little Tough Guys===
{{main|Little Tough Guys}}
In 1938, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] launched its own tough-kid series, "[[Little Tough Guys]]." Gradually, Universal recruited most of the original Dead End Kids, so the series ultimately featured "[[The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys]]." Universal made twelve feature films, and three 12-chapter serials with the gang. The final film in Universal's series, ''[[Keep 'Em Slugging]],'' was released in 1943, with [[Bobby Jordan]] replacing erstwhile ringleader [[Billy Halop]].

===The East Side Kids===
{{main|East Side Kids}}
When Warner Brothers released the remaining Dead End Kids from their contracts in 1939, producer [[Sam Katzman]] at Monogram acted quickly and hired several of them, including Jordan and the Gorcey brothers, Leo and David, as well as some of the Little Tough Guys, including Hally Chester, to star in a new series using the team name "The East Side Kids."  These films also introduced [[Sammy Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]], one of the original members of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team, as part of the gang.

The original members of the "Dead End Kids" were now working at several studios, so these films were made at the same time that Universal was making "The Dead End Kids" and "Little Tough Guys" series. A total of 21 films were made, with the final one, ''Come Out Fighting'', released in 1945.

==The Bowery Boys==

In 1945, when East Side Kids producer Katzman refused to grant Leo Gorcey's request to double his weekly salary, Gorcey quit the series, which then ended immediately. Bobby Jordan then suggested a meeting with his agent, Jan Grippo. Grippo, Gorcey, and Hall formed Jan Grippo Productions, revamped the format, and rechristened the series ''The Bowery Boys.'' (The earlier films's credits appear as "Leo Gorcey ''and'' The Bowery Boys".) Gorcey, who owned 40 percent of the company, starred, produced, and contributed to the scripts. The new series followed a more established formula than the prior incarnations of the team, with the gang usually hanging out at Louie's Sweet Shop (at 3rd &amp; Canal St.) until an adventure came along.

The original main characters were Terrence Aloysius "Slip" Mahoney ([[Leo Gorcey]]), Horace Debussy "Sach" Jones ([[Huntz Hall]]), Bobby ([[Bobby Jordan]]), Whitey ([[William "Billy" Benedict|Billy Benedict]]), and Chuck ([[David Gorcey]], sometimes billed as David Condon). [[Ernest Morrison|"Sunshine" Sammy Morrison]], "Scruno" in the East Side Kids films, declined the invitation to rejoin the gang. (He later stated in an interview that he "didn't like the setup", possibly referring to the idea of Gorcey and Hall being in the forefront, and being paid much more than the other members.) When Bobby Jordan quit the series for the same reason, his character was replaced by Butch Williams, with former East Side Kids [[Bennie Bartlett]] and [[Buddy Gorman]] alternating in the role. The proprietor of the malt shop where they hung out was the panicky Louie Dumbrowski ([[Bernard Gorcey]], Leo's and David's real-life father).

Like the previous incarnations of the team, the members went through a number of changes over the course of the series. Thirteen actors were members of the team at one time or another. Bobby Jordan, an original Dead End Kid, appeared in the first eight films, but left after being injured in an elevator accident. Jordan was also unhappy with the direction of the series, which favored Gorcey and Hall, and limited the participation of the other gang members.

[[Gabriel Dell]] returned in the fourth entry, ''[[Spook Busters]]'' (1946), as "Gabe Moreno," a former member of the gang just out of the Navy with a French war-bride in tow. He remained (minus spouse) for the next 16 features. Gabe was a convenient "utility" character, frequently changing jobs (private investigator, policeman, songwriter, reporter, Nazi spy) to suit the story at hand—and the limited casting budget. Dell often acted as a bridge between the real world and those of the Boys who he would summon to assist him. He reprised one of his East Side Kids roles in ''[[Hard Boiled Mahoney]]'' (1947), playing Gabe as a myopic nerd with thick glasses, ascot and cap. His final appearance was in ''[[Blues Busters (1950 film)|Blues Busters]]'' in 1950, generally regarded as one of the funniest in the series.

The early films such as ''[[In Fast Company]]'' (1946) flirted with the same humor-laced crime drama of the previous series, but they gradually shifted to all-out comedy, growing more slapstick and fantasy-oriented over the next decade. After 1950, the series began to resemble the farcical [[Abbott and Costello]] comedies—a far cry from the grim social realism of their 1930s films. The grittiness of the old days was sanitized with the gang's dingy basement club-house replaced by an ice cream parlor. The "boys" also adopted a more adult look, exchanging their sloppy, juvenile wardrobe for suits.

The team spirit of the ensemble cast faded as Huntz Hall was elevated to co-star status to showcase his comedic skills. The stories now focused entirely on Slip (the self-proclaimed leader of the bunch) and his zany sidekick, Sach, with the diminished three or four "boys" receding into the background with little to do. Time and again the plot revolved around Sach accidentally acquiring some strange power or ability (he becomes a psychic, champion wrestler, crooner, etc.) that Slip is quick to exploit. In most of the films, the gang pursues a scheme for quick riches or gets mixed up with neighborhood thugs. Story elements from their earlier films (haunted houses, mad scientists, nefarious spies) were also frequently incorporated into the new series.

Like a streetwise [[Abbott and Costello]], Gorcey and Hall became a cohesive comedy duo, extending their verbal and physical humor into broader slapstick comedy that served to increase the popularity of the series.  In 1953, [[Edward Bernds]], a new producer and director who had previously worked with [[The Three Stooges]], transformed the series into lucrative kiddie-matinée fodder, with Gorcey and Hall re-enacting gags borrowed from the Stooges. (Huntz Hall cited [[Shemp Howard]], who had appeared in three Little Tough Guys films, as a major influence during this latter phase in the series.)

Leo's character "Slip" was famed for his [[malaprop]]s (always delivered in a [[Brooklyn accent]]), such as "a clever seduction" for "a clever deduction," "I depreciate it!" ("I appreciate it!"), and "I regurgitate" ("I reiterate").

In the 1940s, [[Abbott and Costello]] appeared in a quartet of "service comedies", one for each branch of the military. The Bowery Boys duplicated this feat a decade later with ''[[Bowery Battalion]],'' ''[[Let's Go Navy!]],'' ''[[Here Come the Marines]],'' and ''[[Clipped Wings (1953 film)|Clipped Wings]].'' Abbott and Costello spoofed westerns: ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942 film)|Ride 'Em Cowboy]]'' (1942), the upper-classes: ''[[In Society]]'' (1944), and hillbillies: ''[[Comin' Round the Mountain]]'' (1951). The Bowery Boys repeated this formula in ''[[Bowery Buckaroos]]'' (1947), ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955), and ''[[Feudin' Fools]]'' (1952), respectively.

Abbott and Costello went on safari: ''[[Africa Screams]]'' (1949), to the Middle East: ''[[Lost in a Harem]]'' (1944), and even tangled with pirates in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd]]'' (1952). Once again, the Bowery Boys followed suit with ''[[Jungle Gents]]'' (1954), ''[[Bowery to Bagdad]]'' (1955), and ''[[Hold That Hypnotist]]'' (1957). Abbott and Costello become private detectives in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man]]'' (1951); the Bowery Boys open up a detective agency in 1953's ''Private Eyes''.

After Abbott and Costello's haunted-house comedy ''[[Hold That Ghost]]'' (1941) became a smash hit, the East Side Kids released the similar ''Spooks Run Wild'' with Bela Lugosi later that year. Lugosi went on to help make ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]],'' one of A&amp;C's most popular and critically acclaimed comedies. The basic premise, centered around Dracula's scheme to transplant Costello's brain into the Frankenstein monster (played by [[Glenn Strange]]), was duplicated a few months later by The Bowery Boys in ''[[Master Minds]]'' (1949). Glenn Strange once again plays a hulking monster who switches minds with Sach (Huntz Hall). With a title suggesting a send-up of the Abbott and Costello "Meet" films, ''[[The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters]]'' (1954) was the highest grossing entry in the series.

After filming ''[[Dig That Uranium]]'' in 1955, Bernard Gorcey was killed in an automobile accident, devastating his son Leo, who began to drink heavily, and it visibly affected his performance in the following film, ''Crashing Las Vegas'', which was his last. (During filming, he became violently unhinged, trashing the set and destroying every prop in sight.{{cn|date=December 2017}}) At a subsequent meeting with Allied Artists, Gorcey demanded an increase on the 40% interest he held in the series. This was denied, and after a heated exchange, he quit the series and stormed off the studio lot.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The studio owed exhibitors three more films for the 1956 season, so Gorcey was replaced by [[Stanley Clements]], a former tough-teen actor who had been in a few East Side Kids movies. Clements, as "Duke Coveleskie," adapted to the series easily and completed the three films, which now starred "Huntz Hall and The Bowery Boys." The new Hall-Clements partnership was successful enough to be renewed for the 1957 season. Four more films were made, with Eddie LeRoy joining the cast as bespectacled "Blinky." With Bernard Gorcey gone, Louie's Sweet Shop was replaced by Clancy's Cafe with a similarly put-upon proprietor, "Mike" ([[Percy Helton]], later played by [[Dick Elliott]]).

==Legacy==

In all, there were 48 Bowery Boys films, making it the longest feature-film series of American origin in motion picture history (only the Mexican ''[[El Santo|Santo]]'' film series ran longer), with the final film, ''[[In the Money]],'' being released in 1958. Only Huntz Hall and David Gorcey had remained with the series since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;''Me and the Dead End Kid,'' Leo Gorcey, Jr., Spirit of Hope Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowery Boys and East Side Kids picked up a new generation of mostly younger fans when the films were repackaged and syndicated for television in the 1960s and 1970s. They became a staple for independent stations across the U.S., often used to fill up the early-afternoon time-slots on weekends.

'''The Five''', also known as the '''Mighty Handful''' and the '''New Russian School''', were five prominent 19th-century Russian [[composers]] who worked together to create distinct [[Russian classical music]]. [[Mily Balakirev]] (the leader), [[César Cui]], [[Modest Mussorgsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Borodin]] all lived in [[Saint Petersburg]], and collaborated from 1856 to 1870.

==History==

===Name===
[[Image:Vladimir Stasov.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Stasov]] &lt;br&gt; (1824&amp;ndash;1906)]]
In May 1867 the critic [[Vladimir Stasov]] wrote an article, titled ''Mr. Balakirev's Slavic Concert'', covering a concert that had been performed for visiting Slav delegations at the "All-Russian Ethnographical Exhibition" in Moscow. The four Russian composers whose works were played at the concert were [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], [[Mily Balakirev]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''Essays on Russian and East European Music: Vladimir Stasov, Man and Critic'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The article ended with the following statement:

{{quote|God grant that our Slav guests may never forget today's concert; God grant that they may forever preserve the memory of how much poetry, feeling, talent, and intelligence are possessed by the small but already mighty handful of Russian musicians.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"&gt;Calvocoressi, M.D., Abraham, G., ''Master Musicians Series: Mussorgsky'', London: J.M.Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1946, pg. 178&lt;/ref&gt;|Vladimir Stasov|''[[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti]], 1867''}}

The expression "mighty handful" ({{lang-ru|Могучая кучка}}, ''Moguchaya kuchka'', "Mighty Bunch") was mocked by enemies of Balakirev and Stasov: [[Alexander Serov|Aleksandr Serov]], academic circles of the conservatory, the Russian Musical Society, and their press supporters. The group ignored critics and continued operating under the moniker.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"/&gt; This loose collection of composers gathered around Balakirev now included Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Borodin &amp;mdash; the five who have come to be associated with the name "Mighty Handful", or sometimes "The Five". [[Gerald Abraham]] stated flatly in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' that "they never called themselves, nor were they ever called in Russia, 'The Five'"&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''The New Grove: Russian Masters 1: Balakirev'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1986, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; (although today the Russian equivalent "Пятёрка" ("Pyatyorka") is occasionally used to refer to this group).&lt;ref&gt;''Krugosvet'', "[http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/muzyka/BALAKIREV_MILI_ALEKSEEVICH.html Balakirev Mily Alekseevich]".&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Rimsky-Korsakov routinely refers to the group as "Balakirev's circle", and occasionally uses "The Mighty Handful", usually with an ironic tone. He also makes the following reference to "The Five":

{{quote|If we leave out of account [[Nikolai Lodyzhensky|Lodyzhensky]], who accomplished nothing, and [[Anatoly Lyadov|Lyadov]], who appeared later, Balakirev's circle consisted of Balakirev, Cui, Mussorgsky, Borodin, and me (the French have retained the denomination of "''Les Cinq''" for us to this day).&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, N., ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', New York: Knopf, 1923, pg. 286&lt;/ref&gt;|Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov|''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', 1909}}

The Russian word ''kuchka'' also spawned the terms "kuchkism" and "kuchkist", which may be applied to artistic aims or works in tune with the sensibilities of the Mighty Handful.

The name of [[Les Six]], an even looser collection of French-speaking composers, emulates that of "The Five".

===Formation===
The formation of the group began in 1856, with the first meeting of Balakirev and [[César Cui]]. [[Modest Mussorgsky]] joined them in 1857, [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] in 1861, and [[Alexander Borodin]] in 1862. All the composers in The Five were young men in 1862. Balakirev was 25, Cui 27, Mussorgsky 23, Borodin the eldest at 28, and Rimsky-Korsakov just 18. They were all self-trained amateurs. Borodin combined composing with a career in [[chemistry]]. Rimsky-Korsakov was a [[Imperial Russian Navy|naval officer]] (he wrote his First Symphony on a three-year naval voyage circumnavigating the globe). Mussorgsky had been in the prestigious [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] of the Imperial Guard, and then in the civil service before taking up music; even at the height of his career in the 1870s he was forced by the expense of his drinking habit to hold down a full-time job in the State Forestry Department.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando, ''Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia'' (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2002), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the élite status and court connections of Conservatory composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], The Five were mainly from the minor gentry of the provinces. To some degree their ''[[esprit de corps]]'' depended on the myth, which they themselves created, of a movement that was more "authentically Russian," in the sense that it was closer to the native soil, than the classic academy.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 179. Also see R. Tarushkin, ''Defining Russia Musically'', xiii ff, per Figes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before them, [[Mikhail Glinka]] and [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]] had gone some way towards producing a distinctly Russian kind of music, writing operas on Russian subjects, but the Mighty Handful represented the first concentrated attempt to develop such a music, with Stasov as their artistic adviser and Dargomyzhsky as an elder statesman to the group, so to speak. The circle began to fall apart during the 1870s, no doubt partially due to the fact that Balakirev withdrew from musical life early in the decade for a period of time. All of "The Five" are buried in [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

==Musical language==

===Stylization===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
The musical language The Five developed set them far apart from the Conservatoire. This self-conscious Russian styling was based on two elements:

*They tried to incorporate in their music what they heard in village songs, in [[Cossack]] and [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] dances, in church chants and the tolling of church bells (to the point where the bell tolling became a cliché). The Five's music became filled with imitative sounds of Russian life. They also tried to reproduce the long-drawn, lyrical and [[melisma]]tic peasant song, what Glinka had once called "the soul of Russian music."  Balakirev made this possible by his study of songs from the Volga in the 1860s. More than any previous anthology, his transcriptions artfully preserved the distinctive aspects of Russian folk music:
**Tonal mutability
*:A tune seems to shift naturally from one [[tonal center]] to another, often ending up in a different key than the one in which the song began. This can produce a feeling of elusiveness, a lack of definition or of logical progression in the harmony. Even when stylized by The Five, this quality can make Russian music sound very different from the tonal structures of the West.
**[[Heterophony]]
*:A melody is simultaneously rendered by two or more performers in different variations. This is improvised by the singers until the end, when the song reverts to a single melodic line.
**[[consecutive fifth|Parallel fifth]]s, fourths and thirds
*:The effect lends Russian music a raw sonority missing entirely from the comparatively polished harmonies of Western music.
*The Five also adopted a series of harmonic devices to create a distinct "Russian" style and color different from Western music. This "exotic" styling of "Russia" was not just self-conscious but entirely invented. None of these devices was actually used in Russian folk or church music:
**[[Whole tone scale]]
*:Although Glinka did not invent this scale, his application of it in the opera ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842) &amp;mdash; most recognizable at the end of the festive overture &amp;mdash; provided a characteristic harmonic and melodic device. This scale in "Russian" works often suggests evil or ominous personages or situations. It was used by all the major composers from Tchaikovsky (the appearance of the Countess's ghost in ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'') to Rimsky-Korsakov (in all his magic-story operas—''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'', ''[[Kashchey the Deathless]]'' and ''[[The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya|The Invisible City of Kitezh]]''). [[Claude Debussy]] also uses this scale in his music, taking this, among many things, from the Russians. Later it became a standard device in horror-movie scores.
**The [[Russian submediant]]&lt;ref&gt;DeVoto, Mark. "The Russian Submediant in the Nineteenth Century," Current Musicology, no. 59 (October 1995), pp. 48&amp;ndash;76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*:Also linked to Glinka's  ''Ruslan'', this is a harmonic pattern (in  major mode) in which one upper part proceeds from the dominant pitch chromatically to the submediant while the other harmony parts remain constant. The most basic form of this pattern can be shown as follows (beginning with typical tonic):  root-position tonic triad → root-position augmented tonic triad → 1st inversion submediant minor triad. A famous example of the Russian submediant occurs in the very opening bars of the third movement of Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherezade]]''.
**[[Octatonic scale|Diminished or octatonic scale]]
*:Rimsky-Korsakov first used this in his symphonic poem ''Sadko'' in 1867. This scale became a sort of Russian calling-card &amp;mdash; a ''[[leitmotif]]'' of magic and menace used not just by Rimsky-Korsakov but all of his followers, above all [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] (mode 2).
**Modular rotation in sequences of thirds
*:The Five made this device of [[Franz Liszt]] their own to base a loose [[symphonic poem|symphonic-poem]] type of structure. This way, they could avoid the rigid Western laws of modulation in [[sonata form]], allowing the form of a musical composition to be shaped entirely by the "content" of the music (its programmatic statements and visual descriptions) rather than by formal laws of symmetry. This loose structure became especially important for Mussorgsky's ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', a work that may have done more than any other to define the Russian style.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 180&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Pentatonic scale]]
*:This stylistic aspect became used by every Russian nationalist composer.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinctive feature is to have only five notes in the octave, rather than the seven of the [[heptatonic scale]]s (e.g., [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]]). The pentatonic scale is one of the ways of suggesting a "primitive" folk-melodic style as well as the "Eastern" element (Middle East, Asia). A melodic example of the "major-mode" pentatonic scale (C-D-E-G-A) can be heard at the entrance of the chorus at the beginning of Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]''.

===Orientalism===
One hallmark of "The Five" was its reliance on [[orientalism]].&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Many quintessentially "Russian" works were composed in orientalist style, such as Balakirev's ''[[Islamey]]'', Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]''.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Orientalism, in fact, became widely considered in the West both one of the best-known aspects of Russian music and a trait of Russian national character.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; As leader of "The Five," Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their "Russian" music apart from the German symphonism of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and other Western-oriented composers.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Rimsky-Korsakov used Russian folk and oriental melodies in his [[Symphony No. 1 (Rimsky-Korsakov)|First Symphony]], Stasov and the other nationalists dubbed it the "First Russian Symphony," even though Rubinstein had written his ''Ocean'' Symphony a dozen years before it.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; These were themes Balakirev had transcribed in the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; "The symphony is good," Cui wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1863, while the latter was out on naval deployment. "We played it a few days ago at Balakirev's—to the great pleasure of Stassov. It is really Russian. Only a Russian could have composed it, because it lacks the slightest trace of any stagnant Germanness."&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, A.N., ''N.A. Rimskii-Korsakov: zhizn' i tvorchestvo'', vyp. 2 (Moscow, 1935), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orientalism was not confined to using authentic Eastern melodies.&lt;ref name="maes82"&gt;Maes, Francis, tr. Pomerans, Arnold J. and Erica Pomerans, ''A History of Russian Music: From ''Kamarinskaya ''to'' Babi Yar (Berkeley, Los Angeles and London: University of California Press, 2002), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; What became more important than the melodies themselves were the musical conventions added to them.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; These conventions allowed orientalism to become an avenue for writing music on subjects considered unmentionable otherwise, such as political themes and erotic fantasies.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; It also became a means of expressing Russian supremacy as the empire expanded under [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; This was often reinforced through [[Misogyny|misogynist]] symbolism—the rational, active and moral Western man versus the irrational, passive and immoral Eastern woman.&lt;ref name="maes80"/&gt;

Two major works entirely dominated by orientalism are Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite ''[[Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Antar]]'' and Balakirev's symphonic poem ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; ''Antar'', set in Arabia, uses two different styles of music, Western (Russian) and Eastern (Arabian).&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The first theme, Antar's, is masculine and Russian in character.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second theme, feminine and oriental in melodic contour, belongs to the queen, Gul Nazar.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov was able to soften the implicit misogyny to some extent.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; However, female sensuality does exert a paralyzing, ultimately destructive influence.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; With Gul Nazar extinguishing Antar's life in a final embrace, the woman overcomes the man.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt;

Balakirev gives a more overtly misogynistic view of oriental women in ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; He had originally planned to write a Caucasan dance called a ''lezginka'', modeled on Glinka, for this work.&lt;ref name="maes83"/&gt; However, he discovered a poem by [[Mikhail Lermontov]] about the beautiful Tamara, who lived in a tower alongside the gorge of Daryal.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; She lured travelers and allowed them to enjoy a night of sensual delights, only to kill them and throw their bodies into the River Terek.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Balakirev uses two specific codes endemic to orientalism in writing ''Tamara''. The first code, based on obsessive rhythms, note repetitions, climactic effects and accelerated tempi, represents Dionysian intoxication.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second code, consisting of unpredictable rhythms, irregular phrasing and based on long passages with many repeat notes, augmented and diminished [[interval (music)|intervals]] and extended [[melisma]]s, depict sensual longing.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Not only did Balakirev use these codes extensively, but he also attempted to supercharge them further when he revised the orchestration of ''Tamara'' in 1898.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct result of such orientalism was the big influence that this circle left on the formation of classical traditions in other nations of the east and south of Russia. For instance, one of Rimsky-Korsakov's famous students, [[Alexander Spendiaryan]] went on to become the founder of Armenian classical music, carrying on the traditions and aesthetics of the Mighty Handful to the Caucasus.

==Quotations==
[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] provides the following picture of "The Mighty Handful" in his memoirs, ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'' (translated by J. A. Joffe):

===Tastes===
{{quote|"The tastes of the circle leaned towards Glinka, Schumann, and Beethoven's last quartets ... they had little respect for Mendelssohn ... Mozart and Haydn were considered out of date and naive ... J. S. Bach was held to be petrified ... Chopin was likened by Balakirev to a nervous society lady ... Berlioz was highly esteemed ...Liszt was comparatively unknown ... Little was said of Wagner ... They respected Dargomyzhsky for the recitative portions of ''Rusalka'' ... [but] he was not credited with any considerable talent and was treated with a shade of derision. ...Rubinstein had a reputation as a pianist, but was thought to have neither talent nor taste as a composer."}}

===Balakirev===
{{quote|"Balakirev, who had never had any systematic course in harmony and counterpoint and had not even superficially applied himself to them, evidently thought such studies quite unnecessary ... An excellent pianist, a superior sight reader of music, a splendid improviser, endowed by nature with the sense of correct harmony and part-writing, he possessed a technique partly native and partly acquired through a vast musical erudition, with the help of an extraordinary memory, keen and retentive, which means so much in steering a critical course in musical literature ... He instantly felt every technical imperfection or error, he grasped a defect in form at once. Whenever I or other young men, later on, played him our essays at composition, he instantly caught all the defects of form, modulation, and so on, and forthwith seating himself at the piano, he would improvise and show how the composition in question should be changed exactly as he indicated, and frequently entire passages in other people's compositions became his and not their putative authors' at all. He was obeyed absolutely, for the spell of his personality was tremendous. ... His influence over those around him was boundless, and resembled some magnetic or mesmeric force. ... he despotically demanded that the tastes of his pupils should exactly coincide with his own. The slightest deviation from his taste was severely censured by him. By means of raillery, a parody or caricature played by him, whatever did not suit him at the moment was belittled — and the pupil blushed with shame for his expressed opinion and recanted...."}}

===Abilities===
{{quote|"Balakirev considered me a symphony specialist ... in the sixties, Balakirev and Cui, though very intimate with Mussorgsky and sincerely fond of him, treated him like a lesser light, and of little promise at that, in spite of his undoubted talent. It seemed to them that there was something missing in him and, in their eyes, he was in need of advice and criticism. Balakirev often said that Mussorgsky had 'no head' or that his 'brains were weak.' ... Balakirev thought that Cui understood little in symphony and musical forms and nothing in orchestration, but was a past master in vocal and operatic music; Cui, in turn, thought Balakirev a master in symphony, form, and orchestration, but with little liking for operatic composition and vocal music in general. Thus they complemented each other, but each, in his own way, felt mature and grown up. Borodin, Mussorgsky, and I, however &amp;mdash; we were immature and juvenile. Obviously, towards Balakirev and Cui we were in somewhat subordinate relations; their opinions were listened to unconditionally...."}}

==Influence==
Except perhaps for Cui, the members of this group influenced or taught many of the great Russian composers who were to follow, including [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. They also influenced the two French symbolist composers [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]] through their radical tonal language.

'''The Twelve Imams''' are the spiritual and political successors to the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] in the [[Twelver]] or ''Athnā‘ashariyyah'' branch of [[Shia Islam]], including that of the [[Alawite]] and the [[Alevi]] sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Olsson|Ozdalga|Raudvere|2005|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[theology of Twelvers]], also the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret ''[[sharia]]'' and the [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric meaning of the Quran]]. Muhammad and Imams' [[Sunnah|words and deeds]] are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ''[[ismah]]'', or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or ''[[Nass (Islam)|nass]]'', through the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabataba'i|1977|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Twelvers1 copy copy.png|thumb|Calligraphic representation of the Twelve Imams along with that of the Prophet Muhammad.]]
==The belief of Imamah==
{{main|Imamate (Twelver doctrine)}}
It is believed in [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]] that [[Aql (Shiasm)|‘aql]], divine wisdom, is the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called ''[[Hikmah]]'' and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabataba'i|1977|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbin|2014|pp=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Imam is not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he has a close relationship with [[Allah|God]], through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as [[Al-Jafr (book)|al-Jafr]] and [[al-Jamia]]. [[Imamate]], or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.&lt;ref name="Imamat"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam and the Muslim world; vol.1  | last = Gleave | first = Robert | title=Imamate | publisher = MacMillan | ISBN = 0-02-865604-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Twelvers, there is at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. [[Ali]] was the first of the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the [[Succession to Muhammad|rightful successor to Muhammad]], followed by male [[descendants of Muhammad]] through his daughter [[Fatimah]]. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was the brother of [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. The twelfth and final Imam is [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in [[The Occultation#Major Occultation|the Major Occultation]] until he returns to bring justice to the world.&lt;ref name="Imamat" /&gt; It is believed by [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] and [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]]. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.

The Twelve Imams also have a leading role within some [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders and are seen as the spiritual heads of Islam, because most of the [[Silsila]] ''(spiritual chain)'' of Sufi orders lead back to one of the Twelve Imams.

A '''villain''' (also known as, "'''baddie'''", "'''bad guy'''", "'''evil guy'''", "'''heavy'''" or "'''black hat'''") is an "[[evil]]" character in a story, whether a [[history|historical]] narrative or, especially, a work of [[fiction]]. 

The villain is a [[antagonist]] (though can be the [[protagonist]]){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} who tends to have a negative effect on other characters. A female villain is occasionally called a '''villainess'''. Random House Unabridged Dictionary defines villain as "a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime; scoundrel; or a character in a play, novel, or the like, who constitutes an important evil agency in the plot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/villain |website=[[Dictionary.com]] |publisher=[[Wayback Machine]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402110610/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/villain |archivedate=2014-04-02 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Image:Villains before going to Work receiving their Lord's Orders Miniature in the Proprietaire des Choses Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Library of the Arsenal in Paris.png|thumb|French villeins in the 15th century before going to work, receiving their Lord's Orders.]]

Villain comes from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] and [[Old French]] ''vilain'', which itself descends from the [[Late Latin]] word '' villanus'', meaning "farmhand",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert K. Barnhart |author2=Sol Steinmetz |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |date=1999 |publisher=Chambers |location=New York |isbn=0550142304 |page=1204}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of someone who is bound to the soil of a ''villa'', which is to say, worked on the equivalent of a [[plantation]] in [[Late Antiquity]], in Italy or [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David B. Guralnik |title=[[Webster's New World Dictionary]] |date=1984 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=0671418149 |edition=2nd college}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2018}} The same etymology produced [[villein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/villain |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to a person of less than knightly status and so came to mean a person who was not [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] and [[Politeness|polite]]. As a result of many unchivalrous and evil acts, such as [[betrayal|treachery]] or rape, being considered villainous in the modern sense of the word, it became used as a term of abuse and eventually took on its modern meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[C. S. Lewis]] |title=Studies in Words |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107688650 |pages=120-121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xONwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic word "[[churl]]", originally meaning "a non-servile peasant" and denoting the lowest rank of freemen in Saxon society, had gone through a similar degradation, as did the word "[[wikt:boor#Noun|boor]]" which originally meant "farmer".

==Folk and fairy tales==
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of Russian fairy tales, concluded that a [[fairy tale]] had only eight ''[[dramatis personae]]'', of which one was the villain,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Vladimir Propp |authorlink1=Vladimir Propp |title=Morphology of the Folk Tale |date=1968 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0292783760 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian tales. The actions that fell into a villain's sphere were:
* a story-initiating villainy, where the villain caused harm to the hero or his family 
* a conflict between the hero and the villain, either a fight or other competition
* pursuing the hero after he has succeeded in winning the fight or obtaining something from the villain

None of these acts necessarily occurs in a fairy tale, but when any of them do, the character that performs the act is the villain. The villain, therefore, could appear twice: once in the opening of the story, and a second time as the person sought out by the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

When a character performed only these acts, the character was a pure villain. Various villains also perform other functions in a fairy tale; a witch who fought the hero and ran away, and who lets the hero follow her, is also performing the task of "guidance" and thus acting as a helper.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

The functions could also be spread out among several characters. If a dragon acted as the villain but was killed by the hero, another character (such as the dragon's sisters) might take on the role of the villain and pursue the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

Two other characters could appear in roles that are villainous in the more general sense. One is the [[false hero]]: this character is always villainous, presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the happy ending.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Among these characters are [[Cinderella]]'s stepsisters, chopping off parts of their feet to fit on the shoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Tatar |authorlink1=Maria Tatar |title=The Annotated Brothers Grimm |date=2004 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W.W. Norton]] |isbn=0393058484 |page=136 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another character, the dispatcher, sends a hero on his quest. This might be an innocent request, to fulfill a legitimate need, but the dispatcher might also, villainously, lie to send a character on a quest in hopes of being rid of him.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Villainous foil==
[[File:Wicked Witch of the West W.W. Denslow.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is an example of a literary villain.]]

In fiction, villains commonly function in the dual role of adversary and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the story's heroes. In their role as an adversary, the villain serves as an obstacle the hero must struggle to overcome. In their role as a foil, the villain exemplifies characteristics that are diametrically opposed to those of the hero, creating a contrast distinguishing heroic traits from villainous ones.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Others point out that many acts of villains have a hint of wish-fulfillment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Das |first1=Sisir Kumar |title=A History of Indian Literature: 1911-1956 |date=1995 |publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]] |isbn=9788172017989 |page=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC&amp;pg=PA416 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes some people identify with them as characters more strongly than with the heroes. Because of this, a convincing villain must be given a [[characterization]] that provides a [[Base motive|motive]] for doing wrong, as well as being a worthy adversary to the hero. As put by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Roger Ebert |authorlink1=Roger Ebert |title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Movie Review (1982) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan-1982 |website=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en |date=January 1, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Portraying and employing villains in fiction==
[[Tod Slaughter]] always portrayed villainous characters on both stage and screen in a melodramatic manner, with mustache-twirling, eye-rolling, leering, [[evil laughter|cackling]], and [[hand-rubbing]] (however, this often failed to translate well from stage to screen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bryan Senn |title=Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939 |date=1996 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786401758 |page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeffery Richards |title=The Unknown 1930s: An Alternative History of the British Cinema, 1929-39 |date=2001 |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]] |isbn=9781860646287 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brad Warner]] states that "only cartoon villains cackle with glee while rubbing their hands together and dream of ruling the world in the name of all that is wicked and bad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Brad Warner]] |title=Sit Down and Shut Up: Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, and Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye |date=2007 |publisher=New World Library |isbn=9781577315599 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Bova]] recommends to authors that their works not contain villains. He states, in his ''Tips for writers'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the real world there are no villains. No one actually sets out to do evil... Fiction mirrors life.

===Sympathetic villain===
In an attempt to add realism to their stories, many writers will try to create "sympathetic" villains, the [[antithesis]] to an [[antihero]] called an '''anti-villain'''. These villains come in just as many shapes and sizes as anti-heroes do. Some may wish to make the world a better place but go to antagonistic lengths to do so (such as [[Doctor Octopus]] in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', who commits various crimes in an attempt to complete his goal of creating a cheap, renewable source of energy, and Dr. Horrible in ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]]'', who wants to rule the world so that he can solve all of its problems), or may employ a code of honor in fighting his enemies, even if it is to achieve antagonistic goals (examples include Murdock, a secondary villain in the game ''[[Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi]]'', who is honorable, but fights the player's army due to loyalty to his country). Other sympathetic villains may be pushed to antagonistic lifestyles by society's mistreatment of him due to prejudice against something he is a part of (such as [[racism]], as is the case in ''[[American History X]]''), but goes to absurd lengths to achieve the equality he desires, like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the ''[[X-Men]]'' comics and films. Others may include those manipulated by malevolent and opprobrious forces (such as [[Jack Torrance]] being manipulated by the Overlook Hotel in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''). Plot based video games tend to have two villains where one is sympathetic. This creates a foreseeable plot twist wherein either they die or they switch sides.

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.

'''Winamac''' was the name of a number of [[Potawatomi]] leaders and warriors beginning in the late 17th century. The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was soon transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]]. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg.

The Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the [[Fox Wars]] in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the [[War of 1812]]. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.

== Wilamet ==
In 1681, a group of Native Americans from several [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[New England]] accompanied French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] on an expedition to the west.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"&gt;Clifton, 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these Natives, Wilamet (or Ouilamette or Wilamek), was appointed by La Salle to serve as a laison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilamet was adopted by the [[Potawatomi]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sleeper-Smith, ''Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2001), 175n35.&lt;/ref&gt; and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was eventually transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"/&gt; Before long, he was recognized by the French as the "chief" of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"&gt;Clifton, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or ''okama''&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;), but was instead a "chief" appointed by the French.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the [[Franco-Indian alliance]]. According to historian [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], "as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief".&lt;ref&gt;White, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering [[Iroquois]] influence in the Lake Michigan region.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"/&gt; In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Cadillac]] against the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, Wilamet and [[Onanghisse]] (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief,&lt;ref&gt;White, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; represented the Potawatomis at the great [[Treaty of Montreal]], which ended the war with the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fox Wars]] (1712–1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"&gt;Clifton, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe.&lt;ref&gt;White, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"/&gt; The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 89; Edmunds, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812 era==
{{further|Indiana in the War of 1812|Illinois Territory in the War of 1812}}
During the [[War of 1812]] era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"&gt;Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt; American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the "anti-American" or "hostile" Winamek and the "pro-American" or "friendly" Winamek.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 528; Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-American Winamac===
The "anti-American" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the [[Osage people|Osages]], Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor [[Ninian Edwards]] demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief [[Chief Gomo|Gomo]] informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to [[Prophetstown (village)|Prophetstown]] in Indiana, headquarters of the anti-American resistance movement led by the [[Tenskwatawa|Shawnee Prophet]] and his brother [[Tecumseh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with chiefs [[Shabbona]] and [[Waubonsie]], Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] at Prophetstown in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winamac began the organization for the 1812 [[siege of Fort Wayne]]. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio.  What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce.  Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort.  Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander.  Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended.

After the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent [[Matthew Elliott (loyalist)|Matthew Elliott]]. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan ([[Spemica Lawba]]), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-American Winamac===
The "pro-American" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash.  Beginning in 1807 he and [[Five Medals]] and [[Topinabee (I)|Topinabee]] continued to ask the American government for agricultural help.  The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people.  In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land.  A council was called at [[Fort Wayne]] in September.  Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession.  When {{convert|3|e6acre|km2}} were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi.  Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands.  The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio.  Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing.  Winamac provide information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown.  Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison.  Here, [[Tecumseh]] denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.&lt;ref name=McPherson&gt;'''Indian Names in Indiana''' by Alan McPherson, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois.  To end the destruction, councils where held at [[Cahokia]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the [[Shawnee]] spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors.  When [[William Henry Harrison|Gov. Harrison]] marched north to [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] on the [[Tippecanoe River|Tippecanoe]] in November 1811, Winamac marched with him.  When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet.  Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by.  On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day.  When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops.  The Potawatomi were led by [[Shabbona]] with [[Waubonsie|Waubansee]] and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi).  The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages.  The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements.  Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements.  His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt;

When the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements.  He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived.  On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan.  Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt; [[Fort Dearborn]] fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16.

In September 1817, Winamac and [[Metea]] represented the eastern Potawatomis at the [[treaty of Fort Meigs]], in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Winamac died in 1821.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13788">The '''Witches of Warboys''' were Alice Samuel and her family, who were accused of, and executed for [[witchcraft]] between 1589 and 1593 in the village of [[Warboys]], in the [[fens]] of England.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Strange and Admirable Discouerie of the Three Witches of Warboys Arraigned, Conuicted, and Executed at the Last Assises at Huntington, for the Bewitching of the Fiue Daughters of Robert Throckmorton Esquire, and Other Persons (1593), Reprint|year=2010|publisher=BiblioBazaar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of many [[witch trials in the early modern period]], but scholar Barbara Rosen claims it "attracted probably more notice than any other in the sixteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen |first=Barbara |title=Witchcraft in England 1558–1618 |location=Amherst |publisher=University  of Massachusetts |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at [[Warboys]] in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 10-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the [[Squire]] of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

Robert Throckmorton was a close friend of [[Henry Williams (alias Cromwell)|Sir Henry Cromwell]], one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of [[Oliver Cromwell]].  In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

==Initial allegations==

===Throckmorton family===
The first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589.  Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell’s witchcraft. Jane’s fits were described as such: "Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie".&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discouerie of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane's mother and grandmother were by the child’s side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: "Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her". Jane's mother  thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick.  However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her.  It did not.  After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane’s urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton’s daughters fell sick to the same illness  that was afflicting Jane.&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"/&gt;

These daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: "Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discovery of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the "Michaelmas before" (September 29, 1588).{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}} Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to "(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed".{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}}   When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day.  They believed that God freed them of this [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

===Lady Cromwell===
In March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice.  During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of [[scissors]] and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a [[folk tradition|folk]] remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.&lt;ref name="Luke Matin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matin |first1=Luke |title=The Witch Trials – Witches of Warboys Witch Trials |url=http://www.witchcraftandwitches.com/trials_warboys.html|publisher=Luke Matin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Following the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day.  However, she confessed again when she was brought before the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and taken to [[Huntingdon]] where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband.  The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell ("Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luke Matin" /&gt;

==Posthumous proof==
The jailer and his wife examined the corpses.
{{quote|[H]e found upon the body of the old woman Alice Samuel a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an inch; which both he and his wife perceiving, at the first sight thereof meant not to disclose because it was adjoining so secret a place which was not decent to be seen. Yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a matter, and decently covering that privy place a little above which it grew, they made open show thereof unto diverse that stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations |first=Diane |last=Purkiss |publisher=Routledge |year=2013|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a [[witches' mark]] (also known as a "devil's mark") was important legal proof at this period in England. "[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kermode |first=J.I. |last2=Walker |first2=Garthine |title=Women, crime and the courts in early modern England |date=1994 |publisher=UCL Press |location=London |isbn=1857281403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Creager |editor-first=Angela N.H. |last=Jordan|first=William Chester |title=The animal-human boundary: historical perspectives |date=2002 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y |isbn=9781580461207 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Words like daggers: violent female speech in early modern England |date=2015 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=[S.l.] |isbn=978-0-8032-5488-6 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in [[feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials]]. It is also cited by writers such as [[Lynn Picknett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Picknett |first1=Lynn |title=The secret history of Lucifer: the ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci code |date=2005 |publisher=Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1845292638 |edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The scholar [[George Lyman Kittredge|George Kittredge]] (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial "the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England", partially because it had "demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the [[Witchcraft Acts#Witchcraft Act 1604|Witchcraft Act of 1604]].

Following the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeWindt |first=Anne |title=Witchcraft and Conflicting Visions of the Ideal Village Community |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=34 |year=1995 |pages=427–463}} JSTOR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1832">'''Xenagoras''' ({{lang-grc|Ξεναγόρας}}) was the name of a number of men of [[classical antiquity]]:

*[[Xenagoras of Halicarnassus]], companion of the Achaemenid commander [[Masistes]]
*[[Xenagoras (historian)]], a historical writer, likely of the 2nd century BCE
*Xenagoras, historian, and father of the historian [[Nymphis]]. Possibly the same man as the above. If so, he must have lived in the early part of the second century BCE.
*[[Xenagoras (geometer)]], who wrote in the ancient world about the heights of mountains
*Xenagoras, an [[archon]] of [[Delphi]] in late 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
