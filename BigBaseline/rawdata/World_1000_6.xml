== Name ==
The term Brussels effect was coined in 2012 by Professor Anu Bradford of Columbia Law School&lt;ref name=Bradford2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecture, March 2012 - "''The Brussels Effect: The Rise of a Regulatory Superstate in Europe''" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeFmR3Fkjzw&lt;/ref&gt; and named after the similar [[California effect]] that can be seen within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=David|title=Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental regulation in a global economy|date=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674900837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race to the top and race to the bottom ==
The [[California effect]] and the Brussels effect are a form of ‘race to the top’ where the most stringent standard has an appeal to companies operating across multiple regulatory environments as it makes global production and exports easier.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the ‘Brussels effect’ will undermine Brexit regulatory push'' July 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/fd5ca278-6654-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the whole world feels the ‘Brussels effect’'' November 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/7059dbf8-a82a-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale Insights – ''Three Questions: Prof. David Bach on the Reach of European Privacy Regulations'' https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/three-questions-prof-david-bach-on-the-reach-of-european-privacy-regulations&lt;/ref&gt; The effects are the opposite of the ''Delaware effect'', a [[race to the bottom]] where jurisdictions can purposely choose to lower its regulatory requirements in an attempt to attract businesses looking for the least stringent standard. &lt;ref name="Bloomberg NJ Del."&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robert E. Wright|title=How Delaware Became the King of U.S. Corporate Charters|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-06-08/how-delaware-became-the-king-of-u-s-corporate-charters|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=''Bloomberg View''|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Anti-trust===
The October 2000 $42 billion proposed acquisition of US-based Honeywell International by US-based General Electric was blocked by the EU antitrust authorities on the grounds of risking a horizontal monopoly in jet engines. The merger could not proceed because, despite the American Department of Justice having already approved the merger between these two US based entities, it was not legally possible to let the acquisition proceed in one important market, but not in another. &lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Case No COMP/M.2220 - General Electric/Honeywell http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=2_M_2220&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
US-based multinational [[Dow Chemical]] announced in 2006 it would comply with the EU's [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) regulation for the production and use of chemical substances across its global operation.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dow and REACH - Protecting human health and the environment https://reach.dow.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reach External FAQs https://consumer.dow.com/en-us/technical-support/ehs-portal/reach-external-faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airplane emissions===
In 2012 the EU included aviation into its existing [[European_Union_Emission_Trading_Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]]. This means that any airline, regardless of their country of origin, has to purchase emissions permits for any flights within the [[European_Economic_Area|European Economic Area]]. &lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Reducing emissions from aviation https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of complying with EU aviation emission regulation puts pressure on manufacturers to design airplanes with improved efficiency and reduced emissions. As major airlines would not likely purchase airplanes specifically to fly outside the EEA, the EU’s stricter aviation standards have an impact on global airplane fleets, regardless of the jurisdiction of the airline.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;

===Data protection and privacy===
With the introduction of the[[Data_Protection_Directive | Data Protection Directive]] in 1995 the EU had opted for a strict top-down approach to data privacy. &lt;ref&gt;Gady, Franz-Stefan (2014) EU/U.S. Approaches to Data Privacy and the "Brussels Effect": A Comparative Analysis https://www.jstor.org/stable/43773645&lt;/ref&gt; Its successor, the EU's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), was adopted on 14 April 2016 and had a global effect &lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Information wars: How Europe became the world’s data police'' May 2018 https://www.ft.com/content/1aa9b0fa-5786-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development – ''Europe’s Data Privacy Rules Set New Global Approach to Consumer Rights'' May 2018 https://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/europe%e2%80%99s-data-privacy-rules-set-new-global-approach-to-consumer-rights&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, during negotiations for a new Japan-EU trade deal, Japan set up an independent agency to handle privacy complaints to conform with the EU's new privacy regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Politico.EU – ''Europe’s new data protection rules export privacy standards worldwide'' January 2018 https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-data-protection-privacy-standards-gdpr-general-protection-data-regulation/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Common heritage of mankind''' (also termed the '''common heritage of humanity''', '''common heritage of humankind''' or '''common heritage principle''') is a principle of [[international law]] which holds that defined territorial areas and elements of humanity's common heritage (cultural and natural) should be held in trust for future generations and be protected from exploitation by individual [[nation states]] or [[corporations]].

==Origins==
In his essay ''Toward Perpetual Peace'', [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to "use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common" would "finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. 'Toward Perpetual Peace' in Practical Philosophy-Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Gregor MJ (trans.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1999. p 329 (8:358).&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''Common Heritage of Mankind'', however, was first mentioned in the preamble to the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The Hague 14 May 1954 http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html accessed 3 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of 'Mankind' is also mentioned in outer space treaties.&lt;ref&gt;The 1972 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, Mar. 29, 1972, 24 U.S.T. 2389, 961 U.N.T.S. 187 (entered into force Sept. 1, 1972) and the 1975 Convention on Registration of Objects Launched Into Outer Space, Jan. 14, 1975, 28 U.S.T. 695, 1023 U.N.T.S. 15 (entered into force Sept. 15, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; 'Mankind' as a subject in international law also appears in the Preamble of the [[United Nations Charter]], the Preamble of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] (1949) and the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (1968).&lt;ref name=Gyula04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gyula Gál |title=Some Remarks to General Clauses of Treaty Space Law |journal=Miskolc Journal of International Law (Miskolci Nemzetközi Jogi Közlemények) |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law of the Sea Treaty ==
[[File:Oceans.png|150px|left|thumb|Map of the world's oceans]]
In 1970, [[United Nations General Assembly]] Resolution 2749, the ''Declaration of Principles Governing the Seabed and Ocean Floor'', was adopted by 108 nation states and stated that the deep seabed should be preserved for peaceful purposes and is the "Common Heritage of Mankind."&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Res. 2749 (XXV), ¶ 1, U.N. Doc. A/RES/25/2749 (Dec. 12, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Common Heritage of Mankind concept was stated to relate to "the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction" under Article 136 of the [[United Nations]] [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] (UNCLOS).&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea art. 1, para. 1, Dec. 10, 1982, 1833 U.N.T.S. 397 [UNCLOS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Payoyo argues that the ''common heritage of humanity'' principle in Part XI of the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] should favour developing states (who were the voice of [[conscience]] in establishing it), and not merely in some transient 'affirmative action' manner.&lt;ref&gt;Payoyo PB. Cries of the Sea. World Inequality, Sustainable Development and the Common Heritage of Humanity. Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague. 1997 {{ISBN|90-411-0504-2}} p 326.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims, however, that the 1994 ''Implementation Agreement'' facilitated control by industrialised countries of the [[International Seabed Authority]] (ISA), allowing access by the private sector to the deep [[sea bed]] and inhibiting constructive dialogue on sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Payoyo PB. Cries of the Sea. World Inequality, Sustainable Development and the Common Heritage of Humanity. Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague. 1997 {{ISBN|90-411-0504-2}} p458.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core conceptual components==
Maltese Ambassador [[Arvid Pardo]], one of the founders of the ''common heritage of humanity'' concept under international law, has claimed that it challenges the "structural relationship between rich and poor countries" and amounts to a "revolution not merely in the law of the sea, but also in international relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pardo A |title=Ocean, Space and Mankind |journal=Third World Quarterly |volume=6 |pages=559–69 |year=1984 |doi=10.1080/01436598408419785 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main architects of the principle under international space law has claimed that it is "the most important legal principle achieved by man throughout thousands of years during which law has existed as the regulating element of social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;Cocca A. Introduction to the Study of the Legal Framework for Economic Activity in Space. Cordoba, 1982. p159 cited in {{cite journal |author=Danilenko GM |title=The Concept of the "Common Heritage of Mankind" in International Law |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law |volume=XIII |pages=247–63 at p 250 fn11 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This praise relates to the fact that [[international law]] in the ''common heritage of humanity'' principle is seeking to protect, respect and fulfill the interests of human beings independently of any politically motivated [[sovereign state]]; the concept covering all humans wherever they are living, as well as future generations.&lt;ref name=Gyula04/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Prue|title=Common Heritage of Mankind: A Bibliography of Legal Writing|date=2013|publisher=Fondation de Malte|location=Malta|isbn=978-1-291-57725-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Common-Heritage-Mankind-Bibliography-Writing/dp/1291577254/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392109201&amp;sr=1-4|author2=Stroud, Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frakes has identified five core components of the Common Heritage of Humanity concept.&lt;ref name=Frakes03&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frakes, Jennifer |title=The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? |journal=Wisconsin International Law Journal |volume=21 |pages=409 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, there can be no private or public appropriation; no one legally owns common heritage spaces. Second, representatives from all nations must manage resources contained in such a territorial or conceptual area on behalf of all since a commons area is considered to belong to everyone; this practically necessitating a special agency to coordinate shared management. Third, all nations must actively share with each other the benefits acquired from exploitation of the resources from the commons heritage region, this requiring restraint on the profit-making activities of private corporate entities; this linking the concept to that of [[global public good]]. Fourth, there can be no weaponry or military installations established in territorial commons areas. Fifth, the commons should be preserved for the benefit of future generations, and to avoid a "[[tragedy of the commons]]" scenario.&lt;ref name=Frakes03/&gt; Academic claims have been made that where the principle requires the establishment of an international resource management regime, prior to establishment of such a regime a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on resource exploitation should be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Narayana RK |title=Common Heritage of Mankind and the Moon Treaty |journal=Indian Journal of International Law |volume=21 |pages=275 |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sehgal N |title=The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind and the Moon Treaty |journal=Indian Journal of International Law |volume=26 |issue= |pages=112 |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a position does not appear to have been supported by most states during the respective drafting negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Danilenko GM |title=The Concept of the "Common Heritage of Mankind" in International Law |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law |volume=XIII |pages=247–63 at p 259 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Destroyed Statue, July 17, 2005 at 15-53.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bamian Valley]] - UNESCO World Heritage listed site in [[Afghanistan]], showing destroyed [[Buddha]] statue.]]
A similar principle of international law holds that the world's [[cultural heritage|cultural]] and natural heritage (as nominated for listing by nation states) must be protected by states parties to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. World Heritage Convention. http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/ (accessed 27 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study in the use of these provisions was provided by the [[Franklin Dam]] [[non-violent protest]] campaign against the construction of a dam of [[Australia]]'s last wild river; they being held by the [[Australian High Court]] to provide a valid basis for legislation protecting the [[Franklin River]]. Justice Lionel Murphy wrote in that case (''[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]'') about the Common Heritage of Humanity principle: "The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war&amp;nbsp;... [t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]] (1983) 46 ALR 625 at 733 and 734.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNESCO ''Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights'' declares in Article 1 that: "The [[human genome]] underlies the fundamental unity of all members of the human family, as well as the recognition of their inherent dignity and diversity. In a symbolic sense, it is the heritage of humanity." Article 4 states: "The human genome in its natural state shall not give rise to financial gains."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.

==Potential applications==

It was argued at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] and has been advocated by academics that global communication between individuals over the [[internet]] should be regarded as part of the Common Heritage of Mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henrik Spang-hanssen |title=Public International Computer Network Law Issues |publisher=Djoef Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=87-574-1486-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[spirtuality|spiritual]] or [[natural law]] perspective, it has been argued that for [[world peace]] to be achieved, [[laws]] and [[government]] [[policies]] should create the social preconditions whereby [[conscience]], properly understood, can be delinked from (often destructive) [[fundamentalist]] religious ideologies, and associated with a [[universal consciousness]], access to which is the Common Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffiths, Bede |title=A New Vision of Reality: Western Science, Eastern Mysticism and Christian Faith |publisher=Harpercollins/STL |year=1992 |page=276 |isbn=0-00-627636-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such thinking with associated implications about how a [[sustainable]] world in the future should be [[regulated]] is common to members of the [[Global Ecovillage Network]].&lt;ref&gt;William Thompson. Passages About the Earth: An Exploration of the New Planetary Culture. Rider and Co. London. 1974. Ch 7. 'To Findhorn and Lindisfarne' pp 150–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Equatorial countries have proposed that the [[geostationary orbit]] over the [[high seas]] should be declared the ''common heritage of mankind''.&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries''. Bagota 3 Dec 1976. ITU Doc. WARC-BS (17 Jan 1977) 81-E. Reproduced: Journal of Space Law 1978; 6:193.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that a [[World government]] would manage common heritage areas according to principles of ''planetary democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt, Alexander. Why a World State is Inevitable. European Journal of International Relations. 2003; 9 (4): 491–542&lt;/ref&gt; The international law concept of common heritage of humanity has also been linked with [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, Luis. Political Theory of Global Justice: A Cosmopolitan Case for the World State. London, Routledge. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Common heritage of humanity as a concept of international law is supported by many of the principles in the [[Earth Charter]] civil society Initiative&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html accessed 5 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies about the principle==
[[File:NGC 6302 Hubble 2009.full.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[NGC 6302]] [[nebula]]. Militarization of [[Outer Space]] would be contrary to ''common heritage of humanity'' principles.]]Kemal Baslar has stated that the Common Heritage of Mankind principle "is a philosophical idea that questions the regimes of globally important resources regardless of their situation, and requires major changes in the world to apply its provisions. In other words, the application and enforcement of the common heritage of mankind require a critical reexamination of many well-established principles and doctrines of classical [[international law]], such as acquisition of territory, consent-based sources of international law, [[sovereignty]], [[Equality before the law|equality]], [[resource allocation]] and international personality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kemal Baslar |title=The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind in International Law |series=Developments in International Law |volume=30 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location=Dordrecht |year=1997 |isbn=90-411-0505-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''common heritage of humanity'' principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to the [[tragedy of the commons]] dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by [[Garrett Hardin]] in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243–1248. Also available [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf here] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott James Shackelford. 2008. "The Tragedy of the Common Heritage of Mankind"
Available at: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1407332 accessed 30 Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The article critically analyzes a dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest, ultimately destroy a shared limited resource even when each acknowledges that outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of [[conscience]] in achieving justice and equality in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Axelrod, Robert M. |title=The evolution of cooperation |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-465-02121-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting [[economic rationalism]] on such social and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Appell, G. N. (1993). [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081217063416/http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00002203/01/HARDIN.pdf Hardin's Myth of the Commons: The Tragedy of Conceptual Confusions]. Working Paper 8. Phillips, ME: Social Transformation and Adaptation Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many that point out that as what we are seeking is a social contract, privatisation would actually annihilate any possibility of rational use - the land would simply be in enclosure. Hardin's views are based on [[Malthusian]] ideas of competition and over population, we have now accepted that it is the nature of man's consumption (not his numbers) that is causing the destruction of the environment.

The extent to which the Common Heritage of Mankind principle does or should control the activities of private [[multinational corporations]] as well as [[nation states]], particularly with regard to [[mining]] activities, remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nicholson G |title=The Common Heritage of Mankind and Mining: An Analysis of the Law as to the High Seas, Outer Space, the Antarctic, and World Heritage |journal=New Zealand Journal of Environmental Law |volume=6 |pages=177 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Underdeveloped nations]] often see the principle as a means of protecting critical resources from exploitation by capitalist nations and their corporations.&lt;ref name=Frakes03/&gt; As world oil, coal and mineral reserves are depleted there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit Common Heritage of Mankind areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyner CC |title=Legal Implications of the Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind |journal=International and Comparative Law Quarterly |volume=35 |pages=190 |year=1986 |doi=10.1093/iclqaj/35.1.190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears at the present time that exploration of outer space is unlikely to initially proceed under the jurisdiction of a supranational organization, but rather through the coordination of national space programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vereshchetin VS, Kamenetskaya EP |title=On the Way to a World Space Organization |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law  |volume=12 |pages=337 |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that photosynthesis in its natural or artificial forms should be considered the common heritage of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA.

In [[biogeography]], a [[taxon]] is said to have a '''cosmopolitan distribution''' if its [[range (biology)|range]] extends across all or most of the world in appropriate [[habitat]]s. Such a taxon is said to exhibit cosmopolitanism or cosmopolitism. The opposite extreme is [[endemism]].

==Related terms and concepts==
The term '''pandemism''' also is in use, but not all authors are consistent in the sense in which they use the term; some speak of pandemism mainly in referring to diseases and [[pandemic]]s, and some as a term intermediate between endemism and cosmopolitanism, in effect regarding pandemism as '''subcosmopolitanism'''. This means near cosmopolitanism, but with major gaps in the [[species distribution|distribution]], say, complete absence from Australia.&lt;ref name="Simpson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael G. Simpson|title=Plant Systematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj8KRImgyf4C&amp;pg=PA720|date=19 July 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-092208-9|pages=720–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarperServais2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D. A. T. Harper|author2=T. Servais|title=Early Palaeozoic Biogeography and Palaeogeography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mIWhAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=27 January 2014|publisher=Geological Society of London|isbn=978-1-86239-373-8|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terminology varies, and there is some debate whether the true opposite of endemism is pandemism or cosmopolitism.&lt;ref name="Rapoport2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eduardo H Rapoport|title=Areography: Geographical Strategies of Species|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePHfBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251|date=22 October 2013|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4831-5277-6|pages=251–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects and degrees==
The term "cosmopolitan distribution" usually should not be taken literally, because it often is applied loosely in various contexts. Commonly the intention is not to include polar regions, extreme altitudes, oceans, deserts, or small, isolated islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology and Environmental Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKTeiqPBpM4C&amp;pg=PA164|date=15 July 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-1324-6|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[housefly]] is nearly as cosmopolitan as any animal species, but it is neither oceanic nor polar in its distribution.&lt;ref name="RussellOtranto2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard C. Russell|author2=Domenico Otranto|author3=Richard L. Wall|title=The Encyclopedia of Medical and Veterinary Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9QfhF_wQSV4C&amp;pg=PA157|year=2013|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-78064-037-2|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the term "cosmopolitan weed" implies no more than that the plant in question occurs on all continents except [[Antarctica]]; it is not meant to suggest that the species is present in all regions of every continent.

==Oceanic and terrestrial==
Another concept in [[biogeography]] is that of [[Oceanography|oceanic]] cosmopolitanism and endemism. Although there is a temptation to regard the [[World Ocean]] as a medium without biological boundaries, this is far from reality; many physical and biological barriers interfere with either the spread or continued residence of many species. For example, temperature gradients prevent free migration of tropical species between the Atlantic and Indian-plus-Pacific oceans, even though there is open passage past continental masses such as the Americas and Africa/Eurasia. Again, as far as many species are concerned, the [[Southern Ocean]] and the Northern marine regions are completely isolated from each other by the intolerable temperatures of the tropical regions. In the light of such considerations, it is no surprise to find that endemism and cosmopolitanism are quite as marked in the oceans as on land.

==Ecological delimitation==
Another aspect of cosmopolitanism is that of ecological limitations. A species that is apparently cosmopolitan because it occurs in all oceans might in fact occupy only [[littoral zone|littoral zones]], or only particular ranges of depths, or only [[Estuary|estuaries]], for example. Analogously, [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] species might be present only in forests, or mountainous regions, or sandy [[arid]] regions or the like. Such distributions might be patchy, or extended, but narrow. Factors of such a nature are taken widely for granted, so they seldom are mentioned explicitly in mentioning cosmopolitan distributions.

==Regional and temporal variation in populations==
Cosmopolitanism of a particular species or variety should not be confused with cosmopolitanism of higher taxa.  For example, the family [[Antlion|Myrmeleontidae]] is cosmopolitan in the sense that every continent except Antarctica is home to some indigenous species within the Myrmeleontidae, but nonetheless no one species, nor even genus, of the Myrmeleontidae is cosmopolitan. Conversely, partly as a result of human introduction of unnatural [[Beekeeping|apiculture]] to the New World, ''[[western honey bee|Apis mellifera]]'' probably is the only cosmopolitan member of its family; the rest of the family [[Apidae]] have modest distributions.

Even where a cosmopolitan population is recognised as a single species, such as indeed ''Apis mellifera'', there generally will be variation between regional sub-populations. Such variation commonly is at the level of [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] or [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]], whereas some variation is too slight or inconsistent for formal recognition.

For an example of subspecific variation, consider the so-called "[[Africanized bee|African killer bee]]", which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera scutellata]]'', and the [[African bee|Cape bee]], which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera capensis]]''; both of them are in the same cosmopolitan species ''Apis mellifera'', but their ranges barely overlap.

Other cosmopolitan species, such as the [[osprey]] and [[house sparrow]], present similar examples, but in yet other species there are less familiar complications: some migratory birds such as the [[Arctic tern]] occur from the Arctic to the [[Southern Ocean]], but at any one season of the year they are likely to be largely in passage or concentrated at only one end of the range. Also, some such species breed only at one end of the range. Seen purely as an aspect of cosmopolitanism, such distributions could be seen as temporal, seasonal variations.

Other complications of cosmopolitanism on a planet too large for local populations to interbreed routinely with each other, lead to genetic effects such as [[ring species]], for example in the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls.&lt;ref name="Kunz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Kunz|title=Do Species Exist: Principles of Taxonomic Classification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQxwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT211|date=2 August 2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-66426-9|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also lead to the formation of [[Cline (biology)|clines]] such as in [[Drosophila]].&lt;ref name="KrimbasPowell1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Costas B. Krimbas|author2=Jeffrey R. Powell|title=Drosophila Inversion Polymorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PLSPhg3KPGgC&amp;pg=PA23|date=21 August 1992|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-6547-8|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and modern==

Cosmopolitan distributions can be observed both in extinct and extant species. For example, ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' was cosmopolitan in the Early Triassic after a mass extinction.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M. J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern world, the [[killer whale]] has a cosmopolitan distribution, extending over most of the Earth's [[ocean]]s. The wasp ''[[Copidosoma floridanum]]'' is another example, as it is found around the world. Other examples include [[human]]s, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[orchid]]s, the foliose [[lichen]] ''[[Parmelia sulcata]]'', and the [[Mollusca|mollusc]] genus ''[[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]]''.&lt;ref name="Spellerberg"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Ian F.

==Impact on disease==

===Impact on vascular disease===
[[File:Erythromelalgia.jpg|[[Erythromelalgia]] in a 77-year-old woman |thumb]]
A good example of the impact of global warming on health can be seen in the disease [[erythromelalgia]].&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=T |last2=Zhang |first2=Y |last3=Lin |first3=H |last4=Lv |first4=X |last5=Xiao |first5=J |last6=Zeng |first6=W |last7=Gu |first7=Y |last8=Rutherford |first8=S |last9=Tong |first9=S|last10=Ma|first10=W |display-authors=3 |title=A large temperature fluctuation may trigger an epidemic erythromelalgia outbreak in China |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |date=30 March 2015 |volume=5 |id=Article Number 9525 |pmid=25820221 |doi=10.1038/srep09525 |pmc=4377627 |pages=9525}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a vascular disease that is commonly triggered by the involvement of change in temperature, which leads to syndromes including (first and second degree) burning pain, increased temperature, erythema and swelling, of mainly the hands and feet that are affected.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;

In a Chinese study, epidemic Erythromelalgia appears quite common in southern China, most likely due to a sharp decline in temperature following by a rapid increase of temperature and the effects this has on the body.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;  The acral small superficial arteries intensely constrict and dilate during the sharp decline of temperature, whereas a sharp increase of temperature, the intense expansion of [[capillaries]] irritate the nerve endings around, and thus lead to symptoms including burning pain, increased temperature, erythema and swelling.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;
As climate change proceeds, more Erythromelalgia outbreaks may occur because of the extreme weather events that are projected to increase in coming decades.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;

===Impact on infectious diseases===
Warming oceans and a changing climate are resulting in extreme weather patterns which have brought about an increase of [[infectious diseases]]—both new and re-emerging.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA29 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |chapter=The Mosquito's Bite |pp=29–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emerging Infections" /&gt;  These extreme weather patterns are creating extended [[rainy seasons]] in some areas,&lt;ref name="Sobering Predictions"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA62 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |chapter=Sobering Predictions |pp=62–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended periods of [[drought]] in others,&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meehl |first1=Gerald A. |first2=Thomas F. |last2=Stocker |first3=W.D. |last3=Collins |first4=P. |last4=Friedlingstein |first5=A.T. |last5=Gaye |first6=J.M. |last6=Gregory |first7=A. |last7=Kitoh |first8=R. |last8=Knutti |first9=J.M. |last9=Murphy |first10=A. |last10=Noda |first11=S.C.B. |last11=Raper |first12=I.G. |last12=Watterson |first13=A.J. |last13=Weaver |first14=Z.-C. |last14=Zhao |display-authors=3 |chapter=Global Climate Projections |editor-last1=Solomon |editor-first1=S. |editor-first2=D. |editor-last2=Qin |editor-first3=M. |editor-last3=Manning |editor-first4=Z. |editor-last4=Chen |editor-first5=M. |editor-last5=Marquis |editor-first6=K.B. |editor-last6=Averyt |editor-first7=M. |editor-last7=Tignor |editor-first8=H.L. |editor-last8=Miller |display-editors=3 |title=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

==== Impact of warmer and wetter climates ====

Mosquito-borne diseases are probably the greatest threat to humans as they include [[malaria]], [[Lymphatic filariasis|elephantiasis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and [[dengue fever]].&lt;ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reiter |first=Paul |title=Climate Change and Mosquito-Borne Disease |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |year=2001 |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=141–161 |url=http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.01109s1141 |pmid=11250812 |pmc=1240549 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824222504/http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elephantiasis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunter |first=P.R. |title=Climate change and waterborne and vector-borne disease |journal=[[Journal of Applied Microbiology]] |year=2003 |volume=94 |pages=37S–46S |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2672.94.s1.5.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health" /&gt; Studies are showing higher prevalence of these diseases in areas that have experienced extreme flooding and drought.&lt;ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease" /&gt;&lt;ref name=elephantiasis /&gt;   Flooding creates more standing water for mosquitoes to breed; as well,  shown that these vectors are able to feed more and grow faster in warmer climates.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; As the climate warms over the oceans and coastal regions, warmer temperatures are also creeping up to higher elevations allowing mosquitoes to survive in areas they had never been able to before.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; As the climate continues to warm there is a risk that malaria will make a return to the developed world.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;

[[Ticks]] are also thriving in the warmer temperatures allowing them to feed and grow at a faster rate.&lt;ref name=Ticks&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Süss |first1=J. |last2=Klaus |first2=C. |last3=Gerstengarbe |first3=F.W. |last4=Werner |first4=P.C. |title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

Another impact that the warming global temperature has had is on the frequency and severity of heat waves. In addition to dehydration and heat stroke, these heat waves have also resulted in epidemics of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Recent studies have shown that prolonged heat exposure, physical exertion, and dehydration are sufficient factors to developing CKD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Climate Change and the Emergent Epidemic of CKD from Heat Stress in Rural Communities: the Case for Heat Stress Nephropathy|last=Glaser et al | pmid=27151892 | doi=10.2215/CJN.13841215|volume=11|issue=8 |pmc=4974898|year=2016|journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|pages=1472–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cases are occurring across the world congruently with heat stress nephropathy.

Other diseases on the rise due to extreme weather include [[hantavirus]],&lt;ref name=Hantavirus&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klempa |first=B. |title=Hantaviruses and Climate Change |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |date=June 2009 |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=518–523 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02848.x|pmid=19604276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[schistosomiasis]],&lt;ref name=elephantiasis /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMichael |first1=A.J. |last2=Woodruff |first2=R.E. |last3=Hales |first3=S. |title=Climate change and human health: present and future risks |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=11 March 2006 |volume=367 |issue=9513 |pages=859–869 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68079-3|pmid=16530580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[onchocerciasis]] (river blindness),&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health" /&gt;  and tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="Emerging Infections"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Paul R. |title=Climate change and emerging infectious diseases |journal=Microbes and Infection |year=2001 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=747–754 |doi=10.1016/s1286-4579(01)01429-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also  causes the rise in hay fever, as when the weather gets warmer there is a rise in pollen levels in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaftel|first=Holly|year=2016|title=A blanket around the earth|url=|journal=A Blanket Around the Earth|volume=1|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Projected increases in temperature would make parts of southwest Asia uninhabitable, when temperature combined with high humidity reaches a [[wet-bulb temperature]] of 35&amp;nbsp;°C, the threshold for a fit human to survive in well-ventilated conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2833.html |title=Future temperature in southwest Asia projected to exceed a threshold for human adaptability |journal=Nature |year=2015 |first1=Jeremy S. |last1=Pal |first2=Elfatih A.

Warmer temperatures may also lead an increase in aggression levels. Research has shows links between higher temperatures and increased aggressive and criminal behaviour. Which can be seen by the rise in the rate of criminality during the warmer summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padhy|first=Susanta|date=2015|title=Mental health effects of climate change|journal=Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=19|issue=1|pages=3–7|pmc=4446935|pmid=26023264|doi=10.4103/0019-5278.156997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Impact of warmer oceans ====

The warming oceans are becoming a breeding ground for toxic algae blooms (also known as [[red tides]]) and [[cholera]].&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mozambique /&gt; As the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the oceans increase, the cholera bacteria that lives within [[zooplankton]] emerge from their dormant state.&lt;ref name=Mozambique /&gt;  The changing winds and changing ocean currents push the zooplankton toward the coastline, carrying the cholera bacteria, which then contaminate drinking water, causing [[cholera outbreaks]].&lt;ref name=Mozambique&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=6–28 |chapter=Mozambique}}&lt;/ref&gt; As flooding increases there is also an increase in cholera epidemics as the flood waters that are carrying the bacteria are infiltrating the drinking water supply.&lt;ref name="Global Health"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=St. Louis |first1=Michael E. |last2=Hess |first2=Jeremy J. |title=Climate Change Impacts on and Implications for Global Health |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=527–538 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.023|pmid=18929979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   El Nino has also been linked with cholera outbreaks because this weather pattern warms the shoreline waters, causing the cholera bacteria to multiply rapidly.&lt;ref name=Mozambique /&gt;&lt;ref name="Global Health" /&gt;

====Malaria====

[[Malaria]] is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that infects humans and other animals caused by microorganisms in the [[Plasmodium]] family. It begins with a bite from an infected female mosquito, which introduces the parasite through its saliva and into the infected host's circulatory system. It then travels through the bloodstream into the liver where it can mature and reproduce.&lt;ref name=Lancet&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Brian M. |last1=Greenwood |first2=Kalifa |last2=Bojang |first3=Christopher J.M. |last3=Whitty |first4=Geoffrey A.T. |last4=Targett |title=Malaria |journal=The Lancet |date=23 April 2005 |volume=365 |pages=1487–1498 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66420-3 |pmid=15850634 |issue=9469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease causes symptoms that typically include fever, headache, shaking chills, anemia, and in severe cases can progress to coma or death.

'About 3.2 billion people – nearly half of the world's population – are at risk of malaria. In 2015, there were roughly 214 million malaria cases and an estimated 438,000 malaria deaths.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/|title=10 facts on malaria|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate is an influential driving force of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Malaria is especially susceptible to the effects of climate change because mosquitoes lack the mechanisms to regulate their internal temperature. This implies that there is a limited range of climatic conditions within which the pathogen (malaria) and vector (a mosquito) can survive, reproduce and infect hosts.&lt;ref name=infectious/&gt; Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, have distinctive characteristics that determine [[pathogenicity]]. These include the survival and reproduction rate of the vector, the level of vector activity (i.e. the biting or feeding rate), and the development and reproduction rate of the pathogen within the vector or host.&lt;ref name=infectious&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=S. |last1=Mia |first2=Rawshan A. |last2=Begum |first3=Ah-Choy |last3=Er |first4=Raja D.Z.R. Zainal |last4=Abidin |first5=Joy J. |last5=Pereira |title=Malaria and Climate Change: Discussion on Economic Impacts |journal=[[American Journal of Environmental Sciences]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=65–74 |doi=10.3844/ajessp.2011.73.82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in climate factors substantially affect reproduction, development, distribution and seasonal transmissions of malaria.

Mosquitoes have a small window for preferential conditions for breeding and maturation. The ultimate breeding and maturing temperature for mosquitoes range from sixteen to eighteen degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name= commonwealth&gt;{{cite report |last=Githeko |first=Andrew K. |title=Malaria and climate change |work=Commonwealth Health Ministers’ Update 2009/2010 |url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/44031/1/130440.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the temperature is decreased by two degrees, most of the insects will succumb to death. This is why malaria is unsustainable in places with cool winters. If a climate with an average of approximately 16 degrees Celsius experiences an increase of about two degrees, the mature bugs and the larvae flourish.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; Female mosquitoes will need more food (human/animal blood) to sustain life and to stimulate production of eggs. This increases the chance of spread of malaria due to more human contact and a higher number of the blood sucking insects surviving and living longer. Mosquitoes are also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and humidity. Increased precipitation can increase mosquito population indirectly by expanding larval habitat and food supply.&lt;ref name=infectious2&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Helen |last1=Pates |first2=Christopher |last2=Curtis |title=Mosquito Behaviour and Vector Control |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |year=2005 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.50.071803.130439 |pmid=15355233}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prime temperatures are creating large breeding grounds for the insects and places for the larvae to mature. Increased temperature is causing snow to melt and stagnant pools of water to become more common.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; Bugs that are already carrying the disease are more likely to multiply and infect other mosquitoes causing a dangerous spread of the deadly disease.

Climate change has a direct impact on people's health in places where Malaria is not prevalent. In communities of higher altitudes in [[Africa]] and [[South America]], people are at higher risk for developing malaria in recent years because of an increase temperature. Mosquitos are sensitive to temperature changes and the warming of their environment will boost their rates of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Paul R|date=2005|title=Climate Change and Human Health|url=|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 353| issue =  14|pages=1433–1436|via=|doi=10.1056/nejmp058079|pmid=16207843|pmc=2636266}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fluctuation of two or three degrees is creating exceptional breeding grounds for mosquitoes, for larvae to grow and mature mosquitoes carrying the virus to infect people that have never been exposed before.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; This is a severe problem because people in these communities have never been exposed to this disease causing an increased risk for complications from malaria such as cerebral malaria (a type of malaria that causes mental disability, paralysis and has a high mortality rate) and death by the disease.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; Residents of these communities are being hit hard by malaria because they are unfamiliar with it; they do not know the signs and symptoms and have little to no immunity.

The population at risk of malaria in the absence of climate change is projected to double between 1990 and 2080 to 8820 million, however; unmitigated climate change would, by the 2080s, further increase the population at risk of malaria by another 257 to 323 million.&lt;ref name=Goklany&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Indur M. |last1=Goklany |first2=Sir David A. |last2=King |title=Climate Change and Malaria |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=2004 |volume=306 |issue=5693 |pages=55–57 |doi=10.1126/science.306.5693.55|pmid=15459370 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231205 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, reducing the effects of climate change in the present would reduce the total by about 3.5%, saving tens of thousands of lives worldwide.

If there is a slight discrepancy in the normal temperature, the perfect conditions for the insects to multiply are created. People that have never been infected before are unknowingly at risk for this deadly disease and do not have the immunity to combat it.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; An increase in temperature has the potential to cause a widespread [[epidemic]] of the disease that has the capacity to wipe out entire populations of people. It is important to track the prevalence, species and number of insects carrying the disease as well as the number of humans infected in countries and places that have never seen malaria before. It is simple for the slightest of fluctuation in temperature to cause a catastrophic epidemic that has the possibility to end the lives of many innocent and unsuspecting people.&lt;ref name= commonwealth/&gt;

====Dengue fever====

[[Dengue fever]] is an infectious disease caused by [[dengue virus]]es known to be in the tropical regions.&lt;ref name="Dengue and Sever Dengue"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dengue and Severe Dengue, Fact Sheet |work=Media Centre |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is transmitted by the mosquito [[Aedes]], or A. aegypti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simmon |first=Cameron |last2=Farrar |first2=Jeremy J. |last3=Chau |first3=Nguyen van Vinh |last4=Wills |first4=Bridget |title=Dengue |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=12 April 2012 |volume=366 |issue=15 |pages=1423–1432 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1110265 |pmid=22494122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases of dengue fever have increased dramatically since the 1970s and it continues to become more prevalent.&lt;ref name="Dengue and Sever Dengue" /&gt; The greater incidence of this disease is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gubler |first=DJ |title=Human and Medical Virology: Dengue Viruses |editor-last1=Mahy |editor-first1=Brian W.J. |editor-last2=van Regenmortel |editor-first2=Marc H.V. |work=Desk Encyclopedia of Human and Medical Virology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsh48WKIbhQC&amp;pg=PA372 |year=2010 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-378559-6 |pages=372–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of [[dengue hemorrhagic fever]]. There are four different types of viruses in dengue fever. If someone is infected with one type of dengue virus, he or she will have permanent immunity to that type of dengue virus, but will have short term immunity to the other type of dengue fever.&lt;ref name="Dengue and Sever Dengue" /&gt; Some of the symptoms of dengue fever are fever, headache, muscle and joint pains and skin rash.&lt;ref name=denguefever&gt;{{cite web |title=Dengue Fever |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002350/ |publisher=National Institutes of Health |access-date=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no vaccine for dengue fever right now and there is no true treatment to get rid of it, but there are treatments to assist with some of the work of dengue, such as the use of oral or intravenous fluids for rehydration.&lt;ref name=denguefever/&gt;

Dengue fever used to be considered a [[tropical disease]], but [[climate change]] is causing dengue fever to spread. Dengue fever is transmitted by certain types of [[mosquitoes]], which have been spreading further and further north. This is because some of the climate changes that are occurring are increased heat, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[humidity]] which create prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA69 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotter and wetter a climate is, the faster the mosquitoes can mature and the faster the disease can develop. Another influence is the changing [[El Nino]] effects that are affecting the climate to change in different areas of the world, causing dengue fever to be able to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hopp |first=Marianne J. |last2=Foley |first2=Jonathan A. |title=Global-Scale Relationships Between Climate and the Dengue Fever Vector, Aedes Aegypti |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |date=February 2001 |volume=48 |issue=2/3 |pages=441–463 |doi=10.1023/a:1010717502442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many things that can be done, both on a governmental level and on an individual basis. One improvement would be having a better system of detecting when dengue outbreaks may happen. This can be done by monitoring environments, such as temperatures, rainfall and humidity that would be attractive to these types of mosquitoes and help them to flourish. Another useful plan is to educate the public by letting them know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves. For example, people should create a living environment that is not attractive to mosquitoes (no standing water), dress in appropriate clothing (light colours, long sleeves), and wear insect repellent.

==== Tick Borne Disease ====
A high humidity of greater than 85% is the best condition for a tick to start and finish its life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Süss|first=Jochen|last2=Klaus|first2=Christine|last3=Gerstengarbe|first3=Friedrich‐Wilhelm|last4=Werner|first4=Peter C.|date=2008-01-01|title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

More specifically, maximum temperature has been found to play the most influential variable in sustaining tick populations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Brownstein|last2=Holford|first2=Theodore|last3=Fish|first3=Durland|date=February 12, 2003|title=A Climate-Based Model Predicts the Spatial Distribution of the Lyme Disease Vector Ixodes scapularis in the United States|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241567/pdf/ehp0111-001152.pdf|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=11|pages=1152-1157|via=NCBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher temperatures augment both hatching and developmental rates while hindering overall survival. Temperature is so important to overall survival that an average monthly minimum temperature of below -7°C in the winter can prevent an area from maintaining established populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The effect of climate on the tick life cycle is one of the more difficult projections to make in relation to climate and vector-borne disease. Unlike other vectors, tick life cycles span multiple seasons as they mature from larva to nymph to adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health2016.globalchange.gov/climate-and-health-assessment/vectorborne-diseases/boxes/life-cycle-blacklegged-ticks-ixodes|title=Life Cycle of Blacklegged Ticks, Ixodes scapularis {{!}} Climate and Health Assessment|last=USGCRP|website=health2016.globalchange.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, infection and spread of diseases such as Lyme disease happens across the multiple stages adding additional variables to consider. Infection of ticks happen in the larval/nymph stage (after the first blood meal) when they are exposed to borrelia burgdorferi (the spirochete responsible for Lyme disease), but transmission to humans doesn’t occur until the adult stages. 

The expansion of tick populations are concurrent with global climatic change. Species distribution models of recent years indicate that the deer tick, known as ''I. scapularis,'' is pushing its distribution to higher latitudes of the Northeastern United States and Canada, as well as pushing and maintaining populations in the South Central and Northern Midwest regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esteve-Gassent|first=Maria D.|last2=Castro-Arellano|first2=Ivan|last3=Feria-Arroyo|first3=Teresa P.|last4=Patino|first4=Ramiro|last5=Li|first5=Andrew Y.|last6=Medina|first6=Raul F.|last7=Pérez de León|first7=Adalberto A.|last8=Rodríguez-Vivas|first8=Roger Iván|date=May 2016|title=Translating ecology, physiology, biochemistry and population genetics research to meet the challenge of tick and tick-borne diseases in North America|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4844827/|journal=Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=38–64|doi=10.1002/arch.21327|issn=0739-4462|pmc=4844827|pmid=27062414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate models project further expansion of tick habit north into Canada as progressing Northwest from the Northeastern United States.

Tick populations are not only spreading wider, but moving to higher elevations. In Colorado, the Rocky Mountain wood tick known as ''D. andersoni'' is found along the front range and is want to feed, and consequently infect, human populations with tularemia (''Francisella tularensis''), Rocky Mountain spotted fever (''Rickettsia rickettsii''), and Colorado tick fever (CTF virus). A case study testing climatic interaction affecting tick vector (''D. andersoni'') populations in Larimer County, Colorado indicated that an estimated increase of 1.2–2.0 °C in summer temperatures would increase tick populations moving 100m upwards in elevation, increasing the range and susceptibility of tick-borne illnesses along the front range.

Initial symptoms of tick-borne infections are generally quite similar to that of other viral illnesses. This includes fever, headache, fatigue, and general malaise. This group of diseases can further be difficult to distinguish early on in the disease process due to these general symptoms in addition to most people (reported around 75%) not realizing they have been bitten or exposed to the tick vector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadelman|first=Robert B.|last2=Nowakowski|first2=John|last3=Forseter|first3=Gilda|last4=Goldberg|first4=Neil S.|last5=Bittker|first5=Susan|last6=Cooper|first6=Denise|last7=Aguero-Rosenfeld|first7=Maria|last8=Wormser|first8=Gary P.|date=May 1996|title=The clinical spectrum of early lyme borreliosis in patients with culture-confirmed erythema migrans|url=https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(95)99915-9/pdf|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|language=English|volume=100|issue=5|pages=502–508|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(95)99915-9|issn=0002-9343|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique to early Lyme disease is the development of the classic erythema migrans skin rash, also known as the “bull’s eye” or “target” rash, which occurs in about 80% of people diagnosed with Lyme disease.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steere|first=Allen C.|last2=Sikand|first2=Vijay K.|date=2003-06-12|title=The Presenting Manifestations of Lyme Disease and the Outcomes of Treatment|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM200306123482423?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=348|issue=24|pages=2472–2474|doi=10.1056/nejm200306123482423|issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symptom can be an important distinguishing factor helping to make the diagnosis early. If Lyme disease is unrecognized, misdiagnosed, or improperly treated it can lead to much more severe and serious consequences with the spread of the spirochete to joints, heart, and nervous system causing arthritis, carditis, cranial nerve palsies or encephalopathy and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Regardless of the specific diagnosis (Lyme, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Colorado Tick Fever, Babesiosis etc.) the key to management and prevention of sequelae is early identification of disease and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. With regard to the effects of a warming world and the expansion of tick populations to previously unexposed areas, adaptive keys to prevention will include expansion of health care infrastructure and pharmacologic availability, as well as education of people and providers as to the risks of disease and preventative measures they can take.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap15_FINAL.pdf|title=Climate Change 2014: Impacts,Adaptation, and Vulnerability|last=Mimura|first=Nobuo|last2=Pulwarty|first2=Roger|last3=Duc|first3=Do Minh|last4=Elshinnawy|first4=Ibrahim|last5=Redsteer|first5=Margaret|last6=Huang|first6=He-Qing|last7=Nkem|first7=Johnson|last8=Sanchez Rodriguez|first8=Roberto|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA|pages=869-898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of these expanding threats, strong collaboration between government officials and environmental scientists is necessary for advancing preventative and reactive response measures. Without acknowledging the climate changes that make environments more habitable for disease carriers, policy and infrastructure will lag behind vector borne disease spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2018/08/06/21999/disease-bearing-ticks-head-north-weak-government-response-threatens-public-health|title=As disease-bearing ticks head north, weak government response threatens public health|work=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human cost associated with denying climate change science is one that concerns many governments.

===Impact on mental health{{anchor|Mental_health}}===
While the physical health impacts of [[climate change]] are well known, the impact on [[mental health]] has only begun to be recognized in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chand |first1=Prabhat Kumar |last2=Murthy |first2=Pratima |title=Climate change and mental health |journal=Regional Health Forum |year=2008 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pp=43–48 |url=http://www.uncclearn.org/sites/default/files/inventory/who44.pdf#page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2011 in ''[[American Psychologist]]'' Clayton &amp; Doherty, concluded that global climate change is bound to have substantial negative impacts on mental health and wellbeing, effects which will primarily be felt by vulnerable [[populations]] and those with pre-existing serious [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name=clayton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doherty |first1=Susan |last2=Clayton |first2=Thomas J |title=The psychological impacts of global climate change |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |year=2011 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1037/a0023141 |pmid=21553952 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/66/4/265/|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.8333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research done by Berry, Bowen, and Kjellstrom in 2008 found that climate change exposes populations to [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], which negatively impacts mental health in very serious ways.&lt;ref name=berry&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=Helen|last2=Kathryn|first2=Bowen|last3=Kjellstrom|first3=Tord|title=Climate change and mental health: a causal pathways framework|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=55|issue=2|pages=123–132|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00038-009-0112-0.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-0112-0|pmid=20033251|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the Clayton study and the Berry study identify three classes of psychological impacts from global climate change: direct, indirect, and psychosocial.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt;&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; The Clayton study claims that in order to appreciate these impacts on psychological wellbeing, a basic understanding of certain aspects is required. One must recognize the multiple meanings and cultural narratives associated with climate change, as well as how climate change, global phenomena like increased population, are interrelated. Climate change does not impact everyone equally; those of lower [[economic]] and social status are at greater risk and experience more devastating impacts.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; A 2018 study of CDC data connected temperature rise to increased numbers of suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/817731002|publisher=USA Today|year=2018|title=Global warming risk: Rising temperatures from climate change linked to rise in suicides}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study revealed that hotter days could increase suicide rates and could cause approximately 26,000 more suicides in the U.S. by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/high-temperatures-cause-suicide-rates-to-increase/565826/|title=Climate Change May Cause 26,000 More U.S. Suicides by 2050|website=The Atlantic|date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Direct impacts====
Direct impacts on mental health happen when a [[community]] experiences [[extreme weather]] and changed [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; 
Direct impacts like landscape changes, impaired [[place attachment]], and [[psychological trauma]] are all immediate and localized problems resulting from extreme weather events and environmental changes.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Extreme weather events cause negative changes to landscape and [[agriculture]]. This leads to communities facing economic aspects, especially for communities that use agriculture as a main source of income. After economic fall, communities face loss of livelihoods and [[poverty]]. Many communities will also face isolation, alienation, [[grief]], bereavement, and displacement from these effects.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;&lt;ref name=portier&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health and Stress-Related Disorders |url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |work=National Institute of Environment Health Services |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |date=1 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421191355/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |archivedate=21 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals will have an increased rate of [[anxiety]] and emotional stress. The rate of effects on mental health increases in already-vulnerable communities.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; Clayton reinforces that the more powerful the extreme weather event, and the more frequent these weather events are, the more damage is done to the mental health of the community.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt;
Some of the extreme weather events responsible for these mental health changes include wildfires,&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods,&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; and extreme heat.&lt;ref name=worldhealth&gt;{{cite web|last1=World Health Organization|title=Climate change and health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indirect impacts====
Indirect impacts on mental health occur via impacts on physical health and community wellbeing. Physical health and mental health have a reciprocal relationship.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; If the physical health of an individual is negatively impacted, the decline in mental health will soon follow.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; These impacts are more gradual and cumulative. They are threats to emotional wellbeing through concern and uncertainly about future risks.&lt;ref name="clayton"/&gt; They are also large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to [[Human migration|migration]] and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Extreme weather events play a major role here; their impacts can be indirect, not just direct.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; This is due to the effect on physical health from extreme weather events. Each extreme weather event effects humans in different ways, but they all lead to the decline of mental health.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;
[[Heat]] indirectly causes mental health issues through physical health issues. The World Health Organization presents the fact that high extreme heat is directly related to certain ailments like [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], and [[asthma]]. One piece of their evidence is that in summer 2003, during Europe's big heat wave, there were 70,000 recorded deaths related to the heat.&lt;ref name=worldhealth/&gt; Heat exhaustion also occurs during extreme heat. As climate change continues, heat will continue to rise and these problems will exacerbate. These physical problems lead to mental health problems. As physical health worsens and is less curable, mental stability starts to deteriorate.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;

As extreme heat makes landscapes dry, nature is more prone to fire. Research shows that rising heat due to climate change has caused an increase in fires around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westerling|first1=Anthony|title=Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring|url=http://ulmo.ucmerced.edu/pdffiles/16RSTB_Westerling.pdf|publisher=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burn]]s and smoke inhalation from the increasing number of fires lead to a decline in physical health, which leads to mental health problems. Deaths of family and friends cause individuals to suffer from stress and other conditions. Many suffering from loss of family and friends will internalize their emotions, feel extreme guilt and helplessness, and become paranoid. Others will develop fear of future loss and have an overall displacement of feelings that could last for years.&lt;ref name=bowlby&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lorna|first1=Bowlby-West|title=The impact of death on the family system|journal=Journal of Family Therapy|volume=5|issue=3|pages=279–294|doi=10.1046/j..1983.00623.x|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson published research in the American Psychological Association that shows the increase in murders in the United States directly correlates with the temperature increase. For every one-degree [[Fahrenheit]], there will be nine more murders in the country, which leads to an additional 24,000 murders or assaults per year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2000-2004/01A.pdf|title=Heat and Violence|last=Anderson|first=C|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2001|isbn=|location=Iowa|pages=33–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an increased risk in [[suicide]] in communities that suffer from extreme weather events. Studies show that suicide rates increase after extreme weather events. This is evidence for the decline in mental health.&lt;ref name=epstein&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased suicide risk has been demonstrated in [[Australia]], where [[drought]] has resulted in [[crop]] failures and despair to the Australian countryside. After the event, farmers were left with almost nothing. They were forced to sell their belongings, reduce their stock, and borrow large sums of money to plant crops at the start of the next season.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; These consequences have caused a growing increase in [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[domestic violence]], and suicide. More than one hundred farmers in the Australian countryside had committed suicide by 2007.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; An individual's suicide often leads to mental health problems of loved ones. They face issues like those who have lost loved ones due to fire: grief, sadness, anger, [[paranoia]], and others.&lt;ref name=bowlby/&gt;

Some impacts pertaining to mental health are even more gradual and cumulative than the others, like [[Social relation|social interaction]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[communication]].&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; The social interaction between communities and within communities is greatly affected by migration. Communities choose to migrate, or are forced to migrate, due to stressors on limited resources. This is worsened by extreme weather events caused by climate change.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; Common mental health conditions associated indirectly from these extreme weather events include [[Acute stress reaction|acute traumatic stress]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[complicated grief]], [[anxiety disorders]], sleep difficulties, and [[sexual dysfunction]]. [[Substance abuse|Drug abuse]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] are also common aftereffects, and can lead to both physical and mental issues, [[addiction]] and substance reliance being the most common.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt;

The effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a past extreme weather event in [[New Orleans]], lead to a variety of mental health problems due to the destruction of resources&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; Many people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were left [[homeless]], disenfranchised, stressed, and suffering physical illness. This strain on the [[public health]] system decreased access and availability of medical resources.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; Some [[climate change adaptation]] measures may prevent the need for displacement. However, some communities may be unable to implement adaptation strategies, and this will create added stress, further exacerbating already existing mental health issues.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt;  Extreme weather events and population displacement lead to limited availability of [[medications]], one of the primary resources required to meet psychological and physical needs of those affected by such events. Less medication and medical resources means fewer people can get the help they need to recover. Slowed recovery and lack of recovery worsen overall mental health.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt;

====Psychological impacts====
Psychological impacts are the effects that heat, [[drought]], migrations, and climate-related conflicts have on social life and community life. This includes post-disaster adjustment.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Most of these effects are indirect instead of direct, but Clayton and Berry place them in a separate category because they deal with the relationships within a community.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Many of the results are from how people use and occupy territory.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Human migration of large communities causes discord within those communities because the already scarce resources are even more limited during migration.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; Agriculture and aquaculture are severely impacted by the extreme weather events of climate change, the suitability of territory being the most notable kind of change.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; During and after migration, the geographical distribution of populations is altered.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Children and parents may be separated at these times. The early separation of kids from their parents can cause symptoms of grieving, depression, and detachment in both the young and old.&lt;ref name=bowlby/&gt; The loss in resources can also lead to inter-community violence and aggression. Two groups may fight over remaining [[natural resources]]. A community may choose to migrate to find better resources, and encroach on another community's territory, either accidentally or purposefully.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Civil unrest can occur when [[governments]] fail to adequately protect communities against the extreme weather events that cause these effects. When this happens, individuals lose confidence and trust in their government. A loss in trust can be the beginning of oncoming mental health problems.&lt;ref name=bowlby/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Abbott |first=Chris |title=An Uncertain Future: Law Enforcement, National Security and Climate Change |publisher=Oxford Research Group |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/uncertainfuture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disruption of a community when they are forced to relocate results in the deterioration of geographic and social connections. This leads to grief, anxiety, and an overall sense of loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Donald R. |last2=West |first2=Colin Thor |last3=Finan |first3=Timothy J. |title=Introduction to "In focus: Global change and adaptation in local places." |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |date=September 2009 |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=271–274 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01131.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change and permafrost==
[[Permafrost]] is an important part of our environment and plays an important role in maintaining the stability of many ecosystems around the world.  
===Soil sustainability===
Permafrost is integral to soil stability in arctic regions.&lt;ref name="Task Force"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hinkel |first=Kenneth M |first2=Frederick E. |last2=Nelson |first3=Walter |last3=Parker |first4=Vladimir |last4=Romanovsky |first5=Orson |last5=Smith |first6=Walter |last6=Tucker |first7=Ted |last7=Vinson |first8=Lawson W. |last8=Brigham |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change, Permafrost, and Impacts on Civil Infrastructure |journal=U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force |year=2003 |pages=1–61 |url=http://www.arctic.gov/publications/other/permafrost.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112164129/http://www.arctic.gov/publications/other/permafrost.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melting permafrost causes the surrounding soil to become unstable and settle.&lt;ref name="Task Force" /&gt; Settlement of surface soil associated with melting permafrost leads to significant infrastructure instability and damage to roads, bridges, buildings, homes, pipelines and airstrips in affected areas.&lt;ref name="Task Force" /&gt;

==Impact on natural resources==

===Drinking water===
In rural Africa and the Middle East, when droughts dry up the regular water supply, rural and impoverished families are forced to resort to drinking the dirty, sediment-and-parasite-laden water that sits in puddles and small pools on the surface of the earth. Many are aware of the presence of contamination, but will drink from these sources nonetheless in order to avoid dying of dehydration. It has been estimated that up to 80% of human illness in the world can be attributed to contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalwater.org/background.htm |title=Water Shortage, Drinking Water Crisis Solutions |work=globalwater.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124043427/http://globalwater.org/background.htm |archivedate=2012-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is an adequate amount of drinking water, humans drink from different sources than their livestock. However, when drought occurs and drinking water slowly disappears, catchment areas such as streams and depressions in the ground where water gathers are often shared between people and the livestock they depend on for financial and nutritional support, and this is when humans can fall seriously ill. Although some diseases that are transferred to humans can be prevented by boiling the water, many people, living on just a litre or two of water per day, refuse to boil, as it loses a certain percentage of the water to steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reports: Drought-Stricken Somalis Dying From Contaminated Water |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=31 October 2009 |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2006-03-22-voa28/324586.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sharing of water between livestock and humans is one of the most common factors in the transmission of non-tuberulosis mycobacteria (NTM). NTM is carried in cattle and pig feces, and if this contaminates the drinking water supply, it can result in pulmonary disease, disseminated disease or localized lesions in humans with both compromised and competent immune systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Clovice |last1=Kankya |first2=Adrian |last2=Muwonge |first3=Berit |last3=Djønne |first4=Musso |last4=Munyeme |first5=John |last5=Opuda-Asibo |first6=Eystein |last6=Skjerve |first7=James |last7=Oloya |first8=Vigdis |last8=Edvardsen |first9=Tone B |last9=Johansen |display-authors=3 |title=Isolation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria from pastoral ecosystems of Uganda: Public Health significance |journal=BMC Public Health |date=16 May 2011 |volume=11 |issue=320 |pp=1–9 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-11-320 |pmid=21575226 |pmc=3123205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During drought, water supplies are even more susceptible to harmful algal blooms and microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/health/climate/drought.asp |title=NRDC: Climate Change Threatens Health: Drought |work=nrdc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Algal blooms increase water turbidity, suffocating aquatic plants, and can deplete oxygen, killing fish. Some kinds of blue-green algae create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. During times of intense precipitation (such as during the “wet season” in much of the tropical and sub-tropical world, including Australia and Panama), nutrients that cyanobacteria depend on are carried from groundwater and the earth's surface into bodies of water. As drought begins and these bodies gradually dry up, the nutrients are concentrated, providing the perfect opportunity for algal blooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hans W. |last1=Paerl |first2=Jef |last2=Huisman |title=Blooms Like It Hot |journal=Science |date=4 April 2008 |volume=320 |issue=5872 |pages=57–58 |doi=10.1126/science.1155398 |pmid=18388279 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5872/57|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.6826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria) Blooms |work=California Department of Public Health |date=18 September 2013 |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/environhealth/water/pages/bluegreenalgae.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Faces Era Of Water Scarcity |work=WaterNews |publisher=Circle of Blue |date=9 July 2008 |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2008/world/us-faces-era-of-water-scarcity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fresh water===
As the climate warms, it changes the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, stream flow and other factors that affect water supply and quality. [[Freshwater]] resources are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate. Climate change is projected to affect water availability.  In areas where the amount of water in rivers and streams depends on snow melting, warmer temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, causing the annual spring peak in water runoff to occur earlier in the year. This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter [[flood]]ing and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh [[underground water]] and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming. Warmer water temperatures also affect water quality and accelerate [[water pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Miller |title=Climate Change Impacts on Water |work=Climate Change and Water Research |publisher=Institute for the Study of Society and Environment (ISSE) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research |access-date=12 August 2016 |url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on livestock==
Climate change is beginning to lead the global population into a food shortage, greatly affecting our [[livestock]] supply. Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a [[feedback loop]]. [[Greenhouse gases]], specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.

===Greenhouse gas effects===
Our agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |title=The Food Gap: The Impacts of Climate Change on Food Production: a 2020 Perspective |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416214231/http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strategies&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Sharon |last1=Friel |first2=Alan D. |last2=Dangour |first3=Tara |last3=Garnett |first4=Karen |last4=Lock |first5=Zaid |last5=Chalabi |first6=Ian |last6=Roberts |first7=Ainslie |last7=Butler |first8=Colin D. |last8=Butler |first9=Jeff |last9=Waage |first10=Anthony J. |last10=McMichael |first11=Andy |last11=Haines |display-authors=3 |title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture |journal=The Lancet |year=2009 |volume=374 |issue=9706 |pages=2016–2025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0|pmid=19942280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[IPCC]], it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%. More specifically, emissions from farms, such as [[nitrous oxide]], [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]], are the main culprits, and can be held accountable for up to half of the greenhouse-gases produced by the overall food industry, or 80% of all emissions just within agriculture.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

The types of farm animals, as well as the food they supply can be put into two categories: [[monogastric]] and [[ruminant]]. Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions. This is due to the fact that these types of animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce any methane.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

As lower-income countries begin, and continue, to develop, the necessity for a consistent meat supply will increase.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=P.K. |last1=Thornton |first2=J. |last2=van de Steeg |first3=A. |last3=Notenbaert |first4=M. |last4=Herrero |title=The impacts of climate change on livestock and livestock systems in developing countries: A review of what we know and what we need to know |journal=Agricultural Systems |year=2009 |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=113–127 |doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2009.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the cattle population will be required to grow in order to keep up with the demand, producing the highest possible rate of greenhouse-gas emissions.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

There are many strategies that can be used to help soften the effects, and the further production of greenhouse-gas emissions. Some of these strategies include a higher efficiency in livestock farming, which includes management, as well as technology; a more effective process of managing manure; a lower dependence upon fossil-fuels and nonrenewable resources; a variation in the animals' eating and drinking duration, time and location; and a cutback in both the production and consumption of animal-sourced foods.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kurukulasuriya |first2=Shane |last2=Rosenthal |title=Climate Change and Agriculture: A Review of Impacts and Adaptions |publisher=[[World Bank]] |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~c-ciarn/documents/World_Bank_Paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite report |first1=A.J. |last1=McMichael |first2=D.H. |last2=Campbell-Lendrum |first3=C.F. |last3=Corvalán |first4=K.L. |last4=Ebi |first5=A.K. |last5=Githeko |first6=J.D. |last6=Scheraga |first7=A. |last7=Woodward |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2003 |isbn=92 4 156248 X |url=http://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/climchange.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat stress===
[[Heat stress]] on livestock has a devastating effect on not only their growth and reproduction, but their food intake and production of dairy and meat. Cattle require a temperature range of 5-15 degrees Celsius, but upwards to 25&amp;nbsp;°C, to live comfortably, and once climate change increases the temperature, the chance of these changes occurring increases.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; Once the high temperatures hit, the livestock struggle to keep up their metabolism, resulting in decreased food intake, lowered activity rate, and a drop in weight. This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the [[tropics]], of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.

==Impact on plant based food==
[[Climate change]] has many potential impacts on the production of food crops—from [[food scarcity]] and nutrient deficiency to possible increased food production because of elevated [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] levels—all of which directly affect [[human health]]. Part of this variability in possible outcomes is from the various [[climate change model]]s used to project potential impacts; each model takes into account different factors and so come out with a slightly different result.&lt;ref name=Hertel&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hertel |first=Thomas W. |last2=Rosch |first2=Stephanie D. |title=Climate Change, Agriculture, and Poverty |journal=[[Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy]] |date=June 2010 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=355–385 |doi=10.1093/aepp/ppq016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second problem comes from the fact that projections are made based on historical data which is not necessarily helpful in accurate forecasting as changes are occurring exponentially.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kul&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kulshreshtha |first=Surendra N. |title=Climate Change, Prairie Agriculture and Prairie Economy: The new normal |journal=Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics |date=March 2011 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=19–44 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-7976.2010.01211.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there are many different possible impacts—both positive and negative—that may result from climate change affecting global regions in different ways.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite report |editor-first1=Donald S. |editor-last1=Lemmen |editor-first2=Fiona J. |editor-last2=Warren |title=Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: A Canadian Perspective |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=2004 |isbn= 0-662-33123-0 |url=http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/27428.pdf}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food scarcity===
Food scarcity is a major key for many populations and is one of the prominent concerns with the changing climate. Currently, 1/6 of the [[global population]] are without adequate food supply.&lt;ref name=Beddington&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beddington |first=John R. |last2=Asaduzzaman |first2=Mohammed |last3=Clark |first3=Megan E. |last4=Bremauntz |first4=Adrian Fernández |last5=Guillou |first5=Marion D |last6=Jahn |first6=Molly M. |last7=Lin |first7=Erda |last8=Mamo |first8=Tekalign |last9=Negra |first9=Christine |last10=Nobre |first10=Carlos A. |last11=Scholes |first11=Robert J. |last12=Sharma |first12=Rita |last13=Van Bo |first13=Nguyen |last14=Wakhungu |first14=Judi |display-authors=3 |title=The role for scientists in tackling food insecurity and climate change |journal=Agriculture &amp; Food Security |year=2012 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=10 |doi=10.1186/2048-7010-1-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, the global population is projected to reach 9 billion requiring global food productions to increase by 50% to meet population demand.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chakraborty |first=S. |last2=Newton |first2=A.

===Extreme weather===

====Rising temperatures====
As the [[temperature]] changes and weather patterns become more extreme, areas which were historically good for farmland will no longer be as amicable.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connor |first=Jeffery D. |last2=Schwabe |first2=Kurt |last3=King |first3=Darran |last4=Knapp |first4=Keith |title=Irrigated agriculture and climate change: The influence of water supply variability and salinity on adaptation |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |date=May 2012 |volume=77 |pages=149–157 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sindhu |first=J.S. |title=Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture |journal=Indian Journal of Science and Technology |date=March 2011 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=348–353 |issn=0974-6846 |url=http://www.indjst.org/index.php/indjst/article/view/29998/25953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current prediction is for temperature increase and precipitation decrease for major [[arid]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions ([[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Southwest United States]], and [[Southern Europe]]).&lt;ref name=Connor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tubiello&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tubiello |first=Francesco N. |last2=Rosenzweig |first2=Cynthia |title=Developing climate change impact metrics for agriculture |journal=The Integrated Assessment Journal |year=2008 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pp=165–184 |url=http://journals.sfu.ca/int_assess/index.php/iaj/article/viewFile/276/240}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, crop yields in [[tropical regions]] will be negatively affected by the projected moderate increase in temperature (1-2&amp;nbsp;°C) expected to occur during the first half of the century.&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Soussana"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tubiello |first=Francesco N. |last2=Soussana |first2=Jean-François |first3= S.

There are, however, some positive possible aspects to climate change as well. The projected increase in temperature during the first half of the century (1-3&amp;nbsp;°C) is expected to benefit crop and pasture yields in the [[temperate region]]s.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Van der Velde"&gt;{{cite report |last=Tubiello |first=F.N. |last2=van der Velde |first2=M. |title=Land and water use options for climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture |work=SOLAW Background Thematic Report - TR04A |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/solaw/files/thematic_reports/TR_04a_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will lead to higher winter temperatures and more frost-free days in these regions; resulting in a longer [[growing season]], increased thermal resources and accelerated maturation.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt; If the climate scenario results in mild and wet weather, some areas and crops will suffer, but many may benefit from this.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;

====Drought and flood====
Extreme weather conditions continue to decrease crop yields in the form of [[droughts]] and [[floods]]. While these weather events are becoming more common, there is still uncertainty and therefore a lack of preparedness as to when and where they will take place.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kristjanson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kristjanson |first=Patti |last2=Neufeldt |first2=Henry |last3=Gassner |first3=Anja |last4=Mango |first4=Joash |last5=Kyazze |first5=Florence B. |last6=Desta |first6=Solomon |last7=Sayula |first7=George |last8=Thiede |first8=Brian |last9=Förch |first9=Wiebke |last10=Thornton |first10=Pphilip K. |last11=Coe |first11=Richard |display-authors=3 |title=Are food insecure smallholder households making changes in their farming practices? Evidence from East Africa |journal=Food Security |year=2012 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=381–397 |doi=10.1007/s12571-012-0194-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, floods destroy crops, disrupting agricultural activities and rendering workers jobless and eliminating food supply. On the opposite end of the spectrum, droughts can also wipe out crops. It is estimated that 35-50% of the world's crops are at risk of drought.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; [[Drought in Australia|Australia]] has been experiencing severe, recurrent droughts for a number of years, bringing serious despair to its farmers. The country's rates of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[domestic violence]] are increasing and as of 2007, more than one hundred farmers had committed suicide as their thirsty crops slipped away.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; Drought is even more disastrous in the [[developing world]], exacerbating the pre-existing [[poverty]] and fostering [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt;

Droughts can cause farmers to rely more heavily on [[irrigation]]; this has downsides for both the individual farmers and the consumers. The equipment is expensive to install and some farmers may not have the financial ability to purchase it.&lt;ref name=Connor/&gt; The water itself must come from somewhere and if the area has been in a drought for any length of time, the rivers may be dry and the water must be transported from further distances. With 70% of “blue water” currently being used for global agriculture, any need over and above this could potentiate a [[water crisis]].&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;  In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], water is used to flood [[rice fields]] to control the weed population; with the projection of less precipitation for this area, this [[historical method]] of weed control will no longer be possible.&lt;ref name=Rod10&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=Jonne |last2=Riches |first2=Charles R. |last3=Kayeke |first3=Juma M. |title=Addressing current and future problems of parasitic weeds in rice |journal=Crop Protection |year=2010 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=210–221 |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2009.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more costs to the farmer, some will no longer find it financially feasible to farm. [[Agriculture]] employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt; Other farmers will respond by raising their food prices; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;

===Financial===
Some research suggests that initially climate change will help developing nations because some regions will be experiencing more negative climate change effects which will result in increased demand for food leading to higher prices and increased wages.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt; However, many of the projected [[climate change scenario|climate scenarios]] suggest a huge financial burden. For example, the [[2003 European heat wave|heat wave that passed through Europe in 2003]] cost 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Soussana"/&gt; In addition, during [[El Nino]] weather conditions, the chance of the Australian farmer's income falling below average increased by 75%, greatly impacting the country's [[GDP]].&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Soussana"/&gt; The agriculture industry in [[India]] makes up 52% of their employment and the [[Canadian Prairies]] supply 51% of Canadian agriculture; any changes in the production of food crops from these areas could have profound effects on the [[economy]].&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt; This could negatively affect the affordability of food and the subsequent health of the population.

===Pests and pathogens===
Currently, {{CO2}} levels are 40% higher than they were in [[pre-industrial agriculture|pre-industrial]] times.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; This diminishes nutritional content for both human and insect consumption. Studies have shown that when {{CO2}} levels rise, [[soybean]] leaves are less nutritious; therefore plant-eating beetles have to eat more to get their required [[nutrients]].&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; In addition, soybeans are less capable of defending themselves against the predatory insects under high {{CO2}}. The {{CO2}} diminishes the plant's [[jasmonic acid]] production, an insect-killing poison that is excreted when the plant senses it's being attacked. Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species’ defense mechanisms are impaired in a high {{CO2}} environment.&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;

Currently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt; Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off [[insects]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like [[soybean rust]] to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the [[Mountain Pine Beetle]] epidemic in [[BC, Canada]] which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.&lt;ref name=Rod11&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=J. |last2=Meinke |first2=H. |last3=Johnson |first3=D. E. |title=Challenges for weed management in African rice systems in a changing climate |journal=[[The Journal of Agricultural Science]] |date=August 2011 |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=427–435 |doi=10.1017/S0021859611000207|url=http://ecite.utas.edu.au/69596 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite end of the spectrum, drought conditions favour different kinds of pests like [[aphids]], [[whiteflies]] and [[locusts]].&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt;

The competitive balance between plants and pests has been relatively stable for the past century, but with the rapidly shifting climate, there is a change in this balance which often favours the more biologically diverse [[weed]]s over the [[monocropping|monocrops]] most farms consist of.&lt;ref name=Rod11/&gt; Currently, weeds claim about one tenth of global crop yields annually as there are about eight to ten weed species in a field competing with crops.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; Characteristics of weeds such as their [[genetic diversity]], cross-breeding ability, and fast-growth rates put them at an advantage in changing climates as these characteristics allow them to adapt readily in comparison to most farm's uniform crops, and give them a biological advantage.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; There is also a shift in the distribution of pests as the altered climate makes areas previously uninhabitable more uninviting.&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; Finally, with the increased {{CO2}} levels, [[herbicides]] will lose their efficiency which in turn increases the tolerance of weeds to herbicides.&lt;ref name=Rod11/&gt;

==Impact on nutrition==
	Another area of concern is the effect of climate change on the nutritional content of food for human consumption. Studies show that increasing atmospheric levels of {{CO2}} have an unfavourable effect on the nutrients in plants. As the [[carbon]] concentration in the plant's tissues increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the concentration of [[Chemical element|elements]] such as [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[zinc]] and [[iodine]]. Of significant concern is the [[protein]] content of plants, which also decreases in relation to elevating carbon content.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects of CO2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taub |first=Daniel R. |last2=Miller |first2=Brian |last3=Allen |first3=Holly |title=Effects of elevated {{CO2}} on the protein concentration of food crops: a meta-analysis |journal=[[Global Change Biology]] |date=March 2008 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=565–575 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01511.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Irakli Loladze explains that the lack of [[essential nutrients]] in crops contributes the problem of [[micronutrient malnutrition]] in society, commonly known as “hidden hunger”; despite adequate caloric intake, the body still is not nutritionally satisfied and therefore continues to be “hungry”.&lt;ref name=Loladze&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loladze |first=Irakli |title=Rising atmospheric {{CO2}} and human nutrition: toward globally imbalanced plant stoichiometry? |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=1 October 2002 |volume=17 |pages=457–461 |issue=10 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(02)02587-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is aggravated by the rising cost of food, resulting in a global shift towards diets which are less expensive, but high in [[calories]], [[fat]]s, and animal products. This results in [[undernutrition]] and an increase in [[obesity]] and diet-related [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loladze/&gt;
	
Countries worldwide are already impacted by deficiencies in micronutrients and are seeing the effects in the health of their populations. [[Iron deficiency]] affects more than 3.5 billion people; increasing [[maternal mortality]] and hindering [[cognitive development]] in children, leading to education losses. [[Iodine deficiency]] leads to ailments like [[goitre]], [[brain damage]] and [[cretinism]] and is a problem in at least 130 different countries.&lt;ref name=Loladze/&gt; Even though these deficiencies are invisible, they have great potential to impact human health on a global scale.
	
It must also be noted that small increases in {{CO2}} levels can cause a {{CO2}} fertilization effect where the growth and reproduction abilities of [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] plants such as soybeans and [[rice]] are actually enhanced by 10-20% in laboratory experiments. This does not take into account, however, the additional burden of pests, pathogens, nutrients and water affecting the crop yield.&lt;ref name="Effects of CO2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=Peter J. |last2=Johnson |first2=Scott N. |last3=Newton |first3=Adrian C. |last4=Ingram |first4=John S.I. |title=Integrating pests and pathogens into the climate change/food security debate |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |year=2009 |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=2827–2838 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp080|pmid=19380424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation and mitigation strategies==
While researchers acknowledge there are possible [[benefits of global warming]], most agree that the negative consequences of climate change will outweigh any potential benefits and instead the shifting climate will result in more benefits to developed countries and more detriments to developing countries; exacerbating the discrepancy between wealthy and impoverished nations.&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer &amp; Shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;  By thoughtful and proactive efforts, climate change can be mitigated by addressing these issues with a [[multidisciplinary approach]] that works on a [[Earth|global]], [[nation]]al and [[community]] basis that recognizes the uniqueness of each country's situation.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt; 
	
According to a study of [[East Africa]]’s smallholder farms, impacts of climate change on agriculture are already being seen there resulting in changes to farming practices such as [[intercropping]], crop, soil, land, water and livestock management systems, and introduction of new technologies and seed varieties by some of the farmers.&lt;ref name="Kristjanson"/&gt; Some other suggestions such as eliminating [[supply chain]] and household food waste, encouraging diverse and vegetable-rich diets, and providing global access to foods ([[food aid]] programs) have been suggested as ways to adapt.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt; Many researchers agree that agricultural innovation is essential to addressing the potential issues of climate change. This includes better management of soil, water-saving technology, matching crops to environments, introducing different crop varieties, crop rotations, appropriate [[fertilization]] use, and supporting community-based adaptation strategies.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rod11/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFPRI&gt;{{cite report |last=Nelson |first=Gerald C. |first2=Mark W. |last2=Rosegrant |first3=Jawoo |last3=Koo |first4=Richard |last4=Robertson |first5=Timothy |last5=Sulser |first6=Tingju |last6=Zhu |first7=Claudia |last7=Ringler |first8=Siwa |last8=Msangi |first9=Amanda |last9=Palazzo |first10=Miroslav |last10=Batka |first11=Marilia |last11=Magalhaes |first12=Rowena |last12=Valmonte-Santos |first13=Mandy |last13=Ewing |first14=David |last14=Lee |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation |publisher=[[International Food Policy Research Institute]] |date= October 2009 |location=Washington, DC |url=http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/16557/filename/16558.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a government and global level, research and investments into [[agricultural productivity]] and [[infrastructure]] must be done to get a better picture of the issues involved and the best methods to address them. [[Government policies]] and programs must provide environmentally sensitive government [[subsidies]], educational campaigns and economic incentives as well as funds, [[insurance]] and safety nets for vulnerable populations.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFPRI/&gt;  In addition, providing [[early warning systems]], and accurate [[weather forecasts]] to poor or remote areas will allow for better preparation; by using and sharing the available technology, the global issue of climate change can be addressed and mitigated by the global community.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;

==Oceans and human health==

===Overview===
Perhaps one of the most recent adverse [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] to be explored is that of [[ocean acidification]]. Our [[oceans]] cover approximately 71 percent of the [[Earth]]'s surface and support a diverse range of [[ecosystems]], which are home to over 50 percent of all the [[species]] on the planet.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web |title=Oceans &amp; Coasts |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.noaa.gov/oceans-coasts |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans regulate [[climate]] and [[weather]] as well as providing [[nutrition]] for a vast variety of species, humans included.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; Covering such an extensive part of the planet has allowed the oceans to absorb a large portion of the [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] from the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=raven99&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Raven |first=J.A. |last2=Falkowski |first2=P.G. |date=June 1999 |title=Oceanic sinks for atmospheric {{co2}} |journal=[[Plant, Cell &amp; Environment]] | volume=22 | issue=6 | pages=741–755 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00419.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is part of the [[carbon cycle]] in which the fluxes of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in Earth's [[atmosphere]], [[biosphere]] and [[lithosphere]] are described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carbon Cycle |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=29 Nov 2012 |url=http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9020247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have drastically added to the amount of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in the atmosphere through the burning of [[fossil fuels]] and the process of [[deforestation]]. Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). As the oceans absorb [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) it breaks down into [[carbonic acid]], a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally [[alkaline]] ocean water. As a result, the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of {{CO2}} before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from [[extreme weather]] patterns and [[food scarcity]] to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect [[human health]].

===Coral===
With degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.&lt;ref name="atoll"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=James|last2=Chui|first2=Ting Fong May|date=May 2012|title=Evaluating the fate of freshwater lenses on atoll islands after eustatic sea-level rise and cyclone driven inundation: A modelling approach|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=88–89|pages=76–84|bibcode=2012GPC....88...76T|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="child"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Aneire Ehmar|last2=Ireson|first2=Andrew|last3=Kovats|first3=Sari|last4=Mojumder|first4=Sontosh Kumar|last5=Khusru|first5=Amirul|last6=Rahman|first6=Atiq|last7=Vineis|first7=Paolo|display-authors=3|date=September 2011|title=Drinking Water Salinity and Maternal Health in Coastal Bangladesh: Implications of Climate Change|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1328–1332|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002804|pmc=3230389|pmid=21486720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands. These islands possess limited freshwater supplies, namely ground water lenses and rain fall. When the protective coral reefs surrounding them erodes due to higher temperatures and acidic water chemistry, salt water is able to infiltrate the lens and contaminate the drinking water supply.&lt;ref name="atoll" /&gt; In coastal Bangladesh it has been demonstrated that seasonal hypertension in pregnant women is connected with such phenomenon due to high sodium intake from drinking water.&lt;ref name="child" /&gt; Reef erosion, coupled with sea level rise, tends to flood low-lying areas more frequently during storm surges and weather events. Warming ocean waters generate larger and more devastating weather events that can decimate coastal populations especially without the protection of coral reefs.

===Human health===
The health of our oceans has a direct effect on the health humans. According to Small and Nicholls, they estimated that 1.2 billion people worldwide, lived in the near-coastal region (within 100&amp;nbsp;km and 100m of the shoreline).&lt;ref name=settle&gt;{{cite journal |last=Small |first=Christopher |last2=Nicholls |first2=Robert J. |title=A Global Analysis of Human Settlement in Coastal Zones |journal=Journal of Coastal Research |date=Summer 2003 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=584–599 |jstor=4299200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data was collected in 1990 and therefore is a conservative estimate in modern terms. In the U.S. alone 53% of the population lives within 50 miles of the coastal shoreline.&lt;ref name=grass&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delorenzo |first=Marie E. |last2=Wallace |first2=Sarah C. |last3=Danese |first3=Loren E. |last4=Baird |first4=Thomas D. |title=Temperature and Salinity effects on the toxicity of common pesticides to the grass shrimp, ''Palaemonetes pugio'' |journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health |year=2008 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=455–460 |doi=10.1080/03601230902935121|pmid=20183050 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1234438 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans rely heavily on oceans for food, employment, recreation, weather patterns and transportation.&lt;ref name=guest&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sandifer |first=Paul A. |first2=A.

===Food safety===
Our insatiable appetite for seafood of all types has led to overfishing and has already significantly strained marine food stocks to the point of collapse in many cases. With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans. One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called [[domoic acid]] which is responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]].&lt;ref name=pseudo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tatters |first=Avery O. |first2=Fei-Xue |last2=Fu |first3=David A. |last3=Hutchins |title=High {{CO2}} and Silicate Limitation Synergistically Increase the Toxicity of ''Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta'' |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |date=February 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=1–7 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032116 |pmid=22363805 |pmc=3283721 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...732116T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater {{CO2}} concentrations associated with ocean acidification.&lt;ref name=pseudo/&gt;  Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; [[Ciguatera fish poisoning]], [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], azaspiracid shellfish poisoning, [[diarrhetic shellfish poisoning]], [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]] and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning.&lt;ref name=pseudo/&gt;

==Extreme weather events==
Infectious disease often accompanies [[extreme weather]] events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Niño cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and [[flash flood]]s.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

===Drought===
Arguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant's resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures.
A number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants.
During times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=William J. |last2=Haack |first2=Robert A. |title=Role of Drought in Outbreaks of Plant-Eating Insects |journal=[[BioScience]] |date=February 1987 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110–118 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&amp;context=barkbeetles |doi=10.2307/1310365|jstor=1310365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=Parul |title=Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality: Exploring Nutritional Pathways |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |date=January 2010 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=177S–181S |pmc=2793127 |pmid=19923384 |doi=10.3945/jn.109.111708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===
[[Health]] concerns around the world can be linked to [[floods]]. With the increase in temperatures worldwide due to climate change the increase in flooding is unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vigran |first=Anna |title=With Climate Change Comes Floods |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=14 January 2008 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18022014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Floods]] have short and long term negative implications to peoples' health and well being. Short term implications include [[Death|mortalities]], [[injuries]] and [[diseases]], while long term implications include [[non-communicable diseases]] and [[psychosocial]] health aspects.&lt;ref name=alderman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alderman |first=Katarzyna |first2=Lyle R. |last2=Turner |first3=Shilu |last3=Tong |title=Floods and human health: A systematic review |journal=Environment International |date=June 2012 |volume=47 |pages=37–47 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2012.06.003|pmid=22750033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortalities are not uncommon when it comes to floods. The Countries with lower [[incomes]] are more likely to have more [[Death|fatalities]], because of the lack of [[resources]] they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example, if there is a [[flash flood]] it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by [[drowning]]; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong [[current (fluid)|currents]].&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;  [[Deaths]] do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with [[dehydration]], [[heat stroke]], [[heart attack]] and any other [[illness]] that needs [[medical supplies]] that cannot be delivered.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt; Due to flooding mud, grit or sand particles can be deposited into the lakes and rivers. These particles cause the water to become dirty and this becomes a problem as the dirty water leads to water related diseases. For example, cholera and guinea worm disease are caused by dirty water.&lt;ref&gt;thewaterproject.org brighter futures begins with clean water&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Victims who already have a [[chronic illness]] and then sustain a non-fatal injury are put at a higher risk for that non-fatal injury to become [[Death|fatal]]. Injuries are not isolated to just those who were directly in the flood, [[rescue]] teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur anytime during the flood process; before, during and after.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;  Before the flood people are trying to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] as fast as they can, [[motor vehicle accidents]], in this case, are a primary source of injuries obtained post flood. During floods accidents occur with falling [[debris]] or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are where large numbers injuries can occur.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

[[Communicable diseases]] are increased due to many [[pathogens]] and [[bacteria]] that are being transported by the [[water]]. In floods where there are many fatalities in the water there is a [[hygienic]] problem with the handling of bodies, due to the [[panic]] stricken mode that comes over a town in distress.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;  There are many water [[contaminated]] diseases such as [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[diarrheal diseases]], to mention a few. There are certain diseases that are directly correlated with floods they include any [[dermatitis]] and any [[wound]], [[nose]], [[throat]] or [[ear infection]]. [[Gastrointestinal disease]] and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Most of clean water supplies are contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of [[sanitation]] in the water and in living quarters depending on where the flood is and how prepared the [[community]] is for a flood.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

[[Respiratory diseases]] are a common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of [[water damage]] and [[mold]] that grows after an incident. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]] borne diseases increase as well due to the increase in still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are  [[malaria]], [[dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

Non-communicable diseases are a long-term effect of floods. They are either caused by a flood or they are worsened by a flood; they include [[cancer]], [[lung disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Floods have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial [[integrity]]. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. One of the most treated illness in long-term health problems are [[depression (mood)|depression]] caused by the flood and all the [[tragedy]] that flows with one.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

=== Hurricanes ===
Another result of the warming oceans are stronger [[hurricanes]], which will wreak more havoc on land, and in the oceans,&lt;ref name="Storms and Sickness"&gt;{{cite book|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5|pp=161–178|chapter=Storms and Sickness|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create more opportunities for vectors to breed and infectious diseases to flourish.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sobering Predictions" /&gt; [[Extreme weather]] also means stronger winds. These winds can carry vectors tens of thousands of kilometers, resulting in an introduction of new infectious agents to regions that have never seen them before, making the humans in these regions even more susceptible.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;

===Glacial melting===
A [[glacier]] is a mass of ice that has originated from snow that has been compacted via pressure and have definite lateral limits and movements in definite directions.&lt;ref name="Chinn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chinn|first=T.J.|date=2001|title=Distribution of the glacial water resources of New Zealand|url=http://hydrologynz.co.nz/downloads/20071015-094857-JoHNZ_2001_v40_2_Chinn.pdf|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=139–187}}&lt;!-- removed from ref, these point to a different article: {{|doi=10.1016/0022-1694(79)90093-3 |bibcode=1979JHyd...40..139C}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in areas where the temperatures do not get warm enough to melt annual snow accumulation, thus resulting in many layers of snow piling up over many years, creating the pressure needed to make a glacier.  [[Global climate change]] and fluctuation is causing an increasingly exponential melting of Earth's glaciers.  These melting glaciers have many [[social]] and [[ecological]] consequences that directly or indirectly impact the health and well-being of humans.&lt;ref name=Orlove&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orlove |first=Ben |title=Glacier Retreat: Reviewing the Limits of Human Adaptation to Climate Change |journal=Environment |year=2009 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=22–34 |doi=10.3200/envt.51.3.22-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recession of glaciers change [[sea salt]], [[sediment]], and temperature ratios in the ocean which changes currents, weather patterns, and marine life.&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{cite book |title=Changing Planet, changing health |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles, California |isbn=978-0520269095 |author1=Epstein, P. |author2=Ferber, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The melt also [[ocean levels|increases ocean levels]] and decreases the [[Water resources|availability of water]] for human consumption, agriculture, and hydroelectricity.  This aggravates and increases the likelihood of issues such as sanitation,  [[world hunger]], population shifts, and [[Extreme weather|catastrophic weather]] such as flooding, drought, and worldwide temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

Glacial retreat first gained the attention of alpinists and the tourist industry shortly after 1940 – when the globe warmed ~0.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt; Even with 62 years of awareness, [[climate change]] is just becoming an issue for some parts of society. Over this time period the [[alpine glaciers|cirque and steep alpine glaciers]] were able to [[acclimatize]] to the new temperatures posed by climate change; large [[valley glacier]]s have not yet made this adjustment. This means the large valley glaciers are rapidly retreating, as their mass is attempting to achieve equilibrium with the current climate.  If regional [[snow line]]s stay constant, then the glaciers remain constant.&lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt; Today this is clearly not the case as global warming is causing mountain snow lines to rapidly retreat.  Even the United States’ famous [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] is receding.  More than two-thirds of its glaciers have disappeared and it is expected for them to be nonexistent in the park by the year 2030.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Myrna H.P. |last2=Fagre |first2=Daniel B. |title=Modeled Climate Change in Glacier National Park, 1850-2100 |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=131 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0131:mcigci]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glacial melt will affect [[Coastal wetland|low-lying coastal wetlands]] via [[sea level rise]], change key drivers of [[fresh-water ecosystem]]s, shift the timing of snow packs, and alter the unique character of associated fresh water streams off of snow pack.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K.M. |last1=Jenkins |last2=Kingsford |first2=R.T. |last3=Closs |first3=G.P. |last4=Wolfenden |first4=B.J. |last5=Matthaei |first5=C.D. |last6=Hay |first6=S.E. |display-authors=3 |title=Climate change and freshwater ecosystems in Oceania: an assessment of vulnerability and adaption opportunities |journal=[[Pacific Conservation Biology]] |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=201–219 |doi=10.1071/PC110201 |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&amp;file_id=PC110201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been stated that the sea level will rise 28–43&amp;nbsp;cm by 2100;&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; if all the ice on Earth melts, it is predicted that the ocean level will increase 75 meters, destroying many coastal cities.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;  In addition, the freshwater swaps in northern areas are already affected by the intrusion of salt water. “Sea level rise will cause a change of state from freshwater to marine or [[Estuarine|estuarine ecosystems]], radically altering the composition of [[Biotic community|biotic communities]]".&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;

Not only are glaciers causing a rise in sea level, they are causing an increase in [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ESNO) and global temperature itself.&lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt;  Glacier loss adds to global heat rise through a decrease in what is called [[ice-albedo feedback]].  As more ice melts, there is less [[Solar reflectance|solar reflectivity]] and less heat is reflected away from the Earth, causing more heat to be absorbed, and retained in the atmosphere and soil &lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; In addition to the El Niño events, glacial melt is contributing to the rapid turnover of [[sea surface temperatures]] &lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt; and ocean salt content by diluting the ocean water and slowing the [[Atlantic conveyor belt|Atlantic conveyor belt's]] usually swift dive because of a top layer of buoyant, cold, fresh water that slows the flow of warm water to the north.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

Fifty percent of the world's fresh water consumption is dependent glacial runoff.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;  Earth's glaciers are expected to melt within the next forty years, greatly decreasing fresh water flow in the hotter times of the year, causing everyone to depend on rainwater, resulting in large shortages and fluctuations in fresh water availability which largely effects agriculture, power supply, and human health and well-being.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;  Many power sources and a large portion of agriculture rely on glacial runoff in the late summer.  “In many parts of the world, disappearing [[mountain glacier]]s and droughts will make fresh, clean water for drinking, bathing, and other necessary human (and livestock) uses scarce" and a valuable commodity.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

==Deforestation==
===Effects of deforestation in the African Highlands===
 [[Image:Ethiopian highlands 01 mod.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Ethiopian Highlands]]]]

Environmental changes such as deforestation could increase local temperatures in the highlands thus could enhance the vectorial capacity of the [[anopheles]].&lt;ref name=Afrane&gt;{{cite journal |last=Afrane |first=Y.

Environmental changes, [[climate variability]], and climate change are such factors that could affect biology and ecology of Anophelse [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] and their [[disease transmission]] potential.&lt;ref name=Afrane/&gt; Climate change is expected to lead to latitudinal and altitudinal temperature increases. Global warming projections indicate that the best estimate of surface air warming for a “high scenario” is 4 C, with a likely range of 2.4-6.4 C by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press. |location=Cambridge |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_wg2_report_impacts_adaptation_and_vulnerability.htm |author=IPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temperature increase of this size would alter the biology and the ecology of many mosquito vectors and the dynamics of the diseases they transmit such as malaria. Anopheles mosquitoes in highland areas are to experience a larger shift in their metabolic rate due to the climate change. This climate change is due to the deforestation in the highland areas where these mosquitoes dwell. When temperature rises, the [[larvae]] take a shorter time to mature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Munga, S. |author2=Minakawa, N. |author3=Zhou, G. |author4=Githenko, A.K. |author5=Yan, G. |title=Survivorship of Immature Stages of Anopheles gambiae s.l.

In turn this could potentially lead to an increase in malaria transmission when infected humans are available.[[Image:Forest fruits from Barro Colorado.png|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Biodiversity]]]]

===Biodiversity===
[[Deforestation]] is directly linked with a decrease in plant [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=muhammad&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muhammad |first=Ashraf |author2=Hussain, M. |author3=Ahmad, M.S.A |author4=Al-Quariny, F. |author5=Hameed, M. |title=Strategies for conservation of endangered ecosystems |journal=Pakistan Journal of Botany |date=May 2012 |volume=44 |issue=Special Issue |pages=1–6 |url=http://www.pakbs.org/pjbot/PDFs/44(SI2)/01.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This decrease in biodiversity has several implications for human health.  One such implication is the loss of [[herbalism|medicinal plants]].  The use of plants for medicinal purposes is extensive, with ~70 to 80% of individuals worldwide relying solely on plant-based medicine as their primary source of healthcare.&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Alan |title=Plant Conservation: An Ecosystem Approach |year=2006 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=9781844070831 |pages=37–39 |chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This dependency on plants for medicinal purposes is especially rife in [[developing country|developing countries]] that only consume 15% of manufactured pharmaceutical drugs, many of which are fake.&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; Local knowledge surrounding medicinal plants is useful for screening for new herbal medicines that may be useful for treating disease.&lt;ref name=mirsanjari&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mirsanjari |first=Mir Mehrdad |author2=Mirsanjari, Mitra. |title=The role of biodiversity for sustainable environment |journal=International Journal of Sustainable Development |date=May 2012 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=71–86 |ssrn=2054975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Villages and communities which reside continually in a single geographic area over time, create, transmit and apply widespread information surrounding the medicinal resources in the area.&lt;ref name=mirsanjari/&gt; Formal scientific methods have been useful in identifying the active ingredients used in [[ethnopharmacy]] and applying them to modern medicines.  However, it is important that medicinal resources are managed appropriately as they become globally traded in order to prevent [[endangered species|species endangerment]].&lt;ref name=mirsanjari/&gt;

===Mountain pine beetle, forest ecosystems and forest fires===
[[Image:Dendroctonus ponderosae.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Adult mountain pine beetle]]

Climate change and the associated changing weather patterns occurring worldwide have a direct effect on biology, population ecology, and the population of eruptive insects, such as the [[mountain pine beetle]] (MPB). This is because temperature is a factor which determines insect development and population success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sambaraju |first=Kishan R. |last2=Carroll |first2=Allan L. |last3=Zhu |first3=Jun |last4=Stahl |first4=Kerstin |last5=Moore |first5=R.

It is a simple relationship between a [[host (biology)|host]] (the forest), an [[Biological agent|agent]] (the beetle) and the [[Natural environment|environment]] (the weather &amp; temperature).&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; However, as climate change causes mountain areas to become warmer and drier, pine beetles have more power to infest and destroy the forest ecosystems, such as the whitebark pine forests of the Rockies.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; This is a forest so important to forest ecosystems that it is called the “rooftop of the rockies”. Climate change has led to a threatening pine beetle [[pandemic]], causing them to spread far beyond their native habitat. This leads to [[ecosystem]] changes, [[forest fires]], [[floods]] and hazards to human [[health]].&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;

The whitebark pine ecosystem in these high elevations plays many essential roles, providing support to plant and animal life.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;  They provide food for [[grizzly bears]] and [[squirrels]], as well as shelter and breeding grounds for [[elk]] and [[deer]]; protects [[Drainage divide|watersheds]] by sending water to parched foothills and plains; serves as a reservoir by dispensing supplies of water from melted snowpacks that are trapped beneath the shaded areas; and creates new soil which allows for growth of other trees and plant species.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Without these pines, animals do not have adequate food, water, or shelter, and the reproductive life cycle, as well as quality of life, is affected as a consequence.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Normally, the pine beetle cannot survive in these frigid temperatures and high elevation of the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; However, warmer temperatures means that the pine beetle can now survive and attack these forests, as it no longer is cold enough to freeze and kill the beetle at such elevations.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Increased temperatures also allow the pine beetle to increase their life cycle by 100%: it only takes a single year instead of two for the pine beetle to develop. As the Rockies have not adapted to deal with pine beetle [[infestations]], they lack the defenses to fight the beetles.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Warmer [[weather patterns]], [[drought]], and beetle defense mechanisms together dries out [[sap]] in [[pine trees]], which is the main mechanism of defense that trees have against the beetle, as it drowns the beetles and their eggs.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; This makes it easier for the beetle to infest and release chemicals into the tree, luring other beetles in an attempt to overcome the weakened defense system of the pine tree. As a consequence, the host (forest) becomes more vulnerable to the disease-causing agent (the beetle).&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;

The whitebark forests of the Rockies are not the only forests that have been affected by the mountain pine beetle. Due to temperature changes and wind patterns, the pine beetle has now spread through the [[Continental Divide]] of the Rockies and has invaded the fragile [[boreal forest]]s of [[Alberta]], known as the “lungs of the Earth”.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; These forests are imperative for producing [[oxygen]] through [[photosynthesis]] and removing [[carbon]] in the [[atmosphere]]. But as the forests become infested and die, [[carbon dioxide]] is released into the environment, and contributes even more to a warming climate. Ecosystems and humans rely on the supply of oxygen in the environment, and threats to this boreal forest results in severe consequences to our planet and human health.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; In a forest ravaged by pine beetle, the dead logs and kindle which can easily be ignited by [[lightning]]. [[Forest fires]] present dangers to the environment, human health and the [[economy]].&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;  They are detrimental to [[air quality]] and [[vegetation]], releasing [[toxic]] and [[carcinogenic]] compounds as they burn.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Due to human induced [[deforestation]] and climate change, along with the pine beetle pandemic, the strength of forest ecosystems decrease. The infestations and resulting [[diseases]] can indirectly, but seriously, effect human health. As droughts and temperature increases continue, so does the frequency of devastating forest fires, [[insect]] infestations, forest diebacks, [[acid rain]], habitat loss, animal endangerment and threats to safe drinking water.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;

===Smoke from wildfires===

==Displacement/migration==
{{See also|Environmental migrant}}
Climate change causes displacement of people in several ways, the most obvious—and dramatic—being through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats causing people to seek shelter or livelihoods elsewhere. Slow onset phenomena, including effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihoods and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. This is currently happening in areas of Africa's [[Sahel]], the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts. Deteriorating environments triggered by climate change can also lead to increased conflict over resources which in turn can displace people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888 |title=Environment a Growing Driver in Displacement of People |work=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme environmental events are increasingly recognized as a key driver of migration across the world. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced drought and sea-level rise. Most of those compelled to leave their homes eventually returned when conditions improved, but an undetermined number became migrants, usually within their country, but also across national borders.&lt;ref name=bogumil&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Bogumil |last=Terminski |title=Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges |publisher=Centre d'Etude de l'Ethnicité et des Migrations, Université de Liège |date=2012 |url=http://labos.ulg.ac.be/cedem/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2012/09/Environmentally-Induced-Displacement-Terminski-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia and the Pacific is the global area most prone to natural disasters, both in terms of the absolute number of disasters and of populations affected. It is highly exposed to climate impacts, and is home to highly vulnerable population groups, who are disproportionately poor and marginalized. A recent Asian Development Bank report highlights “environmental hot spots” that are particular risk of flooding, [[cyclones]], [[typhoons]], and water stress.&lt;ref name="beta"&gt;{{cite report|title=Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=Asian Development Bank |date=2012 |url=http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406002645/http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-06 |isbn=978-92-9092-611-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce migration compelled by worsening environmental conditions, and to strengthen resilience of at-risk communities, governments should adopt policies and commit financing to social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure
development, and disaster risk management. Though every effort should be made to ensure that people can stay where they live, it is also important to recognize that migration can also be a way for people to cope with environmental changes. If properly managed, and efforts made to protect the rights of migrants, migration can provide substantial benefits to both origin and destination areas, as well as to the migrants themselves. However, migrants&amp;nbsp;– particularly low-skilled ones&amp;nbsp;– are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.&lt;ref name="beta" /&gt;

The links between the gradual environmental degradation of climate change and displacement are complex: as the decision to migrate is taken at the household level, it is difficult to measure the respective influence of climate change in these decisions with regard to other influencing factors, such as [[poverty]], [[population growth]] or [[employment]] options.&lt;ref name=bogumil/&gt; This situates the debate on [[environmental migrant|environmental migration]] in a highly contested field: the use of the term 'environmental refugee', although commonly used in some contexts, is disrecommended by agencies such as the [[UNHCR]] who argue that the term 'refugee' has a strict legal definition which does not apply to environmental migrants.&lt;ref name="UNHCR on environmental migration terminology"&gt;{{cite report |last=Black |first=Richard |title=Environmental refugees: myth or reality? |series=New Issues in Refugee Research |id=Working Paper No. 34 |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |date=March 2001 |url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0d00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] nor the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international agreement on climate change, includes any provisions concerning specific assistance or protection for those who will be directly affected by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Sense of Climate Change, Natural Disasters, and Displacement: A Work in Progress |first=Elizabeth |last=Ferris |date=14 December 2007 |work=[[The Brookings Institution]] |url=http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606095750/http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential''''' is published by the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA). It is available online since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=1#qt-encyclopedia UIA Online Encyclopedia]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt; and was previously available as a CD-ROM and as a three-volume book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=2#qt-encyclopedia Hardcover edition of the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt; The online Encyclopedia is currently in a redevelopment phase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/projects/encyclopedia UIA Encyclopedia redevelopment]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' was started in 1972 and now comprises more than 100,000 entries and 700,000 links, as well as 500 pages of introductory notes and commentaries. The Encyclopedia collects information on [[problem]]s, [[strategy|strategies]], [[value (ethics)|values]], concepts of [[personal development|human development]], and various intellectual resources.

== Databases, entries, and interlinks ==
The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' is made up from data gathered from many sources.

== Notes and commentaries within the ''Encyclopedia'' projects ==
The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' contains nearly 500 pages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/319419 Expanding Resources on International Organizations], a review by Chadwick F. Alger, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; of introductory notes and commentaries. Some of them just provide readers with usual information about the work content and its organization. Most of them, however, represent extensive reports on the exploratory work done by the editors in eight projects (also called research areas, or sections). Here are those projects, with illustrative examples of key ideas figuring in the notes and commentaries.

=== Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project ===
A first objective of the editors in that project&lt;ref name=encycintro&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164014 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is to collect and present information on the following topics: the problems with which humanity perceives itself to be faced; the organizational, human, and intellectual resources it believes it has at its disposal; the values by which it is believed any change should be guided; the concepts of human development considered to be either the means or the end of any such social transformation. A second objective is to clarify the conceptual challenge of interrelating such plentiful and disparate or even contradictory information. A third objective is to enable alternation between viewpoints from different cultures, ideologies, beliefs and even "facts", as a way for individuals and societies to become empowered with an appropriate response to the problematic conditions of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=5 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: significance]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=4 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: objectives]. Union of International Associations.

Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the disagreement amongst the advocates of different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the ''Encyclopedia'' uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing an increasing number of people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=2 World problems project – Significance: constraints on a problem-focused approach]. Uia.be (21 May 1973). Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=23 World problems project – Comments: general]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' databases are much about how problems, strategies, values, development concepts, and organizations are linked together. As a result, the possibility of focusing on [[feedback|feedback loops]] has proven to be an important feature of the ''Encyclopedia'', and a program has been carried out to identify "''vicious problem loops''". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain.  Here is an example: Man-made disasters, Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, Man-made disasters. Solutions that focus on only one problem in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=19 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: feedback loops and dependent co-arising].

=== World problems and global issues ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/285958 World problems project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; endeavors to present all the phenomena in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute a challenge to creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the [[problem]]s that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort has been made to determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that [[complexity]]. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.&lt;ref name=sections&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=11 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Content: sections and sub-sections].

Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Views concerning problems are extremely varied. Several pages in the notes and commentaries deal with that variety. Problems are agenda items for assemblies or conferences; action targets for organizations; issues for political parties or governments; events or topics for the media; markets for businesses; sins for religions; puzzles for sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=8 World problems project – Criteria: problem disguises and problem evasion]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems can be viewed as synonymous with chaos and disorder, or as elements in an ordered array; as static or dynamic entities; as discrete or continuous phenomena; as objective things or subjective experiences; as directly experienceable phenomena or as indirect implications of seemingly innocent phenomena; as inherently comprehensible or incomprehensible entities; as the results of due processes or as spontaneous phenomena. For many people in the West problems may be considered as artifacts of concerned minds, about which reason, principles, or history are relevant, while in the East to conceive of life as presenting problems to be solved may be seen as a misconception of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=7 World problems project – Criteria: assumptions]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other pages of notes and commentaries deal extensively with the variety of points of view under headings such as ''Approaches to problems'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=24 World problems project – Comments: approaches to problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beyond the problem-lobby mindset'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=25 World problems project – Comments: beyond the problem-lobby mindset].

Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global strategies and solutions ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/190 Global strategies project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; aims at identifying the complete range of [[strategy|strategies]] perceived by constituencies acting at the international level.

The conventional way of addressing any problem situation is to elaborate a strategy, but given the number, variety and interrelationships of the problems, it is uncertain whether any conventional strategy could be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/304593 Global strategies project – Rationale]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, many groups have "answers" to the current crisis. The proponents of each such answer naturally attach special importance to their own as being of crucial relevance at this time, or even as being the only appropriate basis for a viable world society in the future. However, that focus on "answer production", a vital moving force in society, obscures the manner in which such answers, in the absence of integration between them, undermine each other’s significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=1 World problems project – Significance: acknowledgement of the universe of problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to the editors that the elements of the strategic challenge at this time include:
*a vast and changing network of perceived problems, on which no single body has (or possibly could have) adequate control;
*a vast and changing network of conceptual tools and knowledge resources, which is not (and possibly could not be) controlled by any single body;
*a vast and changing [[social network|network]] of agencies, organizations, groups and active individuals spanning every conceivable human interest and extending from the community level to the international level, and on which no single body has (or possibly could or should have) adequate control.
The strategic problem therefore is how to ensure that the appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived in various parts of the social system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=20 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: network strategy]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pages of notes and commentaries describe in details various approaches to global strategies, and their limits. Such are ''Strategic ecosystem: beyond "The Plan"'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=18 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: beyond "The Plan"]. Union of International Associations.

Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A long series of pages explores how to "move beyond the unimodal answer and recognize that because each form of action has both strengths and weaknesses, the key to a more effectively multimodal answer lies in finding how to interrelate the various unimodal answers so that they correct for each others weaknesses and counteract each others excesses.” But, it must also be asked, is integrated action of any type feasible at this time? The exploration begins with ''Strategic appropriateness: questionable answers'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=44 Global strategies project – Strategic appropriateness: questionable answers].

=== Human potential and development ===
The purpose of that project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/167 Human development project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is to provide profiles of [[personal development|human development]] approaches and modes of [[consciousness|awareness]], and their relationships, as perceived by different beliefs systems, disciplines, religions, and cultures. Much of the material in this section is about the limitations of language in expressing levels of significance beyond that which can be effectively captured by words, so that, seemingly, what we need to understand may only be expressible in a "language" that we do not know! That paradox is explored in a page entitled ''Language and the reconstruction of reality''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/155?kap=20 Human potential and development project – Comments: language and the reconstruction of reality]. Union of International Associations.

Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is to review the range of communication possibilities of [[metaphor]], [[pattern]] and [[symbol]]. New conceptual tools are required to configure very large quantities of information into patterns that are both memorable and meaningful, and metaphor is often the only means to deal comprehensibly with complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=6 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: distinguishing uses of the Encyclopedia].

Work on the first edition started with funds from Mankind 2000, matching those of the [[Union of International Associations|UIA]]. The publisher [[K G Saur Verlag|Klaus Saur]], of Munich, provided funds, in conjunction with those from the UIA, for work on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions. Seed funding for the third volume of the 4th edition was also provided on behalf of Mankind 2000.&lt;ref name=backstrat /&gt; In the nineties, seed funding was provided, again on behalf of Mankind 2000, for computer equipment which subsequently allowed the UIA to develop a large website and make progressively available for free the ''Encyclopedia'' databases as from the 1994–1995 edition. In turn, this proven [[knowledge management]] capacity enabled the UIA, on the initiative of Nadia McLaren, a consultant ecologist who has been a primary editor for the ''Encyclopedia'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164090 Nadia McLaren].

The ''Encyclopedia'' was the fruit of a continuing processing of documents gathered from many of the thousands of the [[international organization]]s profiled in the ''[[Yearbook of International Organizations]]''. Many such bodies regularly produce a wide range of material on the areas of their concern, many regularly send documents to the UIA, and many, when requested more specifically, supplied documents for the ''Encyclopedia''. The following organizations provided documents in the greatest quantity: FAO, ILO, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNCTD, WHO, Commonwealth Secretariat, Council of Europe, OECD, World Bank group. Furthermore, the United Nations Library in Geneva facilitated access to other material over two decades.&lt;ref name=back&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=8 Encyclopedia of world problem and human potential project – Overview: background and acknowledgements].

He reports in ''Encyclopedia Illusions''&lt;ref name=illusions /&gt; how the narrow focus of the [[Club of Rome]] on a few socio-economic aspects of futures research prompted the much vaster exploration concerning world problems and human potential.

Anthony Judge was the architect and managing editor of the ''Encyclopedia''. He was also the main author of the notes and commentaries. The principal editors over the years have been, for different editions, Jon Jenkins and Maureen Jenkins (who had also worked at the Institute of Cultural Affairs), Owen Victor, Jacqueline Nebel, Nadia McLaren, and Tomáš Fülöpp. There were also enthusiastic editorial contributions from volunteers. All people related to the UIA who worked directly on one or more of the five ''Encyclopedia'' editions figure on a list that can be found online under the heading ''Associates of the Union of Intelligible Associations''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-intelligible.org/associates/ Associates of the Union of Intelligible Associations].

[[Richard Slaughter]] emphasized that the significance of the work is not its size or the scope of its references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted. The accompanying notes and commentaries, he said, are good enough to be published separately because they contain highly cogent observations on the "global problematique", commentaries on the work of numerous great thinkers from a wide variety of fields, and an impressive array of insights about the epistemology, symbolism, metaphysics, metaphors and linguistic representations of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.org/reviews/slaught.php A meta-linguistic resource] Richard A.

{{distinguish|End of the world (disambiguation)}}
The '''end of history''' is a political and philosophical concept that supposes that a particular political, economic, or social system may develop that would constitute the end-point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government. A variety of authors have argued that a particular system is the "end of history" including [[Thomas More]] in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=J. J.|title="The End of History": A Reappraisal of Marx's Views on Alienation and Human Emancipation|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique|date=1971|volume=4|issue=3|pages=367–380|jstor=3231359}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Alexandre Kojève]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/kojeve-s.htm|title = History and Desire in Kojève|last = Boucher|first = Geoff|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Francis Fukuyama]] in the 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="SpiegelFukuyamaInterview"&gt;Fukuyama himself began to revise his ideas and abandon some of the neoconservative components of his thesis since the [[Iraq War]]. [http://www.spiegel.de/international/interview-with-ex-neocon-francis-fukuyama-a-model-democracy-is-not-emerging-in-iraq-a-407315.html Interview with Ex-Neocon Francis Fukuyama: "A Model Democracy Is not Emerging in Iraq"] Spiegel Online, March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an end of history differs from ideas of an [[Eschatology|end of the world]] as expressed in various religions, which may forecast a complete destruction of the Earth or of life on Earth, and the end of the human race as we know it. The end of history instead proposes a state in which human life continues indefinitely into the future without any further major changes in society, system of governance, or economics.

==History==
The phrase, 'the end of history' was first used by French philosopher and mathematician [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1861 "to refer to the end of the historical dynamic with the perfection of civil society".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"&gt;[[Mike Featherstone]], "Global and Local Cultures", in John Bird, Barry Curtis, Tim Putnam, ''Mapping the Futures: Local Cultures, Global Change'' (1993), p. 184, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Arnold Gehlen]] adopted it in 1952 and it has been taken up more recently by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Gianni Vattimo|Vattimo]]".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"/&gt;

The formal development of an idea of an "end of history" is most closely associated with Hegel, although Hegel discussed the idea in ambiguous terms, making it unclear whether he thought such a thing was a certainty or a mere possibility.&lt;ref&gt;William Desmond, "Hegel, Art, and History", in Robert L. Perkins, ed., ''History and System: Hegel's Philosophy of History'' (1984), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Postmodernism==
A postmodern understanding of the term differs in that "The idea of an 'end of history' does not imply that nothing more will ever happen. Rather, what the [[postmodern]] sense of an end of history tends to signify is, in the words of contemporary historian [[Keith Jenkins]], the idea that 'the peculiar ways in which the past was historicized (was conceptualized in modernist, linear and essentially metanarrative forms) has now come to an end of its productive life; the all-encompassing "experiment of modernity" ... is passing away into our postmodern condition'."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'' (2004), p. 89, quoting Keith Jenkins (2001), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental globalization'''  refers to the internationally coordinated practices and regulations (often in the form of [[international treaties]]) regarding [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt; An example of environmental globalization would be the series of International Tropical Timber Agreement treaties ([[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006|2006]]), establishing [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] and promoting [[sustainable management]] of [[tropical forests]]. Environmental globalization is usually supported by [[non-governmental organization]]s and governments of [[developed countries]], but opposed by governments of [[developing countries]] which see pro-environmental initiatives as hindering their economic development.

Environmental globalization is related to [[economic globalization]], as economic development on a global scale has environmental impacts on such scale, which is of concern to numerous organizations and individuals.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BenyonDunkerley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Benyon|author2=David Dunkerley|title=Globalization: The Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doB9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78240-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; While economic globalization has environmental impacts, those impacts should not be confused with the concept of environmental globalization.&lt;ref name=Grainger&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/abstract|title=Environmental Globalization|last=Grainger|first=Alan|date=1 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470670590|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regards, environmental globalization is in direct opposition to economic globalization, particularly when the latter is described as encouraging trade, and the former, as promoting pro-environment initiatives that are an impediment to trade.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-240"/&gt; For that reason, an environmental activist might be opposed to economic globalization, but advocate environmental globalization.&lt;ref name="DobratzWaldner2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Betty Dobratz|author2=Lisa K Waldner|author3=Timothy Buzzell|title=Power, Politics, and Society: An Introduction to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoK9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA346|date=14 October 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34529-9|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grainger has discussed that environmental globalization in the context of international agreements on pro-environmental initiatives. According to him, precursors to modern environmental globalization can be found in the [[colonial era]] [[forestry|scientific forestry]] (research into how to create and restore forests).&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

==Supporters and opponents==
According to Grainger, environmental globalization (in the form of pro-environmental international initiatives) is usually supported by various [[non-governmental organization]]s&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

[[World Trade Organization]] has also been criticized as focused on economic globalization (liberalizing trade) over concerns of environmental protection, which are seen as impeding the trade.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-247"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA247|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-248"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA248|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Yearley states that WTO should not be described as "anti-environmental", but its decisions have major impact on environment worldwide, and they are based primarily on economic concerns, with environmental concerns being given secondary weight.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-250"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA250|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIBA Women's World Ranking''' is the [[FIBA]]'s rankings of national women's [[basketball]] teams. FIBA ranks women's national teams in both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all competitions involving both sexes.

==Calculation==
FIBA still uses the competition-based system to determine its women's rankings. As noted above, this system was also used to determine men's rankings prior to 2017. FIBA has announced that it will introduce a game-based ranking procedure similar to that currently used for men's rankings in the indeterminate future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/faq |title=FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |publisher=FIBA |accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events' weights===
FIBA uses a [[weighted arithmetic mean]] to determine the statistical weight of each of the tournaments. Each event is assigned point weight that is based partly on how competitive the tournament is and partly on which national teams are participating:&lt;ref name="how"&gt;[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/even/rank/p/openNodeIDs/998/selNodeID/998/howItWork.html FIBA.com: How it works]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition ranking points===
[[File:FIFA World Rankings for Women.png|thumb|300px|Map of FIBA World Ranking for women]]
As opposed to [[Association football|football]] tournaments, teams still have to go through a series of consolation and classification rounds even if they've been eliminated from title contention, so that a complete ranking of the teams will be possible.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

The calculations are done after the tournaments stated above in a group of two Olympic cycles (8 years). The oldest tournament outside the 8-year period is discarded and replaced with the newest competition.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

This means that in every computation, there are:
* Four continental championships
* Two [[FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup]]s
* Two [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball tournaments]]

The {{wnbt|United States}}' 1000.0 points were calculated by this method:

The channel is targeted towards overseas [[Filipinos]] and their families in the Philippines. The network airs shows produced by [[GMA Network]]. Drawing on programming from its [[DZBB-TV|flagship station]] in the Philippines, the network's programs can be seen worldwide.

==Programming==
{{main|List of programs broadcast by GMA Pinoy TV}}

The programming of GMA Pinoy TV consists mostly of &lt;ref name="GMA TV Shows"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filipinotvshows.com/gma-shows-replay/|title=GMA TV Shows|work=GMA TV Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Philippines from [[GMA Network]] as well as previously aired shows, documentaries, films, and sports events from the Philippines. The delay of GMA Pinoy TV's dramas all air on one-episode delay basis. Most weekend shows are up to date, with the exception of some shows that air on a one-episode delay basis.

==History==

===2005–2014===
GMA Pinoy TV was first launched in Japan on March 2005. It was later launched in several parts of the United States in the same year, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and the states of the East Coast. The official GMA Pinoy TV launch in America happened in San Francisco on 23 July 2005 and was aired on ''[[SOP (Philippine TV series)|SOP]]'' the following Sunday, 31 July 2005.

In 2006, the so-called Filipino colors—red, blue and yellow—were used for the graphics and since December 2006, the on-screen graphics of GMA Pinoy TV is being changed every Christmas season.

In 2011, the delays of the shows on GMA Pinoy TV receded from months of delay to two days delay for primetime shows and three days delay for afternoon dramas. On the first quarter of 2011, GMA Pinoy TV and its home network in the Philippines revealed a new logo with minor changes. The "GMA" letters part is seen to be more embossed and the logo has a "glow" effect. On 28 February 2011 for the first time in GMA International's history, two programs that started airing on GMA Pinoy TV that were still running with new episodes were switched over to [[GMA Life TV]], where it will then air its new episodes to occupy free time slots. This then led to replays of other Kapuso shows. The shows included ''Pinoy MD'' and ''[[Love ni Mister, Love ni Misis]]''. All this will be straightened out once [[GMA News TV]] starts its [[GMA News TV International|international operations]] sometime 2nd to 3rd quarter of 2011.

On 5 April 2011, though already launched in the Philippines on 27 March 2011, GMA Pinoy TV officially launched the 2011 summer slogan of GMA "Halo-Halo Ang Summer Saya". This took some time to launch on GMA Pinoy TV because significant edits were made in which some of the programs on the original version were not slated to air on GMA Pinoy TV like ''Man vs. Beast'' but beside that, the international version of the station ID still included planned shows of Summer 2011. Also in April 2011, GMA Pinoy TV is now being broadcast by COX Communications in Arizona, areas like Tucson and Arizona, on Channel 482.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pinoytvshows.mobi/category/abs-cbn-tv-shows/|title=ABS GMA Shows|work=GMA ABS TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report dated 16 May 2011 regarding the consolidated gross revenues of GMA Network, Inc. in the 1st quarter of 2011, it is noted that GMA Pinoy TV's subscriptions grew by 10 percent (approximately 300,000 subscribers) and GMA Life TV's subscriptions grew by 2 percent (approximately 128,000).

On 24 November 2011, Thanksgiving Day in the US, GMA Pinoy TV launched the Christmas-themed graphics for 2011, which also included the upper-right logo being converted to a Christmas-themed one. This was also the same date that GMA Network revamped its websites, with new features and a new look.
On December 2011, GMA Pinoy TV’s subscriber count closed at 291,309, a 7% increase over the 2010 closing subscriber number of 273,317. Because of this, revenues grew by 8% year-on-year and are expected to grow at that rate 2012 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=53472|title=BusinessWorld - Pinoy TV goes international|work=bworldonline.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221533/http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=53472|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2012, ''[[My Beloved (TV series)|My Beloved]]'' became is the first primetime TV Drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV. On 15 March 2012, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-screen graphics, replacing the 2010 version of approximately 30 seconds to one that is approximately 15 seconds.

On 18 May 2012, GMA Pinoy TV released on-air alternate versions of its "Up Next" and "You're Watching" bumpers; they were much shorter and instead of clips of the shows, they featured the stars of the respective shows. On 5 June 2012, GMA Pinoy TV began experiencing audio issues with its broadcast, audio that is not so typical of High-Definition, High-Resolution cameras tha GMA uses. On 21 June 2012, the issue was resolved and the original audio type was restored. For the first time in GMA history, ''Idol sa Kusina'', a program originally aired on QTV then [[GMA News TV]] and [[simulcast]] on GMA Life TV moved to GMA Pinoy TV on 14 July 2012. In September 2012, for the first time in GMA Pinoy TV's history, ''[[24 Oras]]'', the network's flagship newscast program will had a four-hour-delayed telecast, meaning in the US, the show aired 7:30am (US-PST), 10:30am (US-EST), and 4:30am (Hawaii). This is the first time the network has placed ''24 Oras'' right after ''Unang Hirit'', which also changed timeslots to give way for 24 Oras.

As of 30 October 2012, four drama series were premiered that were one-day delayed: ''[[My Beloved (TV series)|My Beloved]]'', ''[[One True Love (TV series)|One True Love]]'', ''[[Coffee Prince (2012 TV series)|Coffee Prince]]'', and ''[[Temptation of Wife (2012 TV series)|Temptation of Wife]]''. This is part of GMA Pinoy TV's promise to its viewers to lessen airing delays and more original programming being shown. On 30 November 2012, GMA Pinoy TV updated its upper-right corner logo once more to a Christmas-themed one and one that celebrates GMA Pinoy TV's 7th anniversary and the version of the letters "GMA" are the more current one used by GMA. The on-air Christmas graphics which has been annually seen on GMA Pinoy TV was subsequently launched on 1 December 2012 and will last until the first week of January 2013. On 31 December 2012, GMA Pinoy TV aired ''Win na Win sa 2013: The GMA New Year Countdown'' live, making it the third time that GMA aired its New Year countdown live worldwide (previously in 2008 and 2011).

On 2013, ''[[Indio (TV series)|Indio]]'' and ''[[Mundo Mo'y Akin]]'' became the fifth and sixth TV Drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV. This makes all the current and future primetime dramas of GMA to air on a one-day episode delay basis, compared to previously where it started first as long as three-weeks delay to as short as two-days delay. For the first time on GMA Pinoy TV, copyrighted material created and produced by another company, [[National Geographic Channel]], was aired on GMA Pinoy TV on 7 April 2013. The copyrighted material aired under license is the National Geographic Channel Documentary entitled ''Inside Malacanang Palace'', which aired on March 2012, is a special documentary that takes the audience to an exclusive guided tour of the Malacanang Palace of the Philippines.

On the first quarter of 2013, GMA Pinoy TV had a total of 333,000 subscribers while its sister channel, GMA Life TV had 125,000 subscribers. This is based on a report that the Corporate Communications Department of GMA Network has posted. Overall, in 2012 and Q1 of 2013, subscription to GMA International channels increased by 7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/11900/gma-network-reports-p603-million-net-income-in-q1-2013|title=GMA Network reports P603 million net income in Q1 2013 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=15 May 2013|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2013, SingTel relaunched this channel together with [[GMA Life TV]] and in the new Fiesta Pack as well after 2 months of hiatus of this channel.

''[[Anna Karenina (2013 TV series)|Anna Karenina]]'' and ''[[My Husband's Lover]]'' became the seventh and eighth primetime TV drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere. On 27 August 2013, ''[[Pyra: Ang Babaeng Apoy]]'' started airing and was the first GMA Afternoon Prime drama series to be on only a one-episode delay basis, as for previous years, GMA Afternoon Prime dramas have been noted to be two to even four episodes delayed. On 10 September 2013, ''[[Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas]]'' became the ninth primetime TV drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV.

On 17 September 2013, GMA Pinoy TV had experienced technical problems and thus a three-hour delay was caused in its programming schedule, which received negative feedback from the viewers as they were not warned beforehand. The management had appealed to the viewers by saying that such was not intentional and was accidental because of technical/conversion issues. The following day, 18 September 2013, the programming staff of GMA Pinoy TV was prompted to change the programming schedule, effectively removing the airings of [[Eat Bulaga!]] and [[24 Oras]] just a few hours after its original broadcast. Viewers are still hoping for the programming of GMA Pinoy TV to revert to its original state, which most viewers preferred.

On 29 September 2013, a fire hit the basement of GMA Network's Building. The fire was put out in less than 50 minutes as the fire correspondents responded immediately. The fire affected the power supply of GMA Network and thus further affected the normal operations of GMA Network, including the operations of GMA Pinoy TV as well as GMA Life TV and GMA News TV International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/328695/news/metromanila/fire-hits-basement-of-gma-building|title=Fire hits basement of GMA building|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/497645/fire-hits-basement-of-gma-network-center|title=Fire hits basement of GMA Network Center|work=inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fire, temporary programming was aired consisting of replays of shows from the weekend. The fire had caused disappointment and inconvenience on the part of the viewers/subscribers. However, the management of GMA International assured its subscribers that indeed the appropriate measures are being taken and that normal operations are hoped to be restored at the soonest possible time. On 1 October 2013, programming had slowly been restored. Subscribers reported ''[[Unang Hirit]]'', ''[[24 Oras]]'', ''[[The Ryzza Mae Show]]'' and ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' among others to be updated and though slightly off their appropriate timeslot, still was managed to be aired over on GMA Pinoy TV. Also, ''[[My Husband's Lover]]'' aired back-to-back episodes and thus only on 1 October did it become the first TV series of GMA Drama to air the same episode that aired in the Philippines on the same day that it aired on GMA Pinoy TV. ''[[Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas]]'' and ''[[Kahit Nasaan Ka Man]]'' followed and also had back-to-back episodes aired; these "back-to-back" episode appeared to the viewers as hints that the primetime dramas will begin to air on same-day episode basis. However, this idea was dismissed on 2 October 2013 when these shows had re-aired the "catch up" episodes and thus, the primetime dramas were confirmed to be on a one-episode delay basis again. The network's afternoon dramas, ''[[Prinsesa ng Buhay Ko]]'', ''[[Magkano Ba ang Pag-ibig?]]'' and ''[[Pyra: Ang Babaeng Apoy]]'', are still airing on a one-episode delay basis and were not affected by the "catching up" that happened on 1 October. The only afternoon drama left airing on a two-episode delay basis is ''[[Mga Basang Sisiw]]''.

On 5 October 2013, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-air title screen, in celebration of its "8 Years of Bringing Global Pinoys Closer to Home." On 30 November 2013, GMA Pinoy TV updated its upper-right logo to a Christmas-themed one, alongside GMA's Christmas Theme for 2013, "Sundan Natin ang Bituin Pabalik sa Kanyang Piling". The following day, 1 December 2013, the on-air title screen and graphics were updated.

On 17 December 2013, ''[[The Ryzza Mae Show]]'' and ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' were restored to their late night timeslots in the North American feed. It was noted that subscribers continually pleaded GMA Pinoy TV to restore these shows to their late night timeslots as this is convenient for many working subscribers who are only able to watch at that time. After three months and a day of requests, the management finally granted such and the shows were restored to their respective and consecutive late night timeslots. In addition to their restored timeslots, the two shows air as well right after their restored timeslots and so, overall, ''The Ryzza Mae Show'' and ''Eat Bulaga'' air four times on GMA Pinoy TV daily. The New Year Countdown aired on a three-hour delay basis on GMA Pinoy TV on 31 December 2013. From 31 December 2013 to 13 January 2014, GMA Pinoy TV had a special airing of ''[[Titser (TV series)|Titser]]''. This was in the timeslot previously occupied by ''Genesis'' and ''Akin Pa Rin Ang Bukas'', as in the Philippines the timeslots of the two shows were replaced by Hollywood blockbusters.

The GMA Pinoy TV on-screen graphics and logo returned to its regular version on 5 January 2014, marking the end of the Christmas season. GMA Pinoy TV began inserting English subtitles in certain shows like ''[[Wish Ko Lang]]'', ''[[Pepito Manaloto|Pepito Manaloto: Ang Tunay na Kuwento]]'' and ''[[Magpakailanman]]'' on Saturday, 11 January 2014. This is part of GMA Pinoy TV's efforts to expand its audience reach so that not only those who can speak and understand Tagalog can watch GMA Pinoy TV but also those who cannot.

On 22 April 2014, GMA Pinoy TV began to air ''[[Full House (2004 TV series)|Full House]]'', the first Tagalog-dubbed Koreanovela aired on this channel. The shows with English subtitles are noted in the next section "currently broadcast". ''[[Basta Every Day, Happy!]]'' was supposed to premiere on 12 May 2014 (in some territories like the US on the evening of 11 May 2014) and air throughout its entire duration on GMA Pinoy TV but the programming department of GMA International, GMA's international subsidiary, decided to move the show over to [[GMA Life TV]] as it adheres more to GMA Life TV's overall theme as a lifestyle channel as well as the show is a replacement for ''[[Chef Boy Logro: Kusina Master|Kusina Master]]'', so the programming department had seen that the move was done rightfully so.

On 26 May 2014, GMA Pinoy TV began to air ''[[Niño (TV series)|Niño]]'' with no episode delay whatsoever, thus premiering on the same day. This is a historical event for GMA Pinoy TV, as GMA drama series have never aired without episode delays. The nearest to not having a delay was the one-episode
delay policy that was established on 14 February 2012 with the premiere of ''[[My Beloved (TV series)|My Beloved]]''. What is going to happen is in the North American feed as well as on the Australian feed, the premiere of ''[[Niño (TV series)|Niño]]'' and subsequent new episodes on same-day airing will take place on the evening telecast and replays in the afternoon telecasts while in other feeds, particularly, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia Pacific and European feeds,  the premiere and subsequent new episodes will take place in the afternoon telecasts and replays on evening telecasts, thus because these telecasts will take place in the afternoon, such is still not considered delayed, as a new episode of the show still has not premiered. This similar framework followed with ''[[Ang Dalawang Mrs. Real]]'', which premiered on 2 June airing on same-day basis as well along with ''[[Strawberry Lane]]'' on 15 September and ''[[Hiram na Alaala]]'' on 22 September. ''[[Ilustrado (TV series)|Ilustrado]]'', the first BayaniSerye on Philippine Primetime, had a world premiere on all feeds of GMA Pinoy TV on 20 October 2014; this was simultaneous with the premiere in the Philippines and this is the first time such has happened in GMA Pinoy TV history.

On December 2014, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-air title screen and graphics and upper-right logo to a Christmas-themed one, alongside GMA's Christmas theme for 2014, "Share the Love". On December 31, 2014, ''Countdown to 2015: The GMA New Year Countdown Special'' aired live on GMA Pinoy TV.

===2015–present===
The GMA Pinoy TV on-screen graphics and logo returned to its regular version on 4 January 2015, marking the end of the Christmas season. In the 1st quarter of 2015, in response to viewers' requests and to remain competitive in the international market, GMA Pinoy TV began to increase the number of shows with English subtitles, now including daily dramas like ''[[Let the Love Begin (TV series)|Let the Love Begin]]'' and ''[[The Rich Man's Daughter]]''.

On May 10, 2015, Willie Revillame's ''[[Wowowin]]'' premiered on [[GMA Network]] and on GMA Pinoy TV, serving as his return to the Kapuso Network. It is noted that Revillame's popular ''[[Wowowee]]'' aired for five years on GMA and GMA Pinoy TV's rival stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/455861/showbiz/willie-revillame-to-host-game-show-wowowin-in-return-to-gma-network/|title=Willie Revillame to host game show ‘WowoWin’ in return to GMA Network|author=|date=|website=GMA News Online|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2015, the sixth and final State of the Nation Address of President Benigno S.

In mid-2015 GMA's programming changed from news to other programs to four-five hours programming of Pinoy Telenovela block starting with its AfternoonPrime to GMA telebabad Programming with some programs one day delayed however, has caught up throughout with its future schedules. Eat Bulaga airs its initial programming, and Wowowin, Daily news as well and other programming.

On 16 September 2012, in celebration of GMA Pinoy TV's 7th anniversary, ''[[Manny Many Prizes]]' held a special event at Universal Studios Hollywood. The live show featured the show's cast plus Dingdong Dantes, Solenn Heussaff, Julie Anne San Jose, Elmo Magalona and Rochelle Pangilinan.

To celebrate GMA Pinoy TV's 10th anniversary, GMA Pinoy TV rolled out a series of concerts, entitled "Kapusong Pinoy" followed by the name of the place as well as appearances at Filipino cultural events throughout the world, mainly in June and July to celebrate the Philippines' 117th Independence Day. GMA Pinoy TV used the hashtag #Sampuso to celebrate and highlight its 10th year of bringing Filipinos closer to home. The first two concerts were originally supposed to include GMA's Primetime Queen Marian Rivera-Dantes but because of her pregnancy, she chose to withdraw from the concerts for her and her child's safety and AiAi delas Alas served as her replacement in the first two concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/482134/showbiz/gma-pinoy-tv-kicks-off-10th-anniversary-celebration-with-ai-ai-delas-alas-in-kapusong-pinoy-vancouver-and-anaheim/|title=GMA Pinoy TV kicks off 10th anniversary celebration with Ai-Ai delas Alas in Kapusong Pinoy Vancouver and Anaheim|author=|date=|website=GMA News Online|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Sampuso concert was on May 29, 2015 (originally slated for April 24, 2015), at the Orpheum Theater in Vancouver, Canada, featuring AiAi delas Alas, Christian Bautista, Jonalyn Viray, Alden Richards, and Betong Sumaya as Antonietta of [[Bubble Gang]].

GMA announced a third concert in celebration of GMA Pinoy TV's 10th anniversary. The concert took place in New York at the Town Hall on September 5, 2015, featuring Primetime King Dingdong Dantes, AiAi delas Alas, Julie Anne San Jose, Christian Bautista, and Betong Sumaya as Antonietta of [[Bubble Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thetownhall.org/event/676-kapusong-pinoy-sa |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822230805/http://thetownhall.org/event/676-kapusong-pinoy-sa |archivedate=22 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/kapusong-pinoy-sa-new-york-/E0-001-085319354-1|title=Kapusong Pinoy Sa New York|author=|date=|website=Eventful|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more concerts in celebration of GMA Pinoy TV's 10th Anniversary slated.

'''Glenn Hauser''' (born April 12, 1945 in [[Berkeley, California]]) is an internationally known American [[DXing|DX]]er&lt;ref name="Berg2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Jerome S.|title=Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjP978PYo0MC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=October 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3996-6|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BennettHardy1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Hank|last2=Hardy|first2=David T.|last3=Yoder|first3=Andrew R.|title=The complete shortwave listener's handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_tmz9JIRHsC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=September 1993|publisher=TAB Books|isbn=978-0-8306-4347-9|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[radio]] host from [[Enid, Oklahoma]]. He produces and presents a weekly 30-minute program, ''World Of Radio'',&lt;ref name="League1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Radio Relay League|title=ARRL Operating Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICivfre46-QC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=August 1997|publisher=American Radio Relay League|isbn=978-0-87259-614-6|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; heard on a number of [[Public broadcasting|non-commercial]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations throughout the [[United States|U.S.]] and worldwide on [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]].

Hauser began his broadcasting career on [[Radio Canada International]] during the late 1970s, providing DX tips on Sunday nights, and his tips also appeared on [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Nederland's]] ''DX Juke Box'' program. He wrote for ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Modern Electronics]]'', and published ''Review of International Broadcasting''.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, Sheldon, "[http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php Glenn Hauser interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172348/http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php |date=2011-07-06 }}", ''CIDX Special Feature #5'', Summer 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==''World of Radio''==
''World Of Radio'' debuted in 1980 on [[WUOT]]-FM in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], moving to shortwave two years later. The half-hour program consists of Hauser reading news about radio around the world in a characteristic monotone. Although ''World of Radio'' focuses on shortwave news, it covers all aspects of broadcasting. Most items are contributed by listeners to the program or DX publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofradio.com/dxlatest.txt|title=DX Listening Digest|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mundo Radial''===
Hauser also produced ''Mundo Radial'', a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] edition of ''World of Radio'', from January 2002 to November 2007.&lt;ref name=Mundo&gt;[http://www.worldofradio.com/espanol.html Mundo Radial]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Review of International Broadcasting''==
Hauser introduced ''Review of International Broadcasting'' in February 1977.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; The magazine published 154 issues, with columns such as "Listener Insights on Programming," "Radio Equipment Forum," "DX Listening Digest," "The Media Mind" and "Satellite Watch."&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; Contributors included David Newkirk, Loren Cox and Juan Carlos Codina,&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;Berg, Jerome S., "Review of International Broadcasting (1977–1997)", 'Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today'', pg 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; and ''RIB'' also featured columns from the BBC, John Norfolk and Alan Roe.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; It was published monthly during the 1970s and 1980s, later decreasing to quarterly and semiannually before ceasing publication in October 1997.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; ''RIB''{{'}}s successor, ''DX Listening Digest'', went online in 1999.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt;

=={{anchor|Religious views}}Political and religious views==
Hauser is a political [[Liberalism|liberal]] and an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],&lt;!-- Think he identifies as atheist. --&gt; which occasionally puts him at odds with the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist-dominated]] [[Shortwave broadcasting in the United States|American shortwave scene]] which carries ''World of Radio''.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The '''Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth (GAPPS)''' was founded in 2007 as an initiative of [[Seattle Children’s]]. GAPPS’ mission is to lead a collaborative, global effort to increase awareness and accelerate innovative research and interventions that will improve [[maternal health|maternal]], newborn and child health outcomes around the world, with a focus on [[preterm birth]] and [[stillbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/10/S1/S7 |title=Global report on preterm birth and stillbirth  |first= |last= |work=BMC Pregnancy &amp; Childbirth|date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gapps.org/index.php/about/mission_vision/ |title=Mission and Vision |work=GAPPS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GAPPS Repository==
The GAPPS Repository is a [[biobank]] of [[pregnancy]] specimens matched with data from patient questionnaires. It supports research on normal and abnormal pregnancies, including how pregnancy affects maternal and child health after [[childbirth|delivery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2012/03/14/seattle-childrens-sets-up-rare-biobank-of-pregnancy-specimens/ |title=Seattle Children's Sets Up Rare Biobank to Study Premature Birth |work=Xconomy|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/20120410_gapps_biorepository/en/index.html |title=New biorepository to help uncover mysteries of pregnancy and childbirth |work=World Health Organization |date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Repository is also available to researchers to study the [[fetal]] origins of persistent health problems like [[diabetes]], [[obesity]], and [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680302/a-library-of-samples-from-pregnant-women-to-help-disease-research |title=A Library of Samples From Pregnant Women To Help Disease Research |work=Fast Company |date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventing Preterm Birth initiative==
In November 2011 the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] provided $20 million to GAPPS for the Preventing Preterm Birth initiative, part of the foundation's [[Grand Challenges in Global Health]]. The Preventing Preterm Birth initiative focuses on finding new interventions to prevent premature birth and stillbirth by limiting infection and improving nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2011/11/gates-foundation-awards-20m-for.html |title=Gates Foundation awards $20M for premature birth research |work=Puget Sound Business Journal |date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42102">The '''Global Burden of Disease Study''' ('''GBD''') is a comprehensive regional and global research program of [[disease burden]] that assesses [[death|mortality]] and [[disability]] from major diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s. GBD is a collaboration of over 1,800 researchers from 127 countries. Under principal investigator [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], GBD is based out of the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME) at the [[University of Washington]] and funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does a $100 million public health data revolution look like?|url=http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=17751|website=TEDMED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global Burden of Disease Study began in 1990 as a single [[World Bank]]-commissioned&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/announcement/institute-health-metrics-and-evaluation-and-world-health-organization-sign-new |title=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and World Health Organization sign new agreement |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; study, now called GBD 1990.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt; The original project quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY) as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s,&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; to aid comparisons. GBD 1990 was "institutionalized" at the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the research was "conducted mainly by researchers at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and WHO".&lt;ref name="sign" /&gt;

In 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated by WHO to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

The WHO estimates were again updated for 2004 in ''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' (published in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf |title=''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Global health risks'' (published in 2009).&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_Front.pdf |title=''Global health risks: mortality and burden of disease attributable to selected major risks'' |year=2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) was published in 2014.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; The first installment, "Smoking Prevalence and Cigarette Consumption in 187 Countries, 1980–2012", was published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in January, and further installments were published throughout the year.&lt;ref name="ihme_history" /&gt; IHME continued to act as the coordinating center for the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about/history |title=GBD History |publisher= Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation |accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) was published.&lt;ref name="ihme_history" /&gt; The work was still coordinated at IHME.

==Aims==

The GBD has three specific aims:

#To systematically incorporate information on non-fatal outcomes into the assessment of the health status (using a time-based measure of healthy years of life lost due either to premature mortality or to years lived with a disability, weighted by the severity of that disability)
#To ensure that all estimates and projections were derived on the basis of objective epidemiological and demographic methods, which were not influenced by advocates.
#To measure the burden of disease using a metric that could also be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions. The metric chosen was the DALY.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The burden of disease can be viewed as the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in which everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. Causes of the gap are premature mortality, disability and exposure to certain risk factors that contribute to illness.

==Results==

The 2013 report showed that global [[life expectancy]] for both sexes increased from 65.3 years in 1990, to 71.5 years in 2013,&lt;ref name="Lancet2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators| date=2014|title=Global, regional, and national age–sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=The Lancet|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–171|issn=0140-6736|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmid=25530442|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the number of deaths increased from 47.5 million to 54.9 million over the same interval.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; Progress varied widely across [[demographic]] and national groups. Reductions in age-standardised death rates for [[cardiovascular diseases]] and [[cancers]] in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from [[diarrhoea]], [[lower respiratory infections]] and neonatal causes in low-income regions drove the changes. [[HIV/AIDS]] reduced life expectancy in southern [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell, while for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.

Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; For some causes of more than 100,000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, [[pancreatic cancer]], [[atrial fibrillation]] and flutter, drug use disorders, [[diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anaemias]]. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes and malaria remain in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important [[pathogens]] are [[rotavirus]] for diarrhoea and [[pneumococcus]] for lower respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt;

GBD 2015 found that for the first time, annual deaths from [[measles]] had fallen below 100,000 in 2013 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/11/16/vaccinations-vaccine-science-and-a-new-us-president/ |title=Vaccinations, Vaccine Science, and a New US President {{!}} Speaking of Medicine |publisher=[[PLOS]] |date=November 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 31, 2017 |author=Peter Hotez |quote=Those results include new findings just released by the Gates Foundation-supported Global Burden of Disease 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators that found a 75 percent reduction in global measles mortality over the last decade such that (for the first time ever) fewer than 100,000 children died from measles in 2013 and 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl3&amp;pii=S0140673614616822 |title=Table 3: Selected causes of global child deaths in 1990 and 2013 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl5&amp;pii=S0140673616310121 |title=Table 5: Global deaths in 2005 and 2015 for all ages and both sexes combined and age-standardised death rates, with percentage change between 2005 and 2015 for 249 causes |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the global annual rate of new HIV infections has largely stayed the same during the past 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/global-rate-of-new-hiv-infections-hasn-t-fallen-in-a-decade-1.20305 |publisher=Nature News &amp; Comment |title=Global rate of new HIV infections hasn't fallen in a decade |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |author=Nisha Gaind |date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GBD 2015 also introduced the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) as a measure of a location's socio-demographic development that takes into account average income per person, educational attainment, and [[total fertility rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/global-burden-disease-study-2015-gbd-2015-socio-demographic-index-sdi-1980%E2%80%932015 |title=Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) 1980–2015 |website=GHDx |accessdate=February 7, 2017 |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/there-s-a-new-ranking-of-the-healthiest-countries-how-is-yours-doing/ |title=There's a new ranking of the healthiest countries.

'''Global Handwashing Day''' ('''GHD''') is a campaign to motivate and mobilize people around the [[world]] to improve their [[Hand washing|handwashing]] habits.  Washing hands at critical points during the day and washing with [[soap]] are both important. 

Global Handwashing Day occurs on 15 October of each year. The global campaign is dedicated to raising awareness of handwashing with soap as a key factor in [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=20091015004104007&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Lae Marks Global Handwashing Day|last = Rai|first = Frank|date = 12 August 2009|work = Post-Courier (Papua New Guinea)|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Respiratory and intestinal diseases can be reduced by 25-50%.

==Implementation and management==
The Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) (formerly called "[[Public-private partnership|Public Private Partnership]]&amp;nbsp;for Handwashing" (PPPHW)) established Global Handwashing Day in 2008 as a way to promote a global and local vision of handwashing with soap.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=12 October 2012|title=Global Handwashing Day|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=82513752&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=61|issue=40|page=821|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 July 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steering Committee members of the GHP include Colgate-Palmolive; FHI 360; The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Procter &amp; Gamble; UNICEF; Unilever; University at Buffalo; USAID; the Water and Sanitation Programme at the World Bank; and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=The Global Handwashing Partnership|website=globalhandwashing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued research on handwashing habits and practices is commissioned in conjunction with GHD. In 2011, [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget]] (SCA), sponsored a study to assess the handwashing habits of American and Canadian adults, finding that many were not using soap when washing their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=bizwire.c37268574&amp;site=ehost-live|title = New Research Reveals Poor Handwashing Practices|last = |first = |date = 14 October 2011|work = Business Wire|access-date = 10 August 2015|via = Regional Business News – EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aims===
The aims of Global Handwashing Day are to:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Foster and support a general culture of handwashing with soap in all societies
* Shine a spotlight on the state of handwashing in each country
* Raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing with soap.

==Activities==
Each year, over 200 million people celebrate Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208100034/http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day |archivedate=8 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On 15 October 2014, [[Madhya Pradesh]] won the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the most massive handwashing program.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-creates-world-record-for-mass-hand-washing-initiative-guinness-book-acknowledges-feat/article1-1365615.aspx|title = MP Creates World Record for Mass Handwashing Initiative; Guinness Book Acknowledges Feat|last = |first = |date = 3 July 2015|work = Hindustan Times|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 1,276,425 children in 51 different districts participating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Sometimes, groups choose to celebrate GHD on other dates than 15 October. In [[Ethiopia]], 300 people celebrated Global Handwashing Day in [[Addis Ababa]] on 1 November in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://unicefethiopia.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/ethiopia-celebrates-global-handwashing-day/|title = Ethiopia Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last = Bizuwork|first = Demissew|date = 4 November 2013|work = UNICEF Ethiopia|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 15 October 2015, Lupok Central Elementary School, Guiuan Eastern Samar, Philippines celebrated the Global Handwashing Day by doing the proper handwashing before starting classes.

==History==
Global Handwashing Day was initiated by the Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) in August 2008 at the annual [[World Water Week]] in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/our-history/|title = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing – Our History|date = |accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the first Global Handwashing Day took place on 15 October 2008. The date was appointed by the UN General Assembly. The year 2008 was also the [[International Year of Sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/gpsc/events/2008/15_10_08/en/index.html|title = Global Handwashing Day|date = 15 October 2008|accessdate = 24 July 2015|website = World Health Organization|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding bodies in 2008 included: FHI360 (a nonprofit human development organization based in the US),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fhi360.org/about-us|title=fhi360 About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=fhi360|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[UNICEF]], [[Unilever]], [[Water and sanitation program|World Bank Water &amp; Sanitation Program]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]].

===Themes===
*The focus for Global Handwashing Day's inaugural year in 2008 was school children. In that year, the members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than 70 countries. In [[India]] in 2008, [[cricket]] legend [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and his teammates joined an estimated 100 million schoolchildren around the country in lathering up for better health and hygiene as part of the first Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/india_45974.html|title = Star Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar Promotes Handwashing in India|last = Walker|first = Angela|date = 16 October 2008|work = UNICEF|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was initiated to reduce childhood mortality rates and related [[respiratory]] and [[Diarrhea|diarrheal diseases]] by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with [[soap]]. This simple action can reduce the [[mortality rate]] of respiratory disease by 25%. Death from diarrheal diseases can be reduced by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|date=May 2003|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, more than 60 percent of health workers do not adhere to proper hand hygiene. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US health care providers, on average, wash their hands less than half of the time they should. On any given day, one in 25 US hospital patients has at least one health care-associated infection.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings |url=https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of handwashing ===
{{Main article|Handwashing}}
{{tone|section|date=April 2018}}
Handwashing with soap is very effective and the least expensive way to prevent [[diarrhea]] and [[acute respiratory infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=6FI3204107250&amp;site=ehost-live|title=MOH Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last=|first=|date=15 October 2009|work=Arabia 2000|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pneumonia]], a major ARI (acute respiratory infection), is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, killing an estimated 1.8&amp;nbsp;million children per year. [[Diarrhea]] and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5&amp;nbsp;million child deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/The_State_of_the_Worlds_Children_2008.pdf|title=The State of the World’s Children 2008. Child Survival. UNICEF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handwashing with soap is estimated to reduce cases of diarrhea by 30% and respiratory infections by 21% in children under the age of five.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to make handwashing into a [[habit]]. Good handwashing with soap before [[eating]] and after using the toilet into a regular habit can save more lives than any single [[vaccine]] or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute [[respiratory infection]]s by one-quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2013/today-is-global-handwashing-day/|title=Today is Global Handwashing Day|last=Larsen|first=Linda|date=15 October 2013|work=Food Poisoning Bulletin|access-date=24 July 2015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handwashing is usually done together with other [[sanitation]] interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene [[WASH]] programmes.

The Global Handwashing Day helps raise awareness of the importance of washing with soap, but it also makes it fun for children to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=wapo.ea30fbe0-e86a-11e0-8a05-c10ec107dc66&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Getting All Lathered Up|last=Sawyer|first=Kem Knapp|date=10 October 2011|work=The Washington Post|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Regional Business News – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper hygiene requires that individuals know the importance of good hygiene and develop the habits to carry it out.  There are people with plenty of money but nonetheless, they lack the important habits of timely handwashing with soap, and thereby unknowingly endanger themselves and others around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/global-handwashing-day-in_b_5989280.html|title=Global Handwashing Day in the Time of Ebola|author=Jeffrey Sachs|author2=Myriam Sidibe|date=15 October 2014|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peer pressure|Peer influence]] is significant to seeing increased handwashing among students. In a study conducted in [[Kenya]], researchers found that students were much more likely to wash their hands when another student is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Amy J.|last2=Blum|first2=Annalise G.|last3=Breiman|first3=Robert F.|last4=Ram|first4=Pavani K.|last5=Davis|first5=Jennifer|date=27 March 2014|title=Video Surveillance Captures Student Hand Hygiene Behavior, Reactivity to Observation, and Peer Influence in Kenyan Primary Schools|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92571|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|pmc=3968003|pmid=24676389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer influence is only successful, however, when students know that handwashing is a desirable action.

The connections and pathways of the internet could be seen as the pathways of [[neurons]] and [[synapse]]s in a global brain]]

The '''global brain''' is a neuroscience-inspired and futurological vision of the planetary [[information and communications technology]] [[computer network|network]] that interconnects all humans and their technological artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heylighen|first1=F.|title=What is the global brain?|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIFAQ.html|website=Principa Cybernetica Web|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As this network stores ever more [[information]], takes over ever more functions of coordination and communication from traditional organizations, and becomes increasingly [[intelligent]], it increasingly plays the role of a [[brain]] for the planet [[Earth]].

==Basic ideas==
Proponents of the global brain hypothesis claim that the [[Internet]] increasingly ties its users together into a single information processing system that functions as part of the collective [[nervous system]] of the planet. The intelligence of this network is [[collective intelligence|collective]] or [[distributed cognition|distributed]]: it is not centralized or localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. Therefore, no one can command or control it. Rather, it [[self-organization|self-organizes]] or [[emergence|emerges]] from the [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of [[human–computer interaction|interactions]] between its components. This is a property typical of [[complex adaptive systems]].&lt;ref name=CAS-T-17/&gt;

The [[World-wide web]] in particular resembles the organization of a brain with its webpages (playing a role similar to [[neurons]]) connected by [[hyperlinks]] (playing a role similar to [[synapses]]), together forming an [[Association (psychology)|associative]] network along which information propagates.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"&gt;{{cite conference | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 =  Francis | last2 = Bollen | first2 = J. | date = 1996 | title = The World-Wide Web as a Super-Brain: from metaphor to model | editor-first = R. | editor-last = Trappl  | conference = Cybernetics and Systems' 96 | publisher = Austrian Society For Cybernetics | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/WWW-Super-Brain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy becomes stronger with the rise of [[social media]], such as [[Facebook]], where links between personal pages represent relationships in a [[social network]] along which information propagates from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinbaum | first = D. | date = 2012 | title = A Framework for Scalable Cognition: Propagation of challenges, towards the implementation of Global Brain models | publisher = GBI working paper 2012-02 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ECCO/ECCO-Papers/Weaver-Attention.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such propagation is similar to the [[spreading activation]] that [[neural networks]] in the brain use to process information in a parallel, distributed manner.

==History==
Although some of the underlying ideas were already expressed by [[Nikola Tesla]] in the late 19th century and were written about by many others before him,  the term “global brain” was coined in 1982 by [[Peter Russell (writer)|Peter Russell]] in his book ''The Global Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Peter Russell (physicist) | last = Russell | first = P. | date = 1983 | title = The Global Brain: speculations on the evolutionary leap to planetary consciousness | location = Los Angeles | publisher = JP Tarcher }}&lt;/ref&gt; How the Internet might be developed to achieve this was set out in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Andrews | first = D. | date =  February 1986 | title = Information routeing groups – Towards the global superbrain: or how to find out what you need to know rather than what you think you need to know | journal = Journal of Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–35 | doi=10.1057/jit.1986.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by [[Gottfried Mayer-Kress]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer-Kress | first1 = G. | last2 = Barczys | first2 = C. | date = 1995 | title = The global brain as an emergent structure from the Worldwide Computing Network, and its implications for modeling | journal = The information society | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–27 | url = http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | doi = 10.1080/01972243.1995.9960177 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120907044231/http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | archivedate = 2012-09-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the first [[algorithms]] that could turn the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Johan Bollen]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Bollen | first1 = J. | authorlink2 = Francis Heylighen | last2 = Heylighen | first2 = Francis | date = 1996 | title = Algorithms for the self-organization of distributed, multi-user networks.

Reviewing the strands of intellectual history that contributed to the global brain hypothesis, [[Francis Heylighen]] distinguishes four perspectives: ''“organicism”'', ''“encyclopedism”'', ''“emergentism”'' and ''“evolutionary cybernetics”''. He asserts that these developed in relative independence but now are converging in his own scientific re-formulation.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 = Francis | date = 2011 | chapterurl = http://pcp.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf | chapter = Conceptions of a Global Brain: an historical review | title = Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social | editor1-last = Grinin | editor1-first = L.

V. | editor4-last = Spier | editor4-first = F.  | publisher = Uchitel Publishing | pages = 274–289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organicism ===
In the 19th century, the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] saw society as a [[social organism]] and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler|William Wheeler]] developed the concept of the ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term [[superorganism]] to describe such an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = William Morton Wheeler | last = Wheeler | first = William | date = 1911 | title = The Ant Colony as an Organism | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 22 | pages = 307–325 | doi=10.1002/jmor.1050220206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as [[Gregory Stock]] in his book [[Metaman]] and [[Joel de Rosnay]] to describe planetary society as a superorganism.

The mental aspects of such an organic system at the planetary level were perhaps first broadly elaborated by palaeontologist and Jesuit priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In 1945, he described a coming “planetisation” of humanity, which he saw as the next phase of accelerating human “socialisation”. Teilhard described both socialization and planetization as irreversible, irresistible processes of ''macrobiological development'' culminating in the emergence of a [[noosphere]], or global mind (see Emergentism below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap VII – The Planetisation of Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[living systems theory]] describes both organisms and social systems in terms of the "critical subsystems" ("organs") they need to contain in order to survive, such as an internal transport system, a resource reserve, and a decision-making system. This theory has inspired several thinkers, including Peter Russell and Francis Heylighen to define the global brain as the network of information processing subsystems for the planetary social system.

=== Encyclopedism ===
In the perspective of encyclopedism, the emphasis is on developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. However, by the end of the 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, [[Paul Otlet]] founded the science of documentation, now called [[information science]]. In the 1930s he envisaged a [[World Wide Web]]-like system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. [[H. G. Wells]] proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a [[World Brain]], as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet, although the image of humanity acting informally as a more organic global brain is a recurring motif in other of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=H.G. Wells | title=The New Machiavelli| quote="But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking them! ... And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain; — the ideas go on — as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], too, was inspired by the free-associative possibilities of the brain for his invention. The brain can link different kinds of information without any apparent link otherwise; Berners-Lee thought that computers could become much more powerful if they could imitate this functioning, i.e. make links between any arbitrary piece of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Berners-Lee|1999|pp=4, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful implementation of encyclopedism to date is Wikipedia, which integrates the associative powers of the world-wide-web with the collective intelligence of its millions of contributors, approaching the ideal of a global memory.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"/&gt; The [[Semantic web]], also first proposed by Berners-Lee, is a system of protocols to make the pieces of knowledge and their links readable by machines, so that they could be used to make automatic [[inference]]s, thus providing this brain-like network with some capacity for autonomous "thinking" or reflection.

=== Emergentism ===
This approach focuses on the emergent aspects of the evolution and development of [[complexity]], including the spiritual, psychological, and moral-ethical aspects of the global brain, and is at present the most speculative approach. The global brain is here seen as a natural and emergent process of planetary evolutionary development. Here again [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] attempted a synthesis of science, social values, and religion in his [[The Phenomenon of Man]], which argues that the ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (drive, purpose) of universal evolutionary process is the development of greater levels of both complexity and consciousness. Teilhard proposed that if life persists then planetization, as a biological process producing a global brain, would necessarily also produce a global mind, a new level of planetary consciousness and a technologically supported network of thoughts which he called the ''[[noosphere]]''. Teilhard's proposed technological layer for the noosphere can be interpreted as an early anticipation of the Internet and the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap X – The Formation of the Noosphere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and philosopher [[Peter Russell (physicist)|Peter Russell]] elaborates a similar view, and stresses the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism. This approach is most popular in [[New Age]] circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems.

===Evolutionary cybernetics===
[[Systems theory|Systems theorists]] and [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] commonly describe the emergence of a higher order system in evolutionary development as a “[[metasystem transition]]” (a concept introduced by [[Valentin Turchin]]) or a “major evolutionary transition”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The major evolutionary transitions | authorlink1 = Eörs Szathmáry | first1 = Eörs | last1 = Szathmáry | authorlink2 = John Maynard Smith | first2 = John | last2 = Maynard Smith | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 374 | pages = 227–232 | date = 16 March 1995 | doi = 10.1038/374227a0 | pmid=7885442| bibcode = 1995Natur.374..227S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a metasystem consists of a group of subsystems that work together in a coordinated, goal-directed manner. It is as such much more powerful and intelligent than its constituent systems. [[Francis Heylighen]] has argued that the global brain is an emerging metasystem with respect to the level of individual human intelligence, and investigated the specific evolutionary mechanisms that promote this transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2008 | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf | chapter = Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain | title = Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change | publisher = Routledge | page = 284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the Internet fulfils the role of the network of “nerves” that interconnect the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of [[self-organization]] through which such coordination and [[collective intelligence]] emerges.

== Recent developments ==
In 1994 [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], in his popular book ''[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of Control]]'', posited the emergence of a "[[Collective consciousness|hive mind]]" from a discussion of cybernetics and evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=ooc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Addison-Wesley| isbn = 0201577933| authorlink = Kevin Kelly (editor) | last = Kelly | first = Kevin| title = [[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization]]| location = Reading, Mass| date = 1994| pages = 5–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Ben Goertzel]] founded the Global Brain group, a discussion forum grouping most of the researchers that had been working on the subject of the global brain to further investigate this phenomenon. The group organized the first international conference on the topic in 2001 at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

After a period of relative neglect, the Global Brain idea has recently seen a resurgence in interest, in part due to talks given on the topic by [[Tim O'Reilly]], the Internet forecaster who popularized the term [[Web 2.0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | authorlink = Tim O'Reilly | first = Tim | last = O'Reilly | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/video/2012/03/22/towards-global-brain?ms=42144 | title = Towards a Global Brain | series = One Great Idea | date = March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuri Milner]], the social media investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Chrystia | last = Freeland | website = blogs.reuters.com | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ | title = The advent of the global brain }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the Global Brain Institute (GBI) was founded at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] to develop a mathematical theory of the “brainlike” propagation of information across the Internet. In the same year, [[Thomas W. Malone]] and collaborators from the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]]  have started to explore how the global brain could be “programmed” to work more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Klein | first2 = M. | authorlink3 = Thomas W. Malone | last3 = Malone | first3 = Thomas W. | date = 2012 | title = Programming the Global Brain | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | page = 41 | url = http://cci.mit.edu/publications/CCIwp2011-04.pdf | doi=10.1145/2160718.2160731}}&lt;/ref&gt; using mechanisms of [[collective intelligence]]. The complexity scientist [[Dirk Helbing]] and his NervousNet group have recently started developing a "Planetary Nervous System", which includes a "Global Participatory Platform", as part of the large-scale [[FuturICT]] project, thus preparing some of the groundwork for a Global Brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Dirk Helbing | last1 = Helbing | first1 = Dirk | date = 2015 | chapter = Creating (“Making”) a Planetary Nervous System as Citizen Web | title = Thinking Ahead – Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society | pages = 189–194 | publisher = Springer International Publishing | chapterurl = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15078-9_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 [[Elon Musk]] founded the company [[Neuralink]], which aims to create a Neural Lace, which is a concept invented by the novelist [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]] and basically refers to a machine interface woven into the brain, to allow the user to access all available human information. A core driver behind this business idea is Mr Musk’s argument, that human beings soon have to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by [[artificial intelligence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719774-do-human-beings-need-embrace-brain-implants-stay-relevant-elon-musk-enters|title=Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm raised $27m from 12 Investors in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-startup-a7916891.html|title=Elon Musk could be about to spend $100m linking human brains to computers|date=2017-08-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
A common criticism of the idea that humanity would become directed by a global brain is that this would reduce individual diversity and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayward | first = W. B. | date = 1999 | title = H. G. Wells' s idea of a World Brain: A critical reassessment | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 7 | pages = 557–573 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.85.1010 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:7&lt;557::aid-asi2&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lead to [[mass surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brooks | first = M. | date = June 24, 2000 | url = http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0006/msg00182.html | title = Global brain | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2244 | page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is inspired by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] forms of government, as exemplified by [[George Orwell|George Orwell']]s character of "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]". It is also inspired by the analogy between collective intelligence or [[swarm intelligence]] and [[insect societies]], such as beehives and ant colonies, in which individuals are essentially interchangeable. In a more extreme view, the global brain has been compared with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goertzel | first = Ben | date = 2002 | title = Creating Internet Intelligence: Wild computing, distributed digital consciousness, and the emerging global brain | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | url = {{google books|id=Vnzb-xLdvv8C|plainurl=yes}} | isbn = 9780306467356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the race of collectively thinking cyborgs conceived by the [[Star Trek]] science fiction franchise.

Global brain theorists reply that the emergence of distributed intelligence would lead to the exact opposite of this vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2007 | title = The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society | journal = Social Evolution &amp; History | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–119 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/Superorganism.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2002 | chapter = Das Globale Gehirn als neue Utopia |trans-chapter=The global brain as a new utopia | publisher = Suhrkamp | location = Frankurt | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-Utopia.pdf | editor1-first = R. | editor1-last = Maresch | editor2-first = F. | editor2-last = Rötzer | title = Renaissance der Utopie }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that effective [[collective intelligence]] requires [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] of opinion, [[decentralization]] and individual independence, as demonstrated by [[James Surowiecki]] in his book [[The Wisdom of Crowds]]. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.

In theory, taking into account [[cultural differences]] and country-specific conditions, it deals with the [[epidemiology]] of [[mental disorder]]s in different countries, their treatment options, mental health education, political and financial aspects, the structure of mental [[health care]] systems, [[Health human resources|human resources]] in mental health, and [[human rights]] issues among others.

The overall aim of the field of global mental health is to strengthen mental health all over the world by providing information about the mental health situation in all countries, and identifying mental health care needs in order to develop cost-effective interventions to meet those specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0|pmid= 17804063|year= 2007|author1= Prince|first1= M|title= No health without mental health|journal= Lancet|volume= 370|issue= 9590|pages= 859–77|last2= Patel|first2= V|last3= Saxena|first3= S|last4= Maj|first4= M|last5= Maselko|first5= J|last6= Phillips|first6= M.

Mental, [[neurological]], and substance use disorders make a substantial contribution to the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]] (GBD).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthinfo/bod/en/index.html ''Global burden of disease'']. Geneva, WHO Health statistics and health information systems. Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a global measure of so-called [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALY's) assigned to a certain disease/disorder, which is a sum of the years lived with disability and years of life lost due to this disease within the total population.  [[Neuropsychiatry|Neuropsychiatric]] conditions account for 14% of the global burden of disease. Among [[non-communicable disease]]s, they account for 28% of the DALY's – more than [[cardiovascular disease]] or [[cancer]]. However, it is estimated that the real contribution of [[mental disorders]] to the global burden of disease is even higher, due to the complex interactions and co-morbidity of physical and mental illness.

Around the world, almost one million people die due to suicide every year, and it is the third leading cause of death among young people. The most important causes of disability due to health-related conditions worldwide include [[unipolar depression]], [[alcoholism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar depression]] and [[dementia]]. In low- and middle-income countries, these conditions represent a total of 19.1% of all disability related to health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/mhtargeting/development_targeting_mh_summary.pdf ''Mental Health and Development: Targeting People with Mental Health Conditions as Vulnerable Group''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment gap ==
It is estimated that one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/index.html ''Mental disorders affect one in four people.''] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many effective interventions for the treatment of mental disorders are known, and awareness of the need for treatment of people with mental disorders has risen, the proportion of those who need mental health care but who do not receive it remains very high.  This so-called "treatment gap" is estimated to reach between 76–85% for low- and middle-income countries, and 35–50% for high-income countries.

Despite the acknowledged need, for the most part there have not been substantial changes in mental health care delivery during the past years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turekian|first1=Vaughan|title=Mental Health Diplomacy|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=2014-06-23|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/editorial/2014/mental-health-diplomacy-building-global-response}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main reasons for this problem are public health priorities, lack of a mental health policy and legislation in many countries, a lack of resources – financial and human resources – as well as inefficient resource allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X|title=Barriers to improvement of mental health services in low-income and middle-income countries|journal=The Lancet|volume=370|issue=9593|pages=1164–1174|year=2007|last1=Saraceno|first1=Benedetto|last2=Van Ommeren|first2=Mark|last3=Batniji|first3=Rajaie|last4=Cohen|first4=Alex|last5=Gureje|first5=Oye|last6=Mahoney|first6=John|last7=Sridhar|first7=Devi|last8=Underhill|first8=Chris | pmid = 17804061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the World Health Organization estimated a shortage of 1.18 million [[mental health professional]]s, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000
nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries. The annual wage bill to remove this [[Health Human Resources|health workforce]] shortage was estimated at about US$4.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffler RM et al. (2011). [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501019_eng.pdf ''Human resources for mental health: workforce shortages in low- and middle-income countries'']. Geneva, World Health Organization Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interventions ==
Information and evidence about cost-effective interventions to provide better mental health care are available.  Although most of the research (80%) has been carried out in high-income countries, there is also strong evidence from low- and middle-income countries that [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] and [[psychosocial]] interventions are effective ways to treat mental disorders, with the strongest evidence for depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hazardous alcohol use.

Recommendations to strengthen mental health systems around the world have been first mentioned in the WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2001'']],&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2001) [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/en/index.html ''The world health report 2001 – Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope'']. Geneva, WHO Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on mental health:

# Provide treatment in primary care
# Make [[psychotropic drug]]s available
# Give care in the community
# Educate the public
# Involve communities, families and consumers
# Establish national policies, programs and [[legislation]]
# Develop [[Health Human Resources|human resources]]
# Link with other sectors
# Monitor community mental health
# Support more research

Based on the data of 12 countries, assessed by the ''WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems'' (WHO-AIMS),&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/WHO-AIMS/en/''Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the costs of scaling up mental health services by providing a core treatment package for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive episodes and hazardous alcohol use have been estimated. Structural changes in mental health systems according to the WHO recommendations have been taken into account.

For most countries, this model suggests an initial period of investment of US$0.30 – 0.50 per person per year. The total expenditure on mental health would have to rise at least ten-fold in low-income countries. In those countries, additional financial resources will be needed, while in middle- and high-income countries the main challenge will be the reallocation of resources within the health system to provide better mental health service.

==Prevention==

Prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 WHO report "Prevention of Mental Disorders", the 2008 EU "Pact for Mental Health" and the 2011 US National Prevention Strategy. NIMH or the National Institute of Mental Health has over 400 grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/research-areas/index.shtml|title=NIMH » Research Areas|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders==

=== World Health Organization (WHO) ===

Two of WHO's core programmes for mental health are WHO MIND (Mental health improvements for Nations Development) and Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).

WHO MIND focuses on 5 areas of action to ensure concrete changes in people's daily lives.  These are:
#  Action in and support to countries to improve mental health, such as the WHO Pacific Island Mental Health network (PIMHnet)
#  Mental health policy, planning and service development
#  Mental health human rights and legislation
#  Mental health as a core part of human development
#  The QualityRights Project which works to unite and empower people to improve the quality of care and promote human rights in mental health facilities and social care homes.

Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) is WHO’s action plan to scale up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders for countries especially with low and lower middle incomes. The aim of mhGAP is to build partnerships for collective action and to reinforce the commitment of governments, international organizations and other stakeholders.

The mhGAP Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) was launched in October 2010.  It is a technical tool for the management of mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialist health settings.  The priority conditions included are: depression, psychosis, bipolar disorders, epilepsy, developmental and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents, dementia, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-harm/suicide and other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints.

== Criticism ==

One of the most prominent critics of the Movement for Global Mental Health has been China Mills, author of the book ''Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World''.

Mills writes that:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mills, China. [https://www.academia.edu/4905979/Decolonizing_Global_Mental_Health_The_Psychiatrization_of_the_Majority_World Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World]. Retrieved October 17, 2014, from&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=This book charts the creeping of psychology and psychiatry across the borders of everyday experience and across geographical borders, as a form of colonialism that comes from within and from outside, swallowed in the form of a pill. It maps an anxious space where socio-economic crises come to be reconfigured as individual crisis – as 'mental illness'; and how potentially violent interventions come to be seen as 'essential' treatment.|sign=|source=}}

Another prominent critic is Ethan Watters, author of ''Crazy Like Us: The Globalization of the American Psyche''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Watters, Ethan (January 8, 2010).

'''Global politics''', also known as '''world politics''',{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=273}} names both the discipline that studies the political and economical patterns of the world and the field that is being studied. At the centre of that field are the different processes of [[political globalization]] in relation to questions of social power.

The discipline studies the relationships between cities, [[nation-states]], shell-states, [[multinational corporations]], [[non-governmental organizations]] and [[international organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Jan-Erik Lane, ''Globalization and Politics: Promises and Dangers'', Aldershot, Ashgate, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Current areas of discussion include national and [[ethnic]] conflict regulation, [[democracy]] and the politics of national [[self-determination]], [[globalization]] and its relationship to democracy, conflict and peace studies, [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]], and the [[international political economy]] of the environment. One important area of global politics is contestation in the global political sphere over legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= van Seeters | first2= Paul | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 2: Global Social Movements and Global Civil Society | url= https://www.academia.edu/7305007/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._2_Global_Social_Movements_and_Global_Civil_Society_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global politics is said by some to be distinct from the field of international politics (commonly seen as a branch of [[international relations]]{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=273}}), as it "does not stress the primacy of intergovernmental relations and transactions".{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=578}} This distinction however has not always been held among authors and political scientists, who often use the term "international politics" to mean global politics.{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=273}}

==Defining the field==
Beginning in the late nineteenth century, several groups extended the definition of the political community beyond nation-states to include much, if not all, of humanity. These "internationalists" include [[Marxists]], human rights advocates, environmentalists, peace activists, [[feminists]], and [[dalits]]. This was the general direction of thinking on global politics, though the term was not used as such.&lt;ref name="Vol4"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global | url= https://www.academia.edu/7547819/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._4_Political_Philosophies_of_the_Global_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | pages= x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern "world politics perspective" is often identified with the works of [[Joseph Nye]] and [[Robert Keohane]], in particular their 1972 work ''Transnational Relations and World Politics''. Here, the authors argued that state-centric views of international relations were inadequate frameworks to utilize in political science or international relations studies due to the increased globalization.{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=578}} Today, the practices of global politics are defined by values: norms of [[human rights]], ideas of [[human development (humanity)|human development]], and beliefs such as [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalism]] or [[cosmopolitanism]] about how we should relate to each. Over the last couple of decades cosmopolitanism has become one of the key contested ideologies of global politics:
{{cquote| Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.&lt;ref name="Vol4" /&gt;}}

== Debates ==

The intensification of [[globalization]] led some writers to suggest that states were no longer relevant to global politics.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Horsman and Andrew Marshall, After the Nation-State, London, Harper Collins, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been subject to debate:

{{cquote| On the other hand, other commentators have been arguing that states have remained essential to global politics. They have facilitated globalizing processes and projects; not been eclipsed by them. They have been rejuvenated because, among other reasons, they are still the primary providers of (military) security in the global arena; they are still the paramount loci for articulating the voices of (procedurally democratic) national communities, and for ordering their interactions with similar polities; and finally, they are indispensable to relations of (unequal) economic exchange insofar as they legitimize and enforce the global legal frameworks that enable globalization in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._1_Global_Political_and_Legal_Governance_2014_| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xlii}}; AG McGrew and PG Lewis, ''Global Politics'', Cambridge, Polity Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6278">'''Global Production Networks (GPN)''' is a concept in [[economic development|development]]al literature which refers to "the nexus of interconnected functions, operations and transactions through which a specific [[product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] is produced, [[Distribution (business)|distributed]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]]."&lt;ref name=Coe/&gt;

== Global Production Networks ==
A [[globalization|global]] production network is one whose interconnected nodes and links extend spatially across national boundaries and, in so doing, integrates parts of disparate national and [[subnational]] territories".&lt;ref name=Coe&gt;{{citation|title=Global production networks: Realizing the potential|journal=Journal of Economic Geography|volume=8|issue=3|pages=271–295|year=2008|last1=Coe|first1=N.

== Historical development of concept ==
In 1990s the concept of [[value chain]] gained its credit among economists and business scholars. (Its prominent developer [[Michael Porter]]). The concept combined sequenced and interconnected activities in the process of value creation. Value chain concept focused on business activities, but not on the corporate power and institutional context. In 1994 Garry Gereffi, together with Miguel Korzeniewicz introduced the concept of Global Commodity Chains (GCC):

{{quote|sets of interorganizational networks clustered around one commodity or product, linking households, enterprises, and states to one another within the world-economy. These networks are situationally specific, socially constructed, and locally integrated, underscoring the social embeddedness of economic organization|Gereffi&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, G. (1994) ‘The organisation of buyer-driven global commodity chains: how US retailers shape overseas production networks’, in G. Gereffi and M. Korzeniewicz (eds), Commodity Chains and Global Development. Westport: Praeger, pp. 95–122: 2&lt;/ref&gt;}} The concept was developed further by a number of authors that emphasized importance of chain governance in different commodities (e.g. automobiles, textile, electronics etc.)

At the beginning of 2000s a group of authors Jeffrey Henderson, Peter Dicken, Martin Hess, Neil Coe and Henry Wai-Chung Yeung, introduced GPN framework, that builds on the development of previous approaches to international production processes. At the same time it expands beyond the linearity of GCC approach to incorporate all kinds of network configuration. Adopting clear network perspective allows to embrace the complexity of multidimensional layers of production moving beyond the "linear progression of the product or service"&lt;ref&gt;Neil M. Coe, Peter Dicken, and Martin Hess, “Global Production Networks: Realizing the Potential,” Journal of Economic Geography 8, no. 3 (May 1, 2008): 271–95, doi:10.1093/jeg/lbn002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insights from the analysis of production networks ==
Analysis of the global production networks relies on the use of the input-output tables that links firms through the transactions involved in the product creation. Commodity chain literature considers firms as the nodes in a number of chains that transform inputs into outputs through a series of interconnected stages of production, later linked to distribution and consumption activities. Andersen and Christensen define five major types of connective nodes in supply networks: Local integrator, Export base, Import base, International spanner and Global integrator &lt;ref&gt;Poul Houman Andersen and Poul Rind Christensen, “Bridges over Troubled Water: Suppliers as Connective Nodes in Global Supply Networks,” Journal of Business Research 58, no. 9 (September 2005): 1261–73, doi:10.1016/j.jbusres.2003.04.002.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobday et al. argue that the core capability of the firms stem from their ability to manage network of components and subsystem suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Hobday, M., Davies, A., Prencipe, A. (2005) Systems integration: a core capability of the modern corporation. Industrial and Corporate Change, 14: 1109–1143.&lt;/ref&gt;

To capture both vertical and horizontal links across the sequence of production process, Lazzarini introduced the concept of Netchain: "a set of networks {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} horizontal ties between firms within a particular industry or group, which are sequentially arranged based on vertical ties between firms in different layers ... Netchain analysis explicitly differentiates between horizontal (transactions in the same layer) and vertical ties (transactions between layers), mapping how agents in each layer are related to each other and to agents in other layers".&lt;ref&gt;Lazzarini, S., Chaddad, F. R., Cook, M. L. (2000) Integrating supply chain and network analysis: the study of netchains. Journal on Chain and Network Science, 1: 7–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical studies have explored production networks in the domain of ethics of production, for instance focusing on local effects or labor relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=M.|date=2016-02-18|title=Global Production in a Romanian Village: Middle-Income Economy, Industrial Dislocation and the Reserve Army of Labor|journal=Critical Sociology|volume=43|issue=7–8|pages=1079–1092|language=en|doi=10.1177/0896920515623076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning medical geography within the field of [[social geography]] due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well-being in general.  Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]]) are studied by the [[medicine]] researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without [[medical education]]. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].&lt;ref name= "Philo2"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name= "Philo"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Medical Geography". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.&lt;ref name= "Philo" /&gt; A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]]. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ocaña-Riola |first=Ricardo |year=2010 |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |pmid=20503184 |url=http://www.geospatialhealth.unina.it/fulltext.php?f=pdf&amp;ida=90 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1353-8292(95)00002-4 | title=Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography | journal=Health | date=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | first=Andréa | last=Litva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographies of disease and ill health ===
Hsenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and other potential dangers.&lt;ref name="Philo2" /&gt;

=== Geography of health care provision ===
[[File:Coverage by Type of Health Insurance- 2008 and 2009p25.pdf|thumb]]
Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]]. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/money-quality-health-care-longer-life/|title=The costs of inequality: Money = quality health care = longer life|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility and Disease Tracking

With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track [[individual mobility]]. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While [[privacy law]]s question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people .

The '''Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation''' ('''IHME''') is a research institute working in the area of [[global health]] statistics and impact evaluation at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle. The Institute is headed by Dr. [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], a physician and health economist, and professor at the [[University of Washington Department of Global Health]], which is part of the [[School of Medicine]]. IHME's goal, as stated on the Institute's website, is "to identify the best strategies to build a healthier world. By measuring health, tracking program performance, finding ways to maximize health system impact, and developing innovative measurement systems, IHME provides a foundation for informed decision-making that ultimately will lead to better health globally" IHME (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Heath Metrics and Evaluation|url=http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/research|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IHME conducts research and trains scientists, policymakers, and the public in health metrics concepts, methods, and tools. Its mission includes judging the effectiveness and efficacy of health initiatives and national health systems. IHME's work seeks to be complementary to the [[United Nations]]' work in the [[World Health Organization]] in that it shares many tasks but is independent from member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNiel|first1=Donal|title=Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=New York Times|date=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008_doughton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doughton|first1=Sandi|title=Seattle institute aims to help cure world-health data disorder|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-institute-aims-to-help-cure-world-health-data-disorder/|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=Seattle Times|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IHME gathers health-related data from all available sources. It develops innovative analytical tools to track trends in mortality, diseases, and risk factors, and capsulizes many of its research findings in data visualizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Visualizations|url=http://www.healthdata.org/results/data-visualizations|website=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It evaluates interventions such as vaccines, malaria control policies, cancer screenings, and birth care. To enable researchers to replicate IHME's work and to foster new research, IHME created the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) where methods and results are cataloged and freely accessible. IHME is also committed to expanding the field of health metrics by training students at the post-baccalaureate and post-graduate levels.

==History==

IHME was launched in June 2007 based on a core grant of $105 million primarily funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=$105 million Gates gift helps start global health center|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/105-million-Gates-gift-helps-start-global-1239473.php|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=Seattle PI|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its earliest projects was to produce new estimates of mortality rates, which were published in ''The Lancet'' in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=CJL|last2=Laakso|first2=T|last3=Shibuya|first3=K|last4=Lopez|first4=AD|title=Can we achieve Millennium Development Goal 4?

==Research==
IHME also has launched policy reports on a wide range of topics, including a June 2010 report on child and maternal mortality. The findings were updated in 2014. In 2009, IHME launched its series of Financing Global Health policy reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ravishankar|first1=N|last2=Gubbins|first2=P|last3=Cooley|first3=RJ|last4=Leach-Kemon|first4=K|last5=Michaud|first5=CM|last6=Jamison|first6=DT|last7=Murray|first7=CJL|title=Financing of global health: tracking development assistance for health from 1990 to 2007|journal=The Lancet|date=20 June 2009|volume=373|pages=2113–2124|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60881-3|pmid=19541038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=C|last2=Schneider|first2=MT|last3=Gubbins|first3=P|last4=Leach-Kemon|first4=K|last5=Jamison|first5=D|last6=Murray|first6=CJL|title=Public financing of health in developing countries: a cross-national systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=17 April 2010|volume=375|pages=1375–1387|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60233-4|pmid=20381856}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial report led to meetings with staff from the US House Foreign Affairs Committee and with a task force appointed by US President Barack Obama to guide the funding of his new Global Health Initiative. Annual updates have been published since then.

Recent publications have included estimations of causes of death worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-age-sex-specific-all-cause-and-cause-specific}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incidence of HIV, TB, and malaria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global, regional, and national incidence and mortality for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria during 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-incidence-and-mortality-hiv-tuberculosis-and-malaria |date=July 2014 |first1=Christopher J.L. |last1=Murray |first2=Theo |last2=Vos |first3=Alan |last3=Lopez |publisher=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as obesity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-prevalence-overweight-and-obesity-children-and-adults}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2960460-8/abstract|journal=The Lancet|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8|volume=384|year=2014|pages=766–781 | last1 = Ng | first1 = Marie|pmc=4624264}}&lt;/ref&gt; cigarette smoking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cigarette smoking prevalence in US counties: 1996- 2012|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/cigarette-smoking-prevalence-us-counties-1996-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; heart disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temporal trends in ischemic heart disease mortality in 21 world regions, 1980-2010: the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/temporal-trends-ischemic-heart-disease-mortality-21-world-regions-1980-2010-global}}&lt;/ref&gt; and small area estimation of diabetes rates in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Srebotnjak|first1=T|last2=Mokdad|first2=AH|last3=Murray|first3=CJL|title=A novel framework for validating and applying standardized small area measurement strategies|journal=Population Health Metrics|date=29 September 2010|url=http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/8/1/26|doi=10.1186/1478-7954-8-26|volume=8|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; IHME has also worked with other organizations on projects. For example, IHME researchers helped create the 2010 WHO World Malaria Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO: World Malaria Report 2010|url=http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating all the estimates for insecticide-treated nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gakidou|first1=E|last2=Cowling|first2=K|last3=Lozano|first3=R|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|volume=376|pages=959–974|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61257-3|pmid=20851260|year=2010}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 April 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; IHME has also collaborated on country-level research projects, including a partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to help create a health surveillance system to track disease trends and inform policy. 
There is a list of publications at IHME's website.

===Global Burden of Disease===
{{further|Global Burden of Disease Study}}

In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2010, a worldwide consortium of 500 researchers, coordinated by IHME measured the impact of more than 290 health conditions and 67 health risk factors worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The story of GBD 2010: a "super-human" effort|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2962174-6/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62174-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GBD enterprise produced estimates in 21 regions around the world for disability-adjusted life years by age and sex for the past two decades. Part of this research has involved conducting in-person surveys in several countries and gathering health information through a website survey. The team created a cause of death database that includes 60 years of data, or almost 800 million deaths. To illustrate the findings, IHME released a suite of interactive data visualizations, which are available to the public.

The aim is to allow policymakers and other decision-makers to "compare the effects of different diseases – such as cancer versus depression – that kill people prematurely and cause ill health," to show disease trends over time, and to inform policy, IHME states on its website.

It has been labeled "the most comprehensive review of the state of humanity's health ever undertaken."&lt;ref name="2013_doughton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doughton|first1=Sandi|title=Gates, UW teaming up on massive health study|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/gates-uw-teaming-up-on-massive-health-study/ |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]'' |date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK and China are among the countries working with IHME to generate subnational burden of disease estimates at the county and province levels.

In January 2014, IHME began releasing updates to the work, called the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2013. The work generated over 1 billion estimates of health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GBD History|url=http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; GBD estimates are now being updated annually.

Some of the findings have been controversial. In 2012, IHME researchers estimated 1.2 million people died from malaria in 2010, double the WHO's estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New estimates of malaria deaths: concern and opportunity|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960169-X/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60169-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelland|first1=Kate|title=Analysis: Health by numbers: A statistician's challenge|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-statistics-idUSBRE84D0KD20120514 |accessdate=January 25, 2017|agency=Reuters|date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease Control Priorities Network===

{{further|Disease Control Priorities Project}}

The Disease Control Priorities Network project generates cost-effectiveness estimates for a range of health interventions. A team of demographers, statisticians, economists, and other experts are studying how to improve the allocation of resources among interventions, technologies, hospitals, and other service delivery platforms. They are working in multiple countries, including the US, India, and South Africa.
Their cost-effectiveness work has revealed some hidden connections. For example, a 2010 report showed improving girls' education in poor countries is the most effective way to reduce child mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gakidou|first1=E|last2=Cowling|first2=K|last3=Lozano|first3=R|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=18 September 2010|volume=376|pages=959–974|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61257-3|pmid=20851260}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was a surprise for some people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulson|first1=Paul|title=Number crunchers say the evidence is: Transparency strengthens global health|url=http://www.humanosphere.org/basics/2011/06/number-crunchers-say-the-evidence-is-transparency-strengthens-global-health/|publisher=NPR Humanosphere|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effort launched in 2011 called Access, Bottlenecks, Costs, and Equity (ABCE) involves collecting evidence and analyzing data to improve the cost-effectiveness and equity of health systems in Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lebanon, Uganda, and Zambia. The project examines four components that affect health care delivery: access (to health facilities), bottlenecks (limitations on the supply side), costs, and equity (across populations). The work includes in-depth facility surveys and inventories across a range of service delivery platforms; additional data is collected in countries with high HIV/AIDS burdens through exit interviews and chart extraction.

A 2013 report concluded that neonatal and maternal mortality in Ghana could be best improved not with sophisticated maternity care but with better transportation infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel time to maternity care and its effect on utilization in rural Ghana: a multilevel analysis|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/travel-time-maternity-care-and-its-effect-utilization-rural-ghana-multilevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population Health Metrics Research Consortium project===
The Population Health Metrics Research Consortium created new methods for tracking health intervention coverage in low-resource settings. The methods have been used to measure mortality, causes of death, and incidence of major illnesses where data are incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Health Metrics Research Consortium gold standard verbal autopsy validation study: design, implementation, and development of analysis datasets|url=https://www.healthdata.org/research-article/population-health-metrics-research-consortium-gold-standard-verbal-autopsy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers collected data in India, Mexico, the Philippines, and Tanzania.

IHME's work on estimating mortality has been at times controversial. In 2009, IHME published a study on maternal mortality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogan|first1=MC|last2=Foreman|first2=KJ|last3=Naghavi|first3=M|last4=Ahn|first4=SY|last5=Wang|first5=M|last6=Makela|first6=SM|last7=Lozano|first7=R|last8=Lopez|first8=AD|last9=Murray|first9=CJL|title=Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980-2008: a systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5|journal=The Lancet|date=8  May 2010|volume=375|pages=1609–1623|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60518-1|pmid=20382417}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some advocacy groups tried to suppress – worried that results showing a decline in mortality would make it harder to fund-raise. The WHO also initially disagreed with the new results, but later revised their estimates in agreement with those of IHME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=Number crunchers say the evidence is: Transparency strengthens global health|url=http://www.humanosphere.org/basics/2011/06/number-crunchers-say-the-evidence-is-transparency-strengthens-global-health/|publisher=NPR Humanosphere|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaria Control Policy Assessment project===

The Malaria Control Policy Assessment project evaluates the effectiveness of malaria-control interventions in Uganda and Zambia by analyzing their effect on child mortality and producing estimates at the national and local levels.

===United States public health research===

IHME conducts US research, including estimates of mortality, life expectancy, risk factors, health disparities, and disease prevalence. IHME has compiled national and local health trends and integrated multiple data sources to monitor disparities in chronic diseases.

A 2013 report, the State of US Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of US Health: Innovations, Insights, and Recommendations from the Global Burden of Disease Study|url=http://www.healthdata.org/policy-report/state-us-health-innovations-insights-and-recommendations-global-burden-disease-study|website=IHME}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at trends in premature deaths due to injury or disease, and demonstrated the major health threat stemming from behavioral risk factors such as poor diet and sedentary lifestyles. It concluded that dietary factors cause more deaths each year than cancer or smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The State of US Health, 1990-2010 Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors|journal=JAMA|date=10 July 2013|volume=310|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1710486|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.13805|pages=591–608|pmid=23842577|pmc=5436627 | last1 = Murray | first1 = CJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results included life expectancy trends broken down by state and county.

First Lady Michelle Obama cited the research in her campaign to improve Americans' diets and increase their level of physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Diet Important For Increasing Years of Healthy Life, New Study Says|url=http://www.letsmove.gov/blog/2013/07/11/healthy-diet-important-increasing-years-healthy-life-new-study-says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published in the journal Population Health Metrics in June 2011 showed that life expectancy was rising in some poorer US counties – especially in the South&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulkarni|first1=SC|last2=Levin-Rector|first2=A|last3=Ezzati Murray CJL.|first3=M|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Falling behind: life expectancy in US counties from 2000 to 2007 in an international context|journal=Population Health Metrics|date=15 June 2011|url=http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/9/1/16|doi=10.1186/1478-7954-9-16|volume=9|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a surprising result which was widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pallarito|first1=Karen|title=Life expectancy in U.S. trails top nations|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/15/life.expectancy.united.states/|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=CNN|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research projects include the Salud Mesoamérica 2015 Initiative, which focuses on inequalities in health outcomes and access in southern Mexico and Central America; Gavi Full Country Evaluations, which evaluates immunization programs in Bangladesh, India, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia; and HealthRise, a partnership with Medtronic Philanthropy to evaluate programs targeting diabetes and heart disease, and sponsor small grants to make improvements.

In 2014, IHME announced the establishment of the University of Washington Center for Demography and Economics of Aging, funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). It is one of 14 NIA Demography Centers at leading universities and policy organizations around the United States.

===Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx)===

In March 2011, IHME launched the Global Health Data Exchange (or GHDx), which indexes and hosts information about microdata, aggregated data, and research results with a focus on health-related and demographic datasets. At launch, the site listed about 1,000 datasets; as of 2015, there are more than 30,000. As part of a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), GHDx includes 35 years of CDC data on child and maternal health. GHDx uses the Drupal 7 open source content management system and Apache SOLR for search. The site includes visualization and GIS tools, and has been noted by the health and global health communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Dam|first1=Andrew|title=Institute launches global health data clearinghouse|url=http://healthjournalism.org/blog/2011/04/institute-launches-global-health-data-clearinghouse/|publisher=Association of Health Care Journalists|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degree Programs==
IHME offers two types of global health fellowships, plus master's degrees and PhD programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Programs in Health Metrics and Evaluation|url=http://www.healthdata.org/get-involved/degree-programs|website=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funders==
IHME receives core grant funding from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=$105 million Gates' gift helps start global health center|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/105-million-Gates-gift-helps-start-global-1239473.php|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=Seattle PI|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of Washington. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Inter-American Development Bank; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health; Medtronic Philanthropy; and the National Institute on Aging have also contributed funding through project grants and contracts.

==Reception==

Initially, some within the [[World Health Organization]] had criticized IHME for trying to do the work that WHO already does. There had also been tension between [[UNICEF]] and IHME because a report from the latter showed "lackluster progress" on child death rates.&lt;ref name="2008_doughton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017_doughton" /&gt;

The 2010 Global Burden of Disease report was criticized for its lack of transparency of methods and data as well as its use of complex statistical methods to fill in data gaps when reliable statistics were unavailable. Thomas Bollyky, a senior fellow at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], called for more transparency. The report was also criticized for its use of [[Verbal autopsy|verbal autopsies]] because many diseases have similar symptoms, leading to potential mistakes.&lt;ref name="2013_doughton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/verbal-autopsy |title=Verbal Autopsy (VA) |publisher=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igor Rudan and Kit Yee Chan argue that the emergence of IHME introduced competition to the field of global health metrics, which was previously a field where WHO maintained a monopoly: "The GBD initiative has emerged as a well-organised and rapidly growing collaboration that is now seriously challenging WHO's role in generating global health estimates".&lt;ref name="2014_rudan"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3406781/RudanComment2013GBD.pdf |first1=Igor |last1=Rudan |first2=Kit Yee |last2=Chan |title=Global health metrics needs collaboration and competition |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62006-7 |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=385 |pages=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudan and Chan also note that IHME "struggled to generate support, legitimacy, and acceptable for their findings" after publishing the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study, due to concerns of lack of transparency, as well as the existence of parallel estimates of disease burden from WHO.&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;

The World Health Organization did not acknowledge the GBD 2010 estimates.&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017_doughton" /&gt;

The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2013 expanded collaboration and increased transparency but "[fell] short of allowing full independent replication of all results".&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;

IACA was launched in 2010 by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], Interpol, the [[European Anti-Fraud Office]] (OLAF), the Republic of Austria, and other stake-holders to help implement the [[UN Convention against Corruption]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: UK backs new corruption-fighting academy - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-backs-new-corruption-fighting-academy|work=www.gov.uk|date=3 September 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As fo 2013,  61 countries had signed the IACA membership agreement, and 38 of those had ratified it.&lt;ref name=Zeit2013/&gt; There was no fee for membership.&lt;ref name=News2016/&gt;  IACA started its first Masters program in February 2013; at that time the tuition was 24,700 euros and the coursework was run in seven twelve-day blocks, taken over two years.&lt;ref name=Zeit2013&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gottsauner-Wolf |first1=Moritz |last2=Zotter |first2=Christoph |title=Wo die Korruptionsjäger büffeln |publisher=[[Die Zeit]] |url=https://www.zeit.de/2013/06/Antikorruptionsakademie-Laxenburg-Oesterreich/komplettansicht |date=31 January 2013 |language=de |accessdate=2018-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian news magazine, ''[[NEWS (Austrian magazine)|News]]'', reported that IACA posted a budget of €12.98 million for the 2014 financial year and a budget of €13.24M for 2015; while noting that the actual revenues for 2013 were €2.3M and expenditures were around €2.1M.&lt;ref name=News2016/&gt; IACA told the ''News'' that the higher numbers were based on their fund-raising goals.&lt;ref name=News2016/&gt; At the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 IACA underwent a turnover in staff.&lt;ref name=News2016&gt;{{cite news|title=Das Luftschloss: Über die Internationale Anti-Korruptionsakademie|url=https://www.news.at/a/luftschloss-internationale-korruptionsakademie|work=News.at|date=16 February 2016|language=de|last=Melichar|first= Stefan|accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5292">The '''International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations''' ('''ISCSC''') is an international scholarly organization dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of [[civilizations]].  Based at [[Western Michigan University]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/humfig/11217607.0001.204/--politics-in-a-world-of-civilizations-long-term-perspectives?rgn=main;view=fulltext| title=Politics in a World of Civilizations: Long-term Perspectives on Relations between Peoples|author=Brett Bowden|publisher=''Human Figurations: Long-term Perspectives on the Human Condition'', Volume 1, Issue 2|date=July 2012|accessdate=August 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ISCSC holds an annual conference and publishes the journal ''[[Comparative Civilizations Review]]''.

==Brief history==
In October 1961, in Salzburg, Austria, an extraordinary group of scholars gathered to create the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations. Among the 26 founding members from Austria, Germany, France, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Spain, Italy, England, Russia, the United States, China and Japan were such luminaries as Pitirim Sorokin and Arnold Toynbee.  For six days, the participants debated such topics as the definition of “civilization,” problems in the analysis of complex cultures, civilizational encounters in the past, the Orient versus the Occident, problems of universal history, theories of historiography, and the role of the “human sciences” in “globalization.”  The meeting was funded by the Austrian government, in cooperation with UNESCO, and received considerable press coverage.  Sorokin was elected the Society’s first president.  After several meetings in Europe, the advancing age of its founding members and the declining health of then president, Othmar F. Anderle, were important factors in the decision to transfer the Society to the United States.   Between 1968 and 1970 Roger Williams Wescott of Drew University facilitated that transition.  In 1971, the first annual meeting of the ISCSC (US) was held in Philadelphia.  Important participants in that meeting and in the Society’s activities during the next years included Benjamin Nelson (the Society’s first American president), Roger Wescott, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, David Wilkinson, Rushton Coulborn and C.P. Wolf.  In 1974, the Salzburg branch was formally dissolved, and from that year to the present there has been only one International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations (ISCSC). 

	The presidents of the ISCSC are, in order: In Europe, Pitirim Sorokin and Othmar Anderle; in the United States, Benjamin Nelson, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, Michael Palencia-Roth, Roger Wescott, Shuntaro Ito (from Japan), Wayne Bledsoe, Lee Daniel Snyder, Andrew Targowski, David Rosner and the current president Toby Huff.  To date, the Society has held 46 meetings, most of them in the United States but also in Salzburg, Austria; Santo Domingo, The Dominican Republic; Dublin, Ireland; Chiba, Japan; Frenchman’s Cove, Jamaica; St. Petersburg, Russia; Paris, France; New Brunswick, Canada; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  More than 30 countries are represented in the Society’s membership.  Its intellectual dynamism and vibrancy over the years have been maintained and enhanced through its annual meetings, its publications, and the participation of such scholars as Talcott Parsons, Hayden White, Immanuel Wallerstein, Gordon Hewes, André Gunder Frank, Marshall Sahlins, Lynn White Jr., and Jeremy Sabloff.  The Society is committed to the idea that complex civilizational problems can best be approached through multidisciplinary analyses and debate by scholars from a variety of fields.  The Comparative Civilizations Review, which welcomes submissions from the Society’s members as well as other scholars, has been published continually since its inaugural issue in 1979.

==Activities==
The ISCSC is a multidisciplinary scholarly organization that has connections with comparative studies programs throughout the world. The society holds an annual conference, often with the cooperation of other scholarly organizations based in the conference locale. One example of this is the 1998 conference held at [[Reitaku University]] in Japan together with the Japan Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations; the two organizations continue to have a close relationship.

The ISCSC publishes the bi-annual ''''Comparative Civilizations Review'''', a peer-reviewed journal. The blog Civilitas: https://civilitasblog.blogspot.com/ has been active since 2011.

An '''interval signal''', or '''tuning signal''', is a characteristic sound or musical phrase used in [[international broadcasting]], [[numbers stations]], and by some domestic broadcasters, played before commencement or during breaks in transmission, but most commonly between programmes in different languages. It serves several purposes:
* It assists a listener to tune his or her radio to the correct frequency of the station. This is because most older and cheaper radio receivers do not have digital frequency readout.
* It informs other stations that the frequency is in use.
* It serves as a station identifier even if the language used in the subsequent broadcast is not one the listener understands.

The practice began in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s and was carried over into [[shortwave]] broadcasts.  The use of interval signals has declined with the advent of digital tuning systems, but has not vanished. Interval signals were not required on commercial channels in the USA, where jingles were used as identification.

'''Jeremy Lent''' (born 1960) is an author whose writings investigate the patterns of thought that have led civilization to its current crisis of sustainability. He is the founder of the non-profit Liology Institute, which is dedicated to a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. He is the author of ''The Patterning Instinct'' and ''Requiem of the Human Soul''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Earlier in his career, Lent was the founder, chairman and CEO of the internet company [[NextCard]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=899887|title=NEXTCARD INC (Form: S-1/A, Received: 04/30/1999 09:49:46)|website=www.nasdaq.com|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Lent was born and raised in [[London]]. He graduated from the [[University College School]] and earned an undergraduate degree in [[English literature|English Literature]] at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeremylent.com/|title=Website of Jeremy Lent – Author of The Patterning Instinct|website=Jeremy Lent  Author and Integrator|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lent left the UK to live in the United States. In 1986, he earned an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is married and currently lives in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

In addition to his writing, Lent is a practitioner of meditation, [[Qigong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]. He is a Level II certified teacher of Radiant Heart Qigong.

== Career ==
Lent joined Strategic Planning Associates, a strategy consulting company based in Washington, D.C. In 1989, he joined First Deposit Corporation (later renamed [[Providian]]), a direct mail [[credit card]] company in San Francisco. Lent was named [[Chief financial officer|Chief Financial Officer]] of Providian in 1991 and left the company in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1996, Lent founded [[NextCard]], an internet [[financial services]] company. NextCard was the first company to enable consumers to apply for a credit card over the internet and be approved in real time and the first company to offer consumers the ability to design their own card by uploading a personalized image during the application process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As chairman and CEO, Lent took NextCard public in 1999 and led a secondary offering in 2000. However, due to his first wife’s illness, Lent stepped down as CEO later in 2000, to care for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/1012883/1/nextcard-mixes-good-news-quicker-profitability-with-bad-ceos-departure.html|title=NextCard Mixes Good News, Quicker Profitability, With Bad, CEO's Departure|last=Eavis|first=Peter|date=2000-07-24|work=TheStreet|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Lent’s departure, NextCard suffered serious setbacks. It was announced in late 2001, that the company was undercapitalized, and it was taken over by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) in 2002.  Along with the other board members, Lent was involved for several years in shareholder lawsuits and investigations by the FDIC and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). These were eventually settled, and in 2005 the SEC dismissed fraud charges that it had levied against Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19903.htm|title=Jeremy R.

== Writing ==

=== ''The Patterning Instinct'' ===
''The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity’s Search for Meaning'' ([[Prometheus Books]], May 2017) is a cognitive history of humanity, tracing how different cultures patterned meaning into the universe and how that has affected history. The result of ten years of research, the book offers a thesis that “culture shapes values and those values shape history.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This approach is in contrast to the predominant [[Geographic determinism|geographic determinist]] approach to history, exemplified by historians such as [[Jared Diamond]], [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]] and [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]. Lent argues that “The cognitive frames through which different cultures perceive reality have had a profound effect on their historical direction. The worldview of a given civilization—the implicit beliefs and values that create a pattern of meaning in people’s lives—has, in my opinion, been a significant driver of the historical path each civilization has taken.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|date=|title=Patterning Instinct|url=|journal=Origins: The Bulletin of the International Big History Association|volume=VI|pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book conducts what Lent calls an “archaeological exploration of the mind,” using findings from [[cognitive science]] and [[systems theory]] to reveal the implicit layers of values that form cultural norms. In a departure from the mainstream science-religion debate, ''The Patterning Instinct'' shows how medieval Christian rationalism acted as an incubator for scientific thought, which in turn, shaped the modern vision of the “conquest of nature.” Evaluating the sustainability crisis, Lent argues that it is culturally driven: a product of particular patterns that could be reshaped.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com/ProductDetailPage.aspx?sequence=18&amp;group=catalog&amp;mailingID=0&amp;mailingGroupID=0&amp;catalogID=4016922&amp;org=&amp;sku=1633882934|title=The Patterning Instinct|website=edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book concludes by exploring scenarios for humanity’s future, foreseeing a coming struggle between two contrasting views: one driving to a technological world of artificially enhanced humans, the other enabling a sustainable future arising from intrinsic connectedness among people and to the natural world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''The Patterning Instinct'' contains a foreword by [[Fritjof Capra]]. Prior to publication, the book received favorable endorsements from notables such as [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich,]] [[Thom Hartmann]], Rick Hanson, [[J. R. McNeill]], and [[Jonathon Porritt]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guardian journalist, George Monbiot, has called it "the most profound and far-reaching book I have ever read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2018/01/31/stepping-back-from-the-brink/|title=Stepping Back from the Brink|work=George Monbiot|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received a Silver Award from [http://nautilusbookawards.com/2017-silver-winners/ Nautilus Book Awards] in April, 2018 in the Social Sciences &amp; Education category.

=== ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' ===
Beginning around 2005, Lent began an inquiry into the various constructions of meaning formed by cultures around the world and throughout history. The first expression of this investigation was his science fiction novel, ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' (Libros Libertad, 2009)..

The novel is set in the late 22nd century when most people are genetically enhanced. The minority that remains genetically unadulterated, known as Primals, consists mostly of the impoverished global underclass. The UN is holding a hearing in New York to consider whether to make the Primals extinct. The novel is written from the viewpoint of a Primal, Eusebio, who has been picked to represent his race in a last-ditch legal effort to save the Primals from extinction.

The novel raises questions about spirituality, history and global politics: Can the human race enhance itself to a higher plane? At what cost and benefit? If some “essence” of humanity was lost as a result, would that be so bad, given our sordid and shameful history? On the other hand, is there something special—a human soul—worth keeping at any price? Ultimately, the novel invites the reader to grapple with a fundamental question: what does it mean to be human?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Requiem of the Human Soul|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|publisher=Libros Libertad|year=2009|isbn=|location=Vancouver|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liology Institute ==
Lent founded the nonprofit Liology Institute in 2012, with the aim of fostering a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. The institute, according to its website, “is dedicated to fostering a worldview in which the human discovery and experience of meaning in our lives is compatible with the findings of scientific investigation, offering a deeply integrated and coherent understanding of humanity’s place in our cosmos which could enable us to thrive on our planet harmoniously and sustainably.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liology.org/|title=The Liology Institute|website=The Liology Institute|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent coined the term "liology" from the Chinese word ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]],'' meaning organizing principles of the universe, and “ology” of Greek etymology meaning “the study of.” The institute is intended to integrate traditional East Asian practices with the findings of modern systems science.

Its stated objectives are to:
* Stimulate and encourage a deep integration of scientific rigor with spiritual meaning.
* Distill East Asian spiritual traditions and integrate them with findings in systems biology, complexity science and neuroscience.
* Replace the mind/body duality of conventional Western thought with a concept that value is intrinsic to our experience.
* Join the worldwide movement towards achieving a sustainable way of living.
* Adopt an interdisciplinary approach to understanding humanity's history, current condition and trajectory.
* Cultivate skills that promote integration within a person and harmonization between humanity and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
In 2014, the institute began an annual series of workshops, exploring how the values and insights of Liology apply to people’s everyday lives.

== Great Transformation ==
Lent asserts that humanity is entering a period of transformation, of a scale that has occurred twice before in history: the [[First agricultural revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] twelve thousand years ago, and the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s several hundred years ago. The trajectories he consider include a [[collapse of civilization]], a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] techno society and sustainable human flourishing (a "Great Transformation").

Lent claims that, to secure the latter humanity needs a new suite of values based on a sense of intrinsic connectedness. These values emphasize:
* Quality of life, rather than material possessions
* Political, social, and economic choices based on shared humanity
* Environmentally sustainable societies.&lt;ref&gt;“The Great Transformation, Or How We (Just) Avoided a Climate Catastrophe: A historian in 2050 looks back at the first half of the century.” Presented at the UC Santa Barbara virtual conference: ''The World In 2050: Creating/Imagining Just Climate Futures.'' October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language &lt;i&gt;localisation&lt;/i&gt;''' (or '''&lt;i&gt;localization&lt;/i&gt;''', see [[American and British English spelling differences#iseize|spelling-differences]]) is the process of adapting a product that has been previously translated into multiple languages to a specific country or region (from [[Latin]] ''locus'' (place) and the English term ''[[locale (computer software)|locale]]'', "a place where something happens or is set").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2005|title=locale|encyclopedia=The New Oxford American Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second phase of a larger process of product translation and cultural adaptation (for specific countries, regions, or groups) to account for differences in distinct markets, a process known as [[internationalization and localization|internationalisation and localisation]].


Language localisation differs from [[Translation|translation activity]] because it involves a comprehensive study of the target culture in order to correctly adapt the product to local needs. Localisation can be referred to by the [[numeronym]] '''L10N''' (as in: "L", followed by ten more letters, and then "N").

The localisation process is most generally related to the cultural adaptation and translation of [[software]], [[video games]], and [[website]]s, as well as audio/[[voiceover]], [[video]], or other [[multimedia]] content, and less frequently to any written translation (which may also involve cultural adaptation processes). Localisation can be done for regions or countries where people speak different languages or where the same language is spoken. For instance, different [[German dialects|dialects of German]], with [[Idiom|different idioms]], are spoken in [[Standard German|Germany]], [[Austrian German|Austria]], [[Swiss German|Switzerland]], and [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Belgium]].

== The overall process: internationalisation, globalisation and localisation ==
The former [[Localization Industry Standards Association]] (LISA) said that globalisation "can best be thought of as a cycle rather than a single process".&lt;ref name="lisa-whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisa.org/What-Is-Globalization.48.0.html |title=What is Globalization? |work=LISA |publisher=Localization Industry Standards Association |accessdate=6 September 2010 |location=Romainmôtier, Switzerland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101205931/http://www.lisa.org/What-Is-Globalization.48.0.html |archivedate=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''globalise'' is to plan the design and development methods for a product in advance, keeping in mind a multicultural audience, in order to avoid increased costs and quality problems, save time, and smooth the localising effort for each region or country. Localisation is an integral part of the overall process called '''globalisation'''.
[[File:Globalisationchart.jpg|thumb|400px|The globalisation process &lt;br/&gt;(based on a chart from the LISA website.)&lt;ref name="lisa-whatis"/&gt;]]
There are two primary technical processes that comprise globalisation: internationalisation and localisation.

The first phase, '''internationalisation''', encompasses the planning and preparation stages for a product that is built by design to support global markets. This process removes all cultural assumptions, and any country- or language-specific content is stored so that it can be easily adapted. If this content is not separated during this phase, it must be fixed during localisation, adding time and expense to the project. In extreme cases, products that were not internationalised may not be localisable.

The second phase, '''localisation''', refers to the actual adaptation of the product for a specific market. The localisation phase involves, among other things, the four issues LISA describes as ''linguistic'', ''physical'', ''business and cultural'', and ''technical'' issues.

At the end of each phase, testing (including [[quality assurance]]) is performed to ensure that the product works properly and meets the client's quality expectations.

=== Translation versus localisation ===

Though it is sometimes difficult to draw the limits between translation and localisation, in general localisation addresses significant, non-textual components of products or services. In addition to translation (and, therefore, [[grammar]] and [[spelling|spelling issues]] that vary from place to place where the same language is spoken), the localisation process might include adapting graphics; adopting local currencies; using proper format for date and time, addresses, and phone numbers applicable to the location; the choices of colours; cultural references; and many other details, including rethinking the physical structure of a product. All these changes aim to recognise local sensitivities, avoid conflict with local culture, customs, common habits, and enter the local market by merging into its needs and desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blog.ititranslates.com/the-importance-of-website-localization-in-a-global-marketplace-part-2|title=The Importance Of Website Localization In A Global Marketplace|last=Pagano|first=Annie|date=June 2018|journal=Interpreter and Translators, Inc.|publisher=Interpreters and Translators, Inc.|location=Glastonbury,Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, localisation aims to offer country-specific websites of the same company or different editions of a book depending on where it is published. It must be kept in mind that a political entity such as a country is not the same as a language or culture; even in countries where there exists a substantially identical relationship between a language and a political entity, there are almost certainly multiple cultures and multiple minority languages even if the minority languages are spoken by transient populations. For instance, [[Japan]]'s national language is [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and is the primary language for [[Japan#Languages|over 99% of the population]], but the country also recognises [[Languages of Japan|11 languages officially, others are spoken by transient populations, and others are spoken as second or other languages]].

=== Globalisation versus localisation ===

Whereas localisation is the process of adapting one product to a particular locale, globalisation designs the product to minimise the extra work required for each localisation.

Suppose that a company operating exclusively in [[Germany]] chooses to open a major office in [[Russia]] and needs a [[Standard Russian|Russian-language]] website. The company offers the same products and services in both countries with minor differences, but perhaps some elements that appeared in the original website intended for a German audience are offensive or upsetting in Russia (use of flags, colours, nationalistic images, songs, etc.). Thus, that company might lose a potential market because of small details of presentation.

Furthermore, this company might need to adapt the product to its new buyers; video games are the best example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.multilingual.com/articleDetail.php?id=1485|title=Practical skills for video game translators|last=Chandler|first=Heather Maxwell|date=October–November 2008|journal=MultiLingual|publisher=MultiLingual Computing|location=Sandpoint, Idaho}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.multilingual.com/articleDetail.php?id=1486 |title=Preserving the spell in games localization|journal=MultiLingual|date=October–November 2008|last=Crosignani|first=Simone|last2=Ballista|first2=Andrea|last3=Minazzi|first3=Fabio|publisher=MultiLingual Computing|location=Sandpoint, Idaho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, suppose instead that this company has major offices in a dozen countries and needs a specifically designed website in each of these countries. Before deciding how to localise the website and the products offered in any given country, a professional in the area might advise the company to create an overall strategy: to globalise the way the organisation does business. The company might want to design a framework to codify and support this global strategy. The globalisation strategy and the globalisation framework would provide uniform guidance for the twelve separate localisation efforts.

Globalisation is especially important in mitigating extra work involved in the long-term cycle of localisation. Because localisation is a cycle and not a one-time project, there will always be new texts, updates, and projects to localise. For example, as the original website is updated over time, each of the localised websites already translated will also need to be updated. This cycle of work is continuous as long as the original project continues to evolve. It is therefore important for globalisation processes to be created and streamlined in order to implement ongoing changes. 

[[Translation memory]] (TM) technology that exists in various [[translation software]] platforms can aid in this specific aspect of the globalisation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Way to Translate a Website for Accuracy &amp; SEO|url=https://www.pairaphrase.com/best-way-translate-website-accuracy-seo/|website=Pairaphrase|publisher=Pairaphrase Blog|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language tags and codes ==

[[Language codes]] are closely related to the localising process because they indicate the locales involved in the translation and adaptation of the product. They are used in various contexts; for example, they might be informally used in a document published by the European Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370200.htm|title=7.2.1. Order of language versions and ISO codes (multilingual texts)|work=Interinstitutional style guide|publisher=Europa Publications Office|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they might be introduced in [[HTML element]] under the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; attribute. In the case of the European Union style guide, the language codes are based on the [[ISO 639-1]] alpha-2 code; in HTML, the [[IETF language tag|language tags]] are generally defined within the Internet Engineering Task Force's ''[[Best Current Practice]]'' [https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47 (BCP) 47].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''BCP'' is a persistent name for a series of IETF [[Request for Comments]] (RFCs) whose numbers change as they are updated. As of 2015-05-28, the latest included RFC about the principles of language tags is RFC 5646, ''Tags for the Identification of Languages''.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to use one type of code or tag versus another depends upon the nature of the project and any requirements set out for the localisation specialist.

Most frequently, there is a primary sub-code that identifies the language (e.g., "en"), and an optional sub-code in capital letters that specifies the national variety (e.g., "GB" or "US" according to [[ISO 3166-2]]). The sub-codes are typically linked with a hyphen, though in some contexts it's necessary to substitute this with an underscore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libc/localedata/SUPPORTED?rev=1.102&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&amp;cvsroot=glibc|title=libc/localedata/SUPPORTED - view - 1.102|work=sources.redhat.com|publisher=Red Hat|date=18 February 2007|author=drepper|accessdate=6 September 2010}} (List of supported locales in the GNU &lt;tt&gt;libc&lt;/tt&gt; library.)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple language tag systems available for language codification. For example, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) specifies both two- and three-letter codes to represent languages in standards [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 639-2]], respectively.

The "[[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]]" (FVEY) refers to an alliance comprising [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. These countries are bound by the multilateral [[UKUSA Agreement]] for joint cooperation in [[signals intelligence]], [[Defense (military)#Military intelligence|military intelligence]], and [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection)|human intelligence]]. In recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [[Constitutional law|domestic regulations]] on spying.{{refn|&lt;ref name="fiveeyes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=James|title=Canada and the Five Eyes Intelligence Community|url=http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|publisher=[[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]]|date=December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205220700/http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Eyes |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |publisher=[[United States Army Combined Arms Center]] |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MicvdCtb?url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKI Interoperability with FVEY Partner Nations on the NIPRNet |url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |publisher=United States Department of the Navy |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Micdat2m?url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Ball|title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=20 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120033754/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data |archivedate=20 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ewen|last=MacAskill|title=Revealed: Australian spy agency offered to share data about ordinary citizens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118092435/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens|archivedate=18 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|title=NSA 'offers intelligence to British counterparts to skirt UK law'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=10 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229105310/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett|archivedate=29 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/uk-usa-security-britain-idUKBRE95K10620130621 British spy agency taps cables, shares with U.S. NSA – Guardian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125021330/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/uk-usa-security-britain-idUKBRE95K10620130621 |date=2014-01-25 }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', 21 June 2013.

As the surveillance capabilities of the FVEY continue to increase to keep up to pace with technological advancements, a [[global surveillance]] system has been gradually developed to capture the communications of entire populations across national borders.&lt;ref name="gellman12wapo"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Barton Gellman]]|title=Edward Snowden, after months of NSA revelations, says his mission’s accomplished|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html|date=24 December 2013|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=25 December 2013|quote=Taken together, the revelations have brought to light a global surveillance system that cast off many of its historical restraints after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

In order for a person to be included in the list, there must be well-documented evidence based on reliable sources, such as [[leak]]ed or [[Declassification|declassified]] FVEY documents or [[whistleblower]] accounts, which demonstrate that the person involved is, or was, intentionally targeted for surveillance.

| A [[comedian]], filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the [[silent film|silent era]], Charlie Chaplin became one of the most important figures in the film industry through his screen persona "[[the Tramp]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">A '''mutual recognition agreement''' ('''MRA''') is an international agreement by which two or more countries agree to recognize one another's [[conformity assessment]]s.
A '''mutual recognition arrangement''' is an international arrangement based on such an agreement.

MRAs have become increasingly common since the formation of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1995.  They have been forged within and among various [[trade bloc]]s, including [[APEC]] and the [[European Union]].

MRAs are most commonly applied to goods, such as various [[quality control]] MRAs.  However, the term is sometimes applied to agreements on the recognition of professional qualifications as well.

Accreditation Bodies, under the [[International Accreditation Forum]] use the term ''Multilateral Recognition Agreements'' in a similar sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MLA Purpose |url=https://www.iaf.nu/articles/Purpose/15 |website=IAF |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38147">The '''Official Women's Squash World Ranking''' is the official world ranking for women's [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. The ranking is to rate the performance level of female professional squash player. It is also a merit-based method used for determining entry and seeding in women's squash tournaments. The rankings are produced monthly.&lt;ref name="rank&amp;divisor"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://psaworldtour.com/squash/guides/20161005113420_PSATourRuleBook20162017.pdf |title=PSA Tour Rule Book |publisher=PSA |page=41 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current world number one is [[Nour El Sherbini]] of Egypt, who replaced [[Laura Massaro]] in May 2016.

==PSA Ranking Policy==
Players competing in PSA tournaments earn ranking points according to how far they get in the draw. The points available depend on the prize money and the draw size. The monthly rankings (issued on the 1st of the month) are used in selecting entries to tournaments and in determining the seeds.

The total number of points a player earns in a year (52 weeks) is divided by the number of tournaments played (a minimum of eight are required) to give a ranking average. Where a player has played more than 8 tournaments the best scores may be selected (i.e., the lowest are not included).

For example, a player who has competed in 13 events will have selected her best 10 scores, which will be accumulated and divided by 10.

Players competing in [[Professional Squash Association|PSA World Tour]] Events earn ranking points according to the prize money, classification of the event, and the final position in the draw the player reaches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6413">'''Participatory poverty assessment''' (PPA) is the approach to analyzing and reducing poverty by incorporating the views of the poor. PPAs attempt to better understand the poor, to give the poor more influence over decisions that affect their lives, and to increase effectiveness of poverty reduction policies.&lt;ref name="ppa_guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/238411/ppa.pdf |title=A rough guide to PPAs |author=Andy Norton with Bella Bird Karen Brock Margaret Kakande Carrie Turk |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hakikazi.org/tcdd/newpage7.htm |title=Presentation on Introduction to Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs) |publisher=Hakikazi Catalyst |accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPAs are seen as complements to traditional household surveys by helping to interpret survey results, and aim to capture the experiences of the poor by being more open-ended.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiii,xv}}

==History==

Before the 1990s, household-survey approaches were the main way to measure poverty. This shifted to participatory activities in the 1990s after critiques of these traditional methods.&lt;ref name="mcgee"&gt;McGee, Rosemary, ed. ''Knowing Poverty''. London, GB: Routledge, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 11 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,3}}

The term "participatory poverty assessment" was coined within the [[World Bank]] in 1992,&lt;ref name=ppa_guide/&gt; and was seen as a participatory form of poverty assessments (PAs, i.e. survey-based approaches).&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|2,3}}

Early experiences of PPAs were in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|3}}

By 1998, 43 PPAs had been conducted: 28 in Africa, 6 in Latin America, 5 in Eastern Europe, and 4 in Asia.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiii,xiv,15}}

Early PPAs focused most on making higher quality information available to policy makers, rather than seeing the poor as itself being involved in the process of reducing poverty.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Later in the 1990s, "second generation" PPAs appeared, which tried to allow the poor to influence policy decisions.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|4}}

As of 2012, the [[World Bank]]'s [[Voices of the Poor]] is the largest PPA ever to have been conducted.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|4}}

==Rationale and comparison to previous methods==

Both PPAs and traditional surveys contain both quantitative and qualitative information, as well as "subjective" and "objective" parts, so this is not necessarily a distinguishing feature of PPAs.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|4}} Rather:

{{quote |text=Traditional survey data can be used to count, compare, and predict.  The strength of the PPA is not in counting but rather in understanding hidden dimensions of poverty and analyzing causality and processes by which people fall into and get out of poverty.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}}}

PPAs are also distinguished from anthropological studies because the latter analyze few communities in depth, whereas PPAs analyze various communities of a country. PPAs also focus on policy decisions (which anthropological studies don't need to).&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5,6}}

==Types of methodologies and activities==

Within PPAs, various methodologies exist. Some PPAs use more than one methodology.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|6}}

* Field work and conducting interviews&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Rapid rural appraisal
* [[Participatory rural appraisal]] (includes use of visuals, such as matrices and diagramming)
* SARAR (self-esteem, associative strength, resourcefulness, action planning, and responsibility)
* Beneficiary assessment
* Semistructured interviews and focus groups

PPAs can last from several weeks to several months.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|7}}

==Organizations using this approach==

Various organizations have used PPAs as part of their work.

* [[World Bank]]
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|3}}
* [[Department for International Development]]&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|17}}
* [[ActionAid]]
* [[Asian Development Bank]]
* [[Danish International Development Agency]]
* [[Oxfam UK]]
* [[Thailand Development Research Institute]]

In addition, "secondary stakeholders" (i.e. organizations that do not conduct PPAs directly, but participate in PPAs) such as [[UNICEF]], various NGOs (e.g. [[Save the Children]] and [[Oxfam]]), academic institutions, etc., have also participated in PPAs.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Results==

Participatory poverty assessments confirmed the multidimensional nature of poverty (i.e. that the poor deal not just with lack of money, but with various problems like lack of resources, poor health, physical violence, social isolation, etc.) that was seen from traditional household questionnaire-based methods.&lt;ref name="robb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/07/22/000094946_99040105542482/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf |title=Can the Poor Influence Policy? Participatory Poverty Assessments in the Developing World |author=Caroline M. Robb |year=1999 |publisher=[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} PPAs have also been able to access information that was not obtained in household surveys by building trust. For instance PPAs have obtained information on sensitive topics such as [[child prostitution]], drug use, and [[domestic violence]] in relation to poverty.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiv}}

In [[Zambia]], PPAs discovered that the timing of school fees caused economic stress for households, so new legislation to change this timing was proposed.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xv}}

In [[Niger]], a PPA found that the poor see education only as a seventh priority for poverty reduction due to "the concern that what children learn had little relevance to getting people out of poverty". As a result of this PPA, food security was prioritized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/09/21/000160016_20060921172552/Rendered/PDF/373930PAPER0NE0participatory0poverty.pdf |title=Participatory Poverty Assessment - Niger}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vii}}

PPAs have also informed World Bank's [[World Development Report]]s.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|vi}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''Political globalization''' refers to the growth of the worldwide [[political system]], both in size and complexity. That system includes [[Government|national government]]s, their [[governmental organizations|governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organizations]] as well as government-independent elements of [[global civil society]] such as [[international non-governmental organizations]] and [[social movement organization]]s. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the [[nation-state]] and the rise of other actors on the political scene. The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.

Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William R. Thompson]] has defined it as "the expansion of a global political system, and its institutions, in which inter-regional transactions (including, but certainly not limited to trade) are managed".&lt;ref name="ModelskiDevezas2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Modelski|author2=Tessaleno Devezas|author3=William R.

Moghadam defined it as "an increasing trend toward [[multilateralism]] (in which the [[United Nations]] plays a key role), toward an emerging 'transnational state apparatus,' and toward the emergence of national and [[international nongovernmental organizations]] that act as watchdogs over governments and have increased their activities and influence".&lt;ref name="Moghadam2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valentine M. Moghadam|title=Globalizing Women: Transnational Feminist Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuIt1k8wCp8C&amp;pg=PA35|date=20 January 2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8024-7|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manfred B. Steger]] in turn wrote that it "refers to the intensification and expansion of political interrelations across the globe".&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA56|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer definition by [[Colin Crouch]] goes as follows: "Political globalization refers to the growing power of institutions of [[global governance]] such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). But it also refers to the spread and influence of [[international non-governmental organization]]s, [[social movement organization]]s and transnational advocacy networks operating across borders and constituting a kind of [[global civil society]]."&lt;ref name="AmentaNash2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Crouch|chapter=Democracy and Capitalism in the Wake of the Financial Crisis|editor1=Edwin Amenta|editor2=Kate Nash|editor3=Alan Scott|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8gk5-a5CUC&amp;pg=PT487|date=2 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5507-9|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Gerard Delanty]] and [[Chris Rumford]] define it as "a tension between three processes which interact to produce the complex field of [[global politics]]: global [[geopolitics]], global [[normative culture]] and [[polycentric networks]]."&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
[[Salvatore Babones]] discussing sources used by scholars for studying political globalizations noted the usefulness of [[Europa World Year Book]] for data on diplomatic relationships between countries, publications of [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] such as ''The Military Balance'' for matters of military, and US government publication ''Patterns of Global Terrorism'' for matters of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political globalization is measured by aggregating and weighting data on the number of embassies and high commissioners in a country, the number of the country's membership in international organization, its participation in the UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed by said country. This measure has been used by [[Axel Dreher]], [[Noel Gaston]], [[Pim Martens]] [[Jeffrey Haynes]] and is available from the [[KOF institute]] at [[ETH Zurich]]&lt;ref name="Haynes2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Haynes|title=Religion and Political Change in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z-DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69699-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welfens2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.J. Welfens|title=Social Security and Economic Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbC9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date=9 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-40880-9|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
[[Dimensions of globalization|Like globalization itself]], political globalization has several dimensions and lends itself to a number of interpretations. It has been discussed in the context of new emancipatory possibilities, as well as in the context of loss of autonomy and fragmentation of the social world.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"/&gt; Political globalization can be seen in changes such as [[democratization]] of the world, creation of the global [[civil society]],&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-426"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moving beyond the centrality of the [[nation-state]], particularly as the sole actor in the field of politics.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt; Some of the questions central to the discussion of the political globalization are related to the future of the nation-state, whether its importance is diminishing and what are the causes for those changes; and understanding the emergence of the concept of [[global governance]].&lt;ref name="Steger2003-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA57|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabelle Mooney|author2=Betsy Evans|title=Globalization: The Key Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCV-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|date=12 March 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-20472-4|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political actions by non-governmental organizations and social movements, concerned about various topics such as [[environmental protection]], is another example.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt;

[[David Held]] has proposed that continuing political globalization may lead to the creation of a [[world government]]-like [[cosmopolitan democracy]], though this vision has also been criticized as too idealistic.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-68"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B.

==Political Globalization and Nation State==
There is a heated debate over Political Globalization and Nation State. The question arises whether or not political globalization signifies the decline of the nation-state. Hyper globalists argue that globalization has engulfed today's world in such a way that state boundaries are beginning to lose significance. However, skeptics disregard this as naiveté, believing that the nation-state remains the supreme actor in international relations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://internationalaffairsbd.com/political-globalization-nation-state/|title=Contemporary Debate on Political Globalization and Nation StateYeg=PA68|author=|first=|last2=|date=2017|publisher=International Affairs, UK|year=|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|location=|page=68|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Population health]], a field which focuses on the improvement of the health outcomes for a group of individuals, has been described as consisting of three components: "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindig|first=David|last2=Stoddart|first2=Greg|date=2016-10-15|title=What Is Population Health?|pmc=1447747|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=3|pages=380–383|issn=0090-0036|pmid=12604476|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies and Interventions define the methods in which [[Health outcomes research|health outcomes]] and patterns of [[health determinant]]s are implemented. Policies which are helpful "improve the conditions under which people live".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Interventions encourage healthy behaviors for individuals or populations through "program elements or strategies designed to produce behavior changes or improve health status".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.mo.gov/data/interventionmica/index_4.html|title=What is an intervention?|website=health.mo.gov|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies and interventions are needed due to the inequalities amongst populations and the inconsistent way care is administered. Policies can include "necessary community and personal social and health services" &lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; as well as taxes on alcohol and soft drinks and implement smoking cessation policies. Interventions can include therapeutic or preventative health care and may also include actions taken by the individual or by someone on behalf of the individual. The application of population health is determined by the policies and interventions which can be implemented within an organization, city, state or country.

== Common methodology ==
Countries, states, provinces and providers across the globe are shifting towards better systems to respond to inconsistent health outcomes, mitigate decreasing margins and replace outdated methods such as [[fee-for-service]] health delivery. Payment model reforms, including the [[Accountable Care Organization]] (ACO), provide roadmaps for healthcare reform and drive many of its constituents towards more effective and innovative means for improving health outcomes. Population health management is a common approach for resolving these challenges but it involves new methods, tools, systems and implementations to correct inefficiencies and improve health outcomes.

Population health tools and computer systems include data exchange, large datasets, and advanced software which are used to supply data scientists and research teams with appropriate information which can then be used by policy makers and change agents. This method helps to set policies around population health as well as intervention strategies which are then used to respond to the needs of a population.

== Policies and Policymakers ==
Policy for population health "sets priorities" &lt;ref name=Milio&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milio|first=N|date=2016-10-10|title=Glossary: healthy public policy*|pmc=1731988|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=55|issue=9|pages=622–623|doi=10.1136/jech.55.9.622|issn=0143-005X|pmid=11511639}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are a "guide to action to change what would otherwise occur".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Policies are based on "social sciences of sociology, economics, demography, public health, anthropology, and epidemiology" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindig|first=David A|date=2016-10-13|title=Understanding Population Health Terminology|pmc=2690307|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=85|issue=1|pages=139–161|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2007.00479.x|issn=0887-378X|pmid=17319809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and determine how outcomes can be accomplished are implemented at various levels. Such guides determine laws, policies, and ordinances and are defined by policymakers. Examples of policies include "smoking bans, excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, seat belt laws, water fluoridation, and restaurant menu labeling".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.improvingpopulationhealth.org/blog/policies-and-programs.html&lt;/ref&gt; They may be applied to a commercial establishment such as a restaurant, business workplace or within a city or state level. Policies should be evidence based and require academic studies or research to support the approach. This will assure that the appropriate measures needed for each demographic are promoted to encourage the necessary intervention practices which can be applied to each population or to the nation as a whole.

Policymakers can be classified as both private and public and are defined as someone who is in a position of authority to implement health policies. A public policy maker could be a government official and a private policymaker could be a business owner or administrator. Policymakers are influenced by, and can also be, change agents. Change agents include "legislators in Washington, an attorney general, regulators at the FDA, an advocacy group or other organizations that clearly have influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

== Political strategy ==
The goal for any political strategies surrounding population health is to "improve chances of success for policy adoption and implementation".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Such strategies include the creation of funds to support initiatives and the construction of strategies which limit conflicts of interest in the implementation of public policy.

=== Tobacco Control ===
A political strategy implemented to limit the sale and exposure to tobacco products and restrict the tobacco company's ability to benefit politically from charitable donations is the creation of the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|World Health Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)]] treaty. The legally binding document is supported by numerous countries, government/nongovernment agencies and provides the necessary power to prevent negative influences on population health policies.

== Interventions ==
Interventions in population health "shift the distribution of health risk by addressing the underlying social, economic and environmental conditions"&lt;ref name=Hawe&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawe|first=Penelope|last2=Potvin|first2=Louise|date=2017-02-01|title=What is population health intervention research?|pmid=19263977|journal=Canadian Journal of Public Health = Revue Canadienne De Santé Publique|volume=100|issue=1|pages=Suppl I8–14|issn=0008-4263}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are implemented through "programs or policies designed and developed in the health sector, but they are more likely to be in sectors elsewhere, such as education, housing or employment".&lt;ref name=Hawe/&gt; They are aimed at reducing such things as [[childhood obesity]], [[cardiovascular disease]], smoking and mental health issues throughout society. The means in which interventions are devised is through extensive research and contributions from medical scientists, researchers, and medical professionals. They are implemented by but are not limited to educators, practicing physicians, business administrators and mental health professionals.

== Approaches and Implementations ==

A typical approach includes assessing the conditions and possible improvements which can be made within the social determinants that have been identified. Each approach is handled at a state or health plan level.

One example was a workplace in China which implemented policies and interventions for their staff to fight depression. By recognizing the importance of mental health, they were able to reduce depression and improve job satisfaction across the company. The company published its research and findings to promote "enterprises taking more responsibility for the provision of mental health services to their employees".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Jing|last2=Buys|first2=Nicholas|last3=Wang|first3=Xinchao|date=2013-05-14|title=Effectiveness of a Workplace-Based Intervention Program to Promote Mental Health among Employees in Privately Owned Enterprises in China|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/pop.2012.0113|journal=Population Health Management|volume=16|issue=6|pages=406–414|doi=10.1089/pop.2012.0113|issn=1942-7891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example was the implementation of a smoking cessation program to the province of Ontario. Studies were performed on weekly visit rates to psychiatric emergency departments before and after the implementation. The result was a "15.5% reduction in patient visits for patients with a primary diagnosis of psychotic disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurdyak|first=Paul|last2=Cairney|first2=John|last3=Sarnocinska-Hart|first3=Anna|last4=Callahan|first4=Russell C.|last5=Strike|first5=Carol|date=2008-11-01|title=The impact of a smoking cessation policy on visits to a psychiatric emergency department|pmid=19087472|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry. Revue Canadienne De Psychiatrie|volume=53|issue=11|pages=779–782|issn=0706-7437|doi=10.1177/070674370805301110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inequalities and Variance of Implementation ==

As is the common understanding of population health, health inequalities, defined as a "generic term used to designate differences, variations, and disparities in the health achievements of individuals and groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pmc = 1732240 | title =A Glossary for Health Inequalities | authors= Kawachi, I, S Subramanian, and N Almeida-Filho | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 56 | pages = 647–652
 | year = 2002 | pmid=12177079 | doi=10.1136/jech.56.9.647}}&lt;/ref&gt; must be considered to correctly implement the most effective policies and interventions. Based on a population and its socioeconomic, geographic, ethnicity and other factors, policies and interventions may vary. Policies implemented for one population may be less effective and more costly than it would be for another similar population. For example, US policies tend to be more costly than European and have less impact. Research has shown that in some instances, "Americans had worse outcomes than their international peers"&lt;ref name=Squires&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Squires|first=David|last2=Anderson|first2=Chloe|title=U.S. Health Care from a Global Perspective|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also had "the lowest life expectancy at birth of the countries studied".&lt;ref name=Squires/&gt;

'''Post-classical history''' (also called the '''Post-Antiquity era''', '''Post-Ancient Era''', or '''Pre-Modern Era''') is a [[periodization]] commonly used by the school of "[[world history]]" instead of [[Middle Ages]] (Medieval), which is roughly synonymous.&lt;ref name="weller-stearns" /&gt; The period runs from about AD 500 to 1450 though there may be regional differences and debates. The era was globally characterized by the expansion of civilizations geographically, the development of three of the great world religions (Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism), and development of networks of trade between civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aasd.k12.wi.us/staff/hermansenjoel/Notes/the%20post%20classical%20era.pdf The Post‐Classical Era] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031011114/http://www.aasd.k12.wi.us/staff/hermansenjoel/Notes/the%20post%20classical%20era.pdf |date=2014-10-31 }} by Joel Hermansen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weller-stearns" /&gt;

In Asia, the [[spread of Islam]] created a [[Caliphate|new empire]] and [[Islamic Golden Age]] with trade between the [[Asia]]n, [[Africa]]n and [[Europe]]an continents, and advances in [[science in the medieval Islamic world]]. [[East Asia]] experienced the full establishment of power of [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]], which established several prosperous dynasties influencing Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. Religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] spread. [[Gunpowder]] was originally developed in China during the post-classical era. The [[Mongol Empire]] connected Europe and Asia creating safe trade and stability between the two regions. In total the [[World population estimates|population of the world]] doubled in the time period from approximately 210 million in AD 500 to 461 million in 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein Goldewijk|first=Kees|last2=Beusen|first2=Arthur|last3=Janssen|first3=Peter|date=2010-03-22|title=Long-term dynamic modeling of global population and built-up area in a spatially explicit way: HYDE 3.1|journal=The Holocene|volume=20|issue=4|pages=565–573|doi=10.1177/0959683609356587|issn=0959-6836|bibcode=2010Holoc..20..565K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population generally grew steadily throughout the period but endured some incidental declines in events including the [[Plague of Justinian]], [[Mongol invasions and conquests|The Mongol Invasions]] and the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref name="Haub1650"&gt;Haub (1995): "The average annual rate of growth was actually lower from 1 A.D. to 1650 than the rate suggested above for the 8000 B.C. to 1 A.D. period. One reason for this abnormally slow growth was the Black Plague. This dreaded scourge was not limited to 14th century Europe. The epidemic may have begun about 542 A.D. in Western Asia, spreading from there. It is believed that half the Byzantine Empire was destroyed in the 6th century, a total of 100 million deaths."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
===Terminology and periodization===
[[File:Leonardo Bruni 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Leonardo Bruni]] was a Renaissance historian who helped develop the concept of the Middle Ages.]]
'Post-classical history' is a [[periodization]] used by historians employing a "[[world history]]" approach to history, specifically the school developed during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns&gt;{{cite book |editor=R. Charles Weller |title=21st-Century Narratives of World History: Global and Multidisciplinary Perspectives |publisher=Palgrave |chapter=Periodization in World History: Challenges and Opportunities |last=Stearns |first=Peter N. |authorlink=Peter N. Stearns |year=2017 |page= |isbn=978-3319620770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of world history, the term is also sometimes used to avoid erroneous pre-conceptions around the terms "Middle Ages", "Medieval" and "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]" (see [[medievalism]]).

The post-classical period corresponds roughly to the period from 500 to 1450 CE.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Beginning and ending dates might vary depending on the region, with the period beginning at the end of the previous classical period: [[End of the Han Dynasty|Han China]] (ending in 220), the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire]] (in 476), the [[Gupta Empire]] (in the 550s), and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (in 651).

The post-classical period is one of the five or six major periods world historians use: (1) early civilization; (2) [[Ancient history|classical societies]]; (3) post-classical; (4) [[early modern]]; (5) [[long nineteenth century]]; and (6) [[Modern history|contemporary or modern era]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; (Sometimes the nineteenth century and modern are combined.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt;) Although ''post-classical'' is synonymous with the [[Middle Ages]] of Western Europe, the term ''post-classical'' is not necessarily a member of the traditional [[Late Middle Ages#Historiography and periodization|tripartite periodisation]] of Western European history into 'classical', 'middle' and 'modern'.

===Approaches===
The historical field of [[world history]], which looks at common themes occurring across multiple cultures and regions, has enjoyed extensive development since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1–14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; However, World History research has tended to focus on [[early modern globalization]] (beginning around 1500) and subsequent developments, and views post-classical history as mainly pertaining to [[Afro-Eurasia]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Historians recognize the difficulties of creating a periodization and identifying common themes that include not only this region but also, for example, the Americas, since they had little contact with Afro-Eurasia before the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Thus recent research has emphasised that 'a global history of the period between 500 and 1500 is still wanting' and that 'historians have only just begun to embark on a global history of the Middle Ages'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many regions of the world, there are well established histories. Although [[Medieval Studies]] in Europe tended in the nineteenth century to focus on creating histories for individual nation-states, much twentieth-century research focused, successfully, on creating an integrated history of medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Graham A. Loud and Martial Staub, 'Some Thoughts on the Making of the Middle Ages', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Geary, 'European Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jinty Nelson, 'Why Reinventing Medieval History is a Good Idea', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamicate world likewise has a rich regional historiography, ranging from the fourteenth-century [[Ibn Khaldun]] to the twentieth-century [[Marshall Hodgson]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Adam J. Silverstein, ''Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 94-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, research into the network of commercial hubs which enabled goods and ideas to move between China in the East and the Atlantic islands in the West—which can be called the [[Archaic globalization|early history of globalisation]]—is fairly advanced; one key historian in this field is [[Janet Abu-Lughod]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84 [81-83].&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding of communication within sub-saharan Africa or the Americas is, by contrast, far more limited.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84 [80-81].&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent history-writing, therefore, has begun to explore how it might be possible meaningfully to write history that spans the Old World, where human activities were fairly interconnected, and establishes its relationship with other worlds, such as the Americas and Oceania. In the assessment of [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]], [[John Darwin (historian)|John Darwin]], [[Margret Frenz]], and [[Chris Wickham]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;Global history may be boundless, but global historians are not. Global history cannot usefully mean the history of everything, everywhere, all the time. [...] Three approaches [...] seem to us to have real promise. One is global history as the pursuit of significant historical problems across time, space, and specialism. This can sometimes be characterized as [[comparative history|‘comparative’ history]]. [...] Another is connectedness, including transnational relationships. [...] The third approach is the study of globalization [...]. Globalization is a term that needs to be rescued from the present, and salvaged for the past.

==Main trends==

The Post-classical era saw several common developments or themes. There was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas; the rise and/or spread of the three major world, or missionary, religions; and a period of rapidly expanding trade and trade networks.

=== Growth of civilization ===
{{Main|Civilization}}[[File:Líneas de Nazca, Nazca, Perú, 2015-07-29, DD 54.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Nazca culture]] which produced the [[Nazca Lines]] were one of South America's Andean Civilizations thriving from the 1st to the 8th century. Photograph by Diego Delso. ]]
First was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas across [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Mesoamerica]], and western [[South America]]. However, as noted by world historian [[Peter N. Stearns]], there were no common global political trends during the post-classical period, rather it was a period of loosely organized states and other developments, but no common political patterns emerged.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; In Asia, China continued its historic [[dynastic cycle]] and became more complex, improving its bureaucracy. The creation of the Islamic Empires established a new power in the Middle East, North Africa, and [[Central Asia]]. Africa created the [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] and [[Mali Empire|Mali]] kingdoms in the West. The fall of Roman civilization not only left a power vacuum for the Mediterranean and Europe, but forced certain areas to build what some historians might call new civilizations entirely.{{sfn|Birken|1992|pages=451–461}} An entirely different political system was applied in Western Europe (i.e. [[feudalism]]), as well as a different society (i.e. [[manorialism]]). But the once East Roman Empire, Byzantium, retained many features of old Rome, as well as Greek and Persian similarities. Kiev Rus' and subsequently Russia began development in Eastern Europe as well. In the isolated Americas, Mesoamerica saw the building of the [[Aztec]] Empire, while the Andean region of South America saw the establishment of the [[Inca Empire]].

=== Spread of universal religions ===
{{Main|History of religion}}
[[File:Siege of Acre.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Acre (1189–91)|Siege of Acre (1191)]], religious wars were common in Post-classical times. One of the largest of such wars were the [[Crusades]]. Picture dated from 1280.|200x200px]]
Religion that envisaged the possibility that all humans could be included in a universal order had emerged already in the first millennium BC, particularly with Buddhism. In the following millennium, Buddhism was joined by two other major, universalising, missionary religions, both developing from [[Judaism]]: Christianity and Islam. By the end of the period, these three religions were between them widespread, and often politically dominant, across the Old World.&lt;ref name="Yuval Noah Harari 2014"&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, ''[[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]]'', trans. by Yuval Noah Harari, John Purcell and Haim Watzman (London: Harvill Secker, 2014), {{ISBN|978-1846558238|978-1846558245}}, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Buddhism]] spread from India into China and flourished there briefly before using it as a hub to spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam;{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=162–167}} a similar effect occurred with Confucian revivalism in the later centuries.&lt;ref name="Yuval Noah Harari 2014"/&gt;
* [[Christianity]] had become the [[State church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, and continued spreading into northern and eastern Europe during the post-classical period at the expense of belief systems that Christians labelled [[Paganism|pagan]].{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=288}} An attempt was even made to incur upon the Middle East during the [[Crusades]]. The split of the [[Catholic Church]] in Western Europe and the [[Orthodox Church]] in Eastern Europe encouraged religious and cultural diversity in Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard |last=Fletcher |title=The Conversion of Europe: From Paganism to Christianity, 371-1386 AD |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Islam]] began between 610 and 632, with a series of revelations to [[Muhammad]]. It helped unify the warring [[Bedouin]] clans of the Arabian peninsula and, through a rapid series of [[Muslim conquests]], became established to the west across [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|North Africa]], the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Iberian Peninsula]], and parts of [[Islam in Africa|West Africa]], and to the east across [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Persia]], [[Islamicisation of Xinjiang|Central Asia]], [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|India]], and [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam J. |last=Silverstein |title=Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0199545728 |pages=9–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade and communication ===
{{Main|Trade route}}
[[File:Rakaposhi View from Babusar Top.jpg|left|thumb| [[Babusar Pass]] in [[Pakistan]], part of the wider [[Silk Road]] network of overland routes. Image provided by Attabik Awan.]]
Finally, communication and trade across [[Afro-Eurasia]] increased rapidly. The [[Silk Road]] continued to spread cultures and ideas through trade and throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. Trade networks were established between West Europe, Byzantium, early Russia, the Islamic Empires, and the [[Far East]]ern civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/modal/a/environment-and-trade-viking-age|title=Environment and Trade: The Viking Age|publisher=Khan Academy|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627005514/https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/modal/a/environment-and-trade-viking-age|archive-date=2018-06-27|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa the earlier introduction of the Camel allowed for a new and eventually large [[Trans-Saharan trade]] which connected Sub-Saharan West Africa to Eurasia. The Islamic Empires adopted many Greek, Roman, and Indian advances and spread them through the Islamic sphere of influence, allowing these developments to reach Europe, North and West Africa, and Central Asia. Islamic sea trade helped connect these areas, including those in the [[Indian Ocean]] and in the [[Mediterranean]], replacing Byzantium in the latter region. The Christian Crusades into the Middle East (as well as Muslim Spain and [[Sicily]]) brought Islamic science, technology, and goods to Western Europe.{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=288}} Western trade into East Asia was pioneered by [[Marco Polo]]. Importantly, China began the sinicization (or Chinese influence) of regions like Japan,{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=162–167}} Korea, and Vietnam through trade and conquest. Finally, the growth of the [[Mongol Empire]] in Central Asia established safe trade such as to allow goods, cultures, ideas, and disease to spread between Asia, Europe, and Africa.

The Americas had their own trade network, however theirs was limited by the lack of draft animals and the wheel. In [[Oceania]] some of the island chains of [[Polynesia]] and [[Micronesia]] also engaged in trade with one another.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Historical climatology|Little Ice Age}}During Post-Classical times, there is evidence that many regions of the world were affected similarly by global climate conditions however, direct effects in temperature and precipitation varied by region. According to [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] changes did not all occur sanctimoniously at once. Generally however studies found that temperatures were relatively warmer, in the eleventh century, but colder by the early seventeenth century. It is uncertain the degree of climate change which occurred in all regions across the world, and whether such changes were all part of a global trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb09climatology/files/2012/03/Pages_2013_NatureGeo.pdf |title=Continental-scale temperature variability during the past two millennia |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=6 |issue=5 |page=339 |date=2013-04-21 |doi=10.1038/NGEO1797|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..339P |last1=Ahmed |first1=Moinuddin |last2=Anchukaitis |first2=Kevin J. |last3=Asrat |first3=Asfawossen |last4=Borgaonkar |first4=Hemant P. |last5=Braida |first5=Martina |last6=Buckley |first6=Brendan M. |last7=Büntgen |first7=Ulf |last8=Chase |first8=Brian M. |last9=Christie |first9=Duncan A. |last10=Cook |first10=Edward R. |last11=Curran |first11=Mark A.J. |last12=Diaz |first12=Henry F. |last13=Esper |first13=Jan |last14=Fan |first14=Ze-Xin |last15=Gaire |first15=Narayan P. |last16=Ge |first16=Quansheng |last17=Gergis |first17=Joëlle |last18=González-Rouco |first18=J.

There are climate periods that could be roughly said to account for large scale climate trends in the Post Classical Period. These include the [[Late Antique Little Ice Age]], the [[Medieval Warm Period]] and the [[Little Ice Age]]. The [[Extreme weather events of 535–536|Extreme Weather Events of 536–537]] were likely initiated by the eruption of the [[Lake Ilopango|Lake llopango caldera]] in [[El Salvador]]. Sulfate emitted into the air initiated global cooling, migrations and crop failures worldwide possibly intensifying an already cooler time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160208112918.htm|title=Old trees reveal Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA) around 1,500 years ago|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that the world's temperature remained colder on average for at least a century afterwards.

The [[Medieval Warm Period|Medieval Warming Period]] from 950–1250 occurred mostly throughout the northern hemisphere causing many areas to have warmer summers, the high temperatures would only be surpassed by the Global Warming of the 20th/21st centuries. It has been hypothesized that the warm of temperatures allowed the Norse to colonize Greenland, due to ice-free waters at the time. Outside of Europe there is evidence of warming conditions, including higher temperatures in China and major North American droughts which adversely effected numerous cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drought.memphis.edu/NADA/TimeSeriesDisplay.aspx|title=Drought Congruence 1000-1300, Central United States|last=|first=|date=2010|website=North American Drought Atlas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1250, glaciers began to expand in Greenland effecting its [[Thermohaline circulation]], cooling the entire North Atlantic. In the 14th century, the growing season in Europe became unreliable, meanwhile in China the cultivation of Oranges were driven southward by colder temperatures. Especially in Europe, the Little Ice Age had large cultural ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eh-resources.org/timeline-middle-ages/|title=Timeline Middle Ages and Early Modern Period – Environmental History Resources|work=Environmental History Resources|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Little Ice Age]] would persist until the industrial revolution, far beyond the time-frame of the Post Classical Period.&lt;ref name="Hendy2002"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hendy | first1 = E.| last2 = Gagan | first2 = M.| last3 = Alibert | first3 = C.| last4 = McCulloch | first4 = M.| last5 = Lough | first5 = J.| last6 = Isdale | first6 = P.| title = Abrupt decrease in tropical Pacific sea surface salinity at end of Little Ice Age| journal = Science| volume = 295| issue = 5559| pages = 1511–1514| year = 2002| pmid = 11859191| doi = 10.1126/science.1067693|bibcode = 2002Sci...295.1511H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes for the little Ice-Age are unclear, possible explanations include [[Solar maximum|sunspots]], [[Earth's orbit|orbital cycles of the Earth]], [[Volcano|volcanic activity]], [[Thermohaline circulation|ocean circulation]], and man made [[population decline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira_research/Pongratz_Caldeira.html|title=Carnegie Department of Global Ecology|website=dge.carnegiescience.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle East ===
{{main|Medieval Middle East}}

The Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Postclassical Era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the [[Caliphate|Arabian Empires]].

In the 5th century, the Middle East was separated by empires and their spheres of influence; the two most prominent were the [[Sasanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Outline of History|last=Wells|first=H.G|publisher=Garden City Publishing Inc|year=1920|isbn=|location=Garden City, NUY|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.

While the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the Turkic-based [[Seljuq Empire]].
After Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.

The dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions.

In 1401, the region was further plagued by the [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turko-Mongol]], [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].

These were ruled by kings or councils of elders who would control their constituents in a variety of ways. Most of these peoples practiced spiritual, animistic religions. Africa was culturally separated between Saharan Africa (which consisted of [[North Africa]] and the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]) and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (everything south of the Sahara). Sub-Saharan Africa was further divided into the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]], which covered everything north of [[Central Africa]], including [[West Africa]]. The area south of the Sudan was primarily occupied by the [[Bantu peoples]] who spoke the [[Bantu language]]. From 1100 onward [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] and the [[Islamic World]] became dependent on Africa for gold.

After 650 approximately urbanization expanded for the first time beyond the ancient kingdoms [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]] and [[Nubia]]. The Precolonial civilizations of African Civilization can be divided into three categories based on religion.

Sub Saharan Africa was part of two large, separate trading networks, the Trans Saharan trade which bridged commerce between West and North Africa.

There has been difficulty applying the word 'medieval' or 'post classical' to the history of South Asia.

In Southern India, the [[Hindu]] Kingdom of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] gained prominence with an overseas empire that controlled parts of modern-day Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya|Indonesia]] as oversees territories and helped spread Hinduism into the historic culture of these places.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Asia'' by B.V.

From 1206 onward a series of [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Turkic Islamic invasions]] based from modern day Afghanistan and Iran conquered massive portions of Northern India, founding the [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultante]] which remained supreme until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history : cultures, states, and societies to 1500|publisher=|others=Berger, Eugene., Israel, George L., Miller, Charlotte., Parkinson, Brian (Brian R.), Reeves, Andrew., Williams, Nadejda.|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=107|oclc=961216293|last1 = Berger|first1 = Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George L.|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Delhi Sultanate introduced Islam to the conquered populations for the first time. Native religions fared differently, [[Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent|Buddhism declined]] in South Asia vanishing in many areas but Hinduism survived and reinforced itself in areas conquered by [[Hindu–Islamic relations|Muslims]]. In the far South the Kingdom of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijanyagar]] was not conquered by any Muslim state in the period.

While Southeast Asia had numerous outside influences [[Greater India|India]] was the greatest source of inspiration for the region.  North Vietnam as an exception was culturally closer to China for centuries due to conquest.

Since rule from the third century BC North Vietnam continued to be subjugated by Chinese states, although they continually resisted periodically. There were three periods of [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|Chinese Domination]] that spanned near 1100 years. Vietnam gained long lasting independence in the 10th century when China was [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|divided]].  Nonetheless even as an independent state a sort of begrudging [[sinicization]] occurred. By the end of the Postclassical Era, Vietnam would be in control of its own [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. South Vietnam was governed by  the ancient Hindu [[Champa|Champa Kingdom]] but was annexed by [[Cham–Annamese War|Vietnamese invaders]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bc30ytJmwzMC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=annam+sacked+their+country+vietnamese+smashed+champa+cham+officials+told+the+chinese#v=onepage&amp;q=annam%20sacked%20their%20country%20vietnamese%20smashed%20champa%20cham%20officials%20told%20the%20chinese&amp;f=false|title=Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur|first=Ben|last=Kiernan|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|location=|page=110|isbn=978-0300144253|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and maritime trade between China and [[South Asia]] created the foundation for Southeast Asia's first major empires; including the [[Khmer Empire]] from Cambodia and [[Srivijaya|Sri Vijaya]] from Indonesia. During the Khmer Empire's height in the 12th century the city of [[Angkor Thom]] was among the largest of the pre-modern world due to its water management. [[Jayavarman II|King Jayavarman II]] constructed over a hundred hospitals throughout his realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indianized states of Southeast Asia|first=George|last=Cœdès|isbn=978-0824803681|location=Honolulu|oclc=961876784|year=1968|publisher=East-West Center Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby rose the [[Pagan Empire]] in modern-day Burma, using elephants as military might.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chronicle of world history.|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|isbn=978-1568526805|location=Old Saybrook, CT|page=211|oclc=298782520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the Buddhist [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] and its tolerance for believers of older polytheistic gods helped  [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] become supreme in the region.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In Indonesia, [[Srivijaya]] from the 7th through 14th century was a [[Thalassocracy]] that focused on maritime city states and trade. Controlling the vital choke points of the [[Sunda Strait|Sunda]] and [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca straits]] it became rich from trade ranging from Japan through Arabia. Gold, Ivory and Ceramics were all major commodities traveling through port cities. The Empire was also responsible for the construction of wonders such as [[Borobudur]]. During this time Indonesian sailors crossed the [[Indian Ocean]]; evidence suggests that they may have colonized [[History of Madagascar|Madagascar]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar Founded By Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/madagascar-women-120320.html |title=Madagascar Founded By Women  |publisher=Discovery.com|date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian culture spread to the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|Philippines]], likely through Indonesian trade resulting in the first documented use of writing in the archipelago and [[Indianized kingdom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History by Richard Bulliet, Pamela Crossley, Daniel Headrick, Steven Hirsch, Lyman Johnson p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time changing economic and political conditions else where and wars weakened the traditional empires of South East Asia. While the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol Invasions]] did not directly annex Southeast Asia the war-time devastation paved way for the rise of new nations. In the 15th century the Khmer Empire was supplanted by the Thai [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] and [[Srivijaya|Sri Vijaya]] was overtaken by the [[Majapahit]] and later the Islamic [[Malacca Sultanate]] by 1450.

The Mongol Empire which existed during the 13th and 14th centuries, was the largest [[List of largest empires#Largest empires by land area and population|continuous land empire]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan. ''The Mongols''. p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; Originating in the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]], the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from [[Central Europe]] to the [[Sea of Japan]], extending northwards into [[Siberia]], eastwards and southwards into the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Indochina]], and the [[Iranian plateau]], and westwards as far as the [[Levant]] and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chronicle of world history.|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|isbn=978-1568526805|location=Old Saybrook, CT|page=234|oclc=298782520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of nomadic tribes in the [[Mongolia]] homeland under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]], who was proclaimed ruler of all Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and then under his descendants, who sent [[Mongol invasions|invasions]] in every direction.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond.

''Culture and Conquest''. p.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]], or one of his other sons such as [[Tolui]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], or [[Jochi]]. After [[Möngke Khan]] died, rival ''[[kurultai]]'' councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers [[Ariq Böke]] and [[Kublai Khan]], who then not only fought each other in the [[Toluid Civil War]], but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Biran |title=Qaidu and the Rise of the Independent Mongol State in Central Asia |publisher=The Curzon Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0700706310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the [[Chagatai khans|Chagatayid]] and [[House of Ögedei|Ögedeid]] families.

The Chinese style stamp was used outside China as the official symbol of the Khans and their messengers|alt=]]The [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260 marked the high-water point of the [[Mongol conquests]] and was the first time a Mongol advance had ever been beaten back in direct combat on the battlefield. Though the Mongols launched many more invasions into the Levant, briefly occupying it and raiding as far as Gaza after a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]] in 1299, they withdrew due to various geopolitical factors.

By the time of Kublai's death in 1294, the Mongol Empire had fractured into four separate khanates or empires, each pursuing its own separate interests and objectives: the [[Golden Horde]] khanate in the northwest; the [[Chagatai Khanate]] in the west; the [[Ilkhanate]] in the southwest; and the [[Yuan dynasty]] based in modern-day [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="China p413"&gt;''The Cambridge History of China: Alien Regimes and Border States''. p.&amp;nbsp;413.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1304, the three western khanates briefly accepted the nominal suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson.

===The Silk Road===
{{main|History of Central Asia|History of Siberia|Silk Road}}[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|left|thumb|Central Asian Buddhist Monks, the Silk Road allowed for the exchange for ideas as well as goods. A Caucasian looking [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teacher possibly [[Sogdia]]n instructs an East-Asian monk. Dated from the 9th century near [[Turpan|Turfan, Xinxiang, China]] |214x214px]]
The Silk Road was a Eurasian trade route that played a large role in global communication and interaction. It stimulated cultural exchange; encouraged the learning of new languages; resulted in the trade of many goods, such as silk, gold, and spices; and also spread religion and disease.{{sfn|Christian|2000|pages=1–21}} It is even claimed by some historians – such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]], [[William Hardy McNeill]], [[Jerry H. Bentley]], and [[Marshall Hodgson]] – that the Afro-Eurasian world was loosely united culturally, and that the Silk Road was fundamental to this unity.{{sfn|Christian|2000|pages=1–21}} This major trade route began with the [[Han dynasty]] of China, connecting it to the Roman Empire and any regions in between or nearby. At this time, Central Asia exported horses, [[wool]], and [[jade]] into China for the latter's silk; the Romans would trade for the Chinese commodity as well, offering wine in return.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=101}} The Silk Road would often decline and rise again in trade from the Iron Age to the Postclassical Era. Following one such decline, it was reopened in Central Asia by [[Han Dynasty]] General [[Ban Chao]] during the 1st century.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=568}}

The Silk Road was also a major factor in spreading religion across Afro-Eurasia. Muslim teachings from Arabia and [[Persia]] reached East Asia. Buddhism spread from India, to China, to Central Asia. One significant development in the spread of Buddhism was the carving of the [[Gandhara]] School in the cities of [[Taxila (ancient)|ancient Taxila]] and the [[Peshwar]], allegedly in the mid 1st century.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=568}}

The route was vulnerable to spreading plague. The [[Plague of Justinian]] originated in East Asia and had a major outbreak in Europe in 542 causing the deaths of a quarter of the Mediterranean's population. Trade between Europe, Africa and Asia along the route was at least partially responsible for spreading the plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/782/justinians-plague-541-542-ce/|title=Justinian's Plague (541–542 CE)|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a popular theory that the Black Death was caused by the Mongol conquests. The claim is that the direct link that it opened between the East and West provided the path for rats and fleas that carried the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780691135892|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no concrete historical evidence to this theory, the plague is considered endemic on the steppe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road: A Very Short Introduction|last=Milward|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199782864|location=Oxford|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were vulnerabilities as well to changing political situations. The rise of Islam changed the Silk Road, because Muslim rulers generally closed the Silk Road to [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] to an extent Europe would be cut off from Asia for centuries. Specifically, the political developments that affected the Silk Road included the emergence of the Turks, the political movements of the Sasanian and Byzantine empires, and the rise of the Arabs, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith|last=Whitfield|first=Susan|last2=Sims-Williams|first2=Ursula|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1932476121|location=Chicago, IL|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Song Tapestry.jpg|thumb|Chinese-Song-era tapestry, Chinese Silk was carried west over large distances and sold for large profits.|alt=Chinese-Song era tapestry|264x264px]]

The Silk Road flourished again in the 13th century during the reign of the Mongol Empire, which through conquest had brought stability in Central Asia comparable to the [[Pax Romana]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=146|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by a Muslim historian that Central Asia was peaceful and safe to transverse &lt;blockquote&gt;"(Central Asia) enjoyed such a peace that a man might have journeyed from the land of sunrise to the land of sunset with a golden platter upon his head without suffering the least violence from anyone."{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=321}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, trade and communication between Europe, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East required little effort. Handicraft production, art, and scholarship prospered, and wealthy merchants enjoyed cosmopolitan cities.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=321}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Silk Road trade played a role in spreading the infamous [[Black Death]]. Originating in China, the [[bubonic plague]] was spread by Mongol warriors catapulting diseased corpses into enemy towns in the [[Crimea]]. The disease, spread by rats, was carried by merchant ships sailing across the Mediterranean that brought the plague back to Sicily, causing an [[epidemic]] in 1347.{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=310}} Nevertheless, after the 15th century, the Silk Road disappeared from regular use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was primarily a result from the growing sea travel pioneered by Europeans, which allowed the trade of goods by sailing around the southern tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The term ''Post Classical Science'' is often used in Academic Circles and in college courses to combine the study of [[European science in the Middle Ages|Medieval European Science]] and [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Medieval Islamic Science]] due to their interactions with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/HIS-SCI-STUDY-GUIDE/0036_postClassicalScience.html|title=Outline – Post-Classical Science – History of Science Study Guide – Dr Robert A.

In the case of the Western World and in Islamic realms much emphasis was placed on preserving the rationalist Greek Tradition of figures such as [[Aristotle]]. In the context of science within Islam there is a debate as to whether Islamic Scientists simply preserved accomplishments from [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] or built upon earlier Greek advances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1945) ''[[A History of Western Philosophy|History of Western Philosophy]]'', book 2, part 2, chapter X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdus Salam]], H.R.

=== Literate Culture and Arts ===

Within Eurasia, there were four major civilization groups that had literate cultures and created literature and arts. These include Europe, The Middle East, South Asia and East
Asia. Southeast Asia could be a possible fifth category but was influenced heavily from both South and East Asia literal cultures. All four cultures in Post-Classical Times used [[poetry]], [[drama]] and [[prose]]. Throughout the period and until the 19th century poetry was the dominant form of literary expression. In the Middle East, South Asia, Europe and China great poetic works often used figurative language. Examples include, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Shakuntala]]'', the [[Arabic]] ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Thousand and one nights]]'', [[Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]] '' and works by the Chinese [[Du Fu]]. In Japan, prose uniquely thrived more than in other geographic areas. The ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'' is considered the world's first realistic novel written in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-overview/world-literature-music/|title=World Literature and Music {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musically, most regions of the world only used [[Melody|melodies]] as opposed to [[harmony]]. Medieval Europe was the lone exception to this rule, developing harmonic music in the 14th/15th century as musical culture transitioned form sacred music (meant for the church) to secular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-overview/western-music-timeline/|title=Western Music Timeline {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Asian and Mid-Eastern music were similar to each other for their use of [[Microtonal music|microtone]]. East-Asian music shared some similarities with European Music for using a [[Pentatonic scale|pentatnotic scale]].

==The Americas==
{{main|Pre-Columbian era}}

The Postclassical Era of the Americas can be considered set at a different time span from that of Afro-Eurasia. As the developments of Mesoamerican and Andean civilization differ greatly from that of the Old World, as well as the speed at which it developed, the Postclassical Era in the traditional sense does not take place until near the end of the Medieval Age in Afro-Eurasia. As such, for the purposes of this article, the [[Classic stage]] of the Americas will be discussed here, which takes place from about 400 to 1400. For the technical Postclassical stage in American development, see [[Post-Classic stage]].

===North America===
As a continent there was little unified trade or communication. Advances in agriculture spread northward from Measoamerica indirectly through trade. Major cultural areas however still developed independently of each other.

==== Norse Contact and the Polar Regions ====
{{Main|Norse colonization of North America}}
[[File:Authentic Viking recreation.jpg|thumb|Authentic reconstruction of Norse site at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. Photo provided by Dylan Kereluk.]]

While there was little regular contact between the Americas and the Old World the [[Vikings|Norse Vikings]] explored and even colonized [[Greenland]] and [[Canada]] as early as 1000. None of these settlements survived past [[Middle Ages|Medieval Times]]. Outside of Scandinavia knowledge of the discovery of the Americas was interpreted as a [[Vinland#Medieval geographers|remote island]] or the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/writtenclues/4125en.html|title=[Vinland in] Chapter 39|first=Adam of|last=Bremen|date=30 November 1977|website=www.canadianmysteries.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117100208/http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/writtenclues/4125en.html|archivedate=17 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse arriving from Greenland settled Greenland from approximately 980 to 1450.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Norse arrived in southern [[Greenland]] prior to the 13th century approach of [[Inuit]] [[Thule people]] in the area. The extent of the interaction between the Norse and Thule is unclear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Greenland was valuable to the Norse due to trade of ivory that came from the tusks of walruses. The [[Little Ice Age]] adversely effected the colonies and they vanished.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of archaeology|last=1956-|first=Cunliffe, Barry W.

The Norse also explored and colonized farther south in [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland Canada]] at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] referred to by the Norse as ''[[Vinland]]''. The colony at most existed for twenty years and resulted in no known transmission of diereses or technology to the [[First Nations]]. To the Norse ''Vinland'' was known for plentiful grape vines to make superior wine. One reason for the colony's failure was constant violence with the native [[Beothuk]] tribe who the Norse referred to as [[Skræling|Skraeling]].

After initial expeditions there is a possibility that the Norse continued to visit modern day Canada. Surviving records from Medieval Iceland indicate some sporadic voyages to a land called ''[[Markland]]''  possibly the coast of [[Labrador|Labrador, Canada]] as late as the 1347 presumably to collect wood for deforested Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seaver |first=Kristen A. |title=The Frozen Echo: Greenland and the Exploration of North America, Ca.

{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Canada#Post-Archaic periods|History of Native Americans in the United States#Major cultures}}[[File:Mississippi Pipe bowl chunkey player EthnM.jpg|left|thumb|Mississippi Pipe bowl chunkey player EthnM|133x133px]]In northern [[North America]], many [[hunter-gatherer]] and [[agricultural]] societies thrived in the diverse region. [[Native American in the United States|Native American tribes]] varied greatly in characteristics; some, including the [[Mississippian culture]] and the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] were complex chiefdoms. Other nations which inhabited the states of the modern northern United States and Canada had less complexity and did not follow technological changes as quickly. Approximately around the year 500 during the [[Woodland period]] , Native Americans began to transition to bows and arrows from spears for hunting and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archaeology.uiowa.edu/american-indian-archery-technology-0|title=American Indian Archery Technology {{!}} The Office of the State Archaeologist|website=archaeology.uiowa.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancement however was uneven. During the 12th century was the widespread adoption of Corn as a staple crop in the [[Eastern United States]]. Corn would continue to be the staple crop of natives in the Eastern United States and Canada until the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian Exchange]].
[[File:Stonework Mesa Verde National Park Colorado USA.JPG|thumb|Stonework Mesa Verde National Park Colorado|133x133px]]

In The Eastern United States rivers were the medium of trade and communication. [[Cahokia]] located in the modern U.S [[State of Illinois]] was among the most significant within the Mississippi Culture. Focused around [[Monks Mound]] archeology indicates the population increased exponentially after 1000 because it manufactured important tools for agriculture and cultural attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=393|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1350 Cahokia was abandoned, environmental factors have been proposed for the  city's decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.wisc.edu/as-the-river-rises-cahokias-emergence-and-decline-linked-to-mississippi-river-flooding/|title=As the river rises: Cahokia's emergence and decline linked to Mississippi River flooding|website=news.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Ancestral Puebloans constructed clusters of buildings in the [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]] site located in the [[New Mexico|State of New Mexico]]. Individual houses may have been occupied by more than 600 residents at any one time. Chaco Canyon was the only pre-Columbian site in the United States to build paved roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carballo|first=David M|title=Trade Routes in the Americas Before Columbus|url=https://www.academia.edu/4998969|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pottery indicates asociety that was becoming more complex, Turkeys for the first time in the continental United States were also domesticated.
Around 1150 the structures of Chaco Canyon were abandoned, likely as a result of severe drought.{{Sfn|Fagan|2005|pp=18–19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=391|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drought.memphis.edu/NADA/MapDisplay.aspx|title=Reconstructed JJA PDSI 1150 AD|last=|first=|date=2010|website=North American Drought Atlas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also other Pueblo complexes in the Southwestern United States. After reaching climaxes native complex societies in the United States declined and did not entirely recover before the arrival of European Explorers.

==== Measoamerica ====

[[File:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|Toltec [[Atlantean figures]] at the Tula site. The [[Toltec|Toltec Civilization]] inspired the later [[Aztecs]]. Photograph provided by the Wikipedia User Luidger|alt=|left]]At the beginning of the global Post Classic Period, the city of [[Teotihuacan]] was at its zenith, housing over 125,000 people, at 450 A.D it was the sixth largest city in the world at the time. The city's residents built the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] the third largest pyramid of the world, oriented to follow astronomical events. Suddenly in the 6th and 7th centuries, the city suddenly declined possibly as a result of severe environmental damage caused by [[extreme weather events of 535–536]]. There is evidence that large parts of the city were burned, possibly in a domestic rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Teotihuacan/|title=Teotihuacan|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's legacy would inspire all future civilizations in the region.

Following Teotihuacan came the Classic Age of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan Civilization]] clustered in dozens of city states on the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and modern day [[Guatemala]]. The most significant of these cities were [[Chichen Itza]] which often fiercely competed with its neighbors to be the dominant economic influence in the region. The Mayans had an upper caste of priests, who were well versed in astronomy, mathematics and writing. The Mayan developed the concept of zero, and a 365-day calendar which possibly per-dates its creation in Old-World societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab58|title=HISTORY OF MESOAMERICAN CIVILIZATION|website=www.historyworld.net|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 900, many Mayan cities suddenly declined in a period of drought.[[File:Aztec11 Bloodletting.jpg|thumb|Aztec Bloodletting, priests conduct a heart sacrifice, from the ''Tudela Codex'', 16th century.|197x197px]]

The [[Toltec Empire]] arose the from the [[Toltec]] culture, and were remembered as wise and benevolent leaders. One priest-king called [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin]] advocated against human sacrifice. After his death in 947, civil wars of religious character broke out between those who supported and opposed Topiltzin's teachings. Modern historians however are skeptical of the extent of Toltec and influence and believe that much of the information known about the Toltecs was created by the later Aztecs as an inspiration myth.

In the 1300s, a small band of violent, religious radicals called the [[Aztec]]s began minor raids throughout the area.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=148|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually they began to claim connections with the Toltec civilization, and insisted they were the rightful successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://glencoe.mheducation.com/sites/dl/free/0024122010/899891/Bentley5e_Chapter_20_Intro_Final.pdf|title=Traditions and Encounters, AP Edition , 5th Edition|last=Bentley|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=|location=|chapter=Chapter 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began to grow in numbers and conquer large areas of land. Fundamental to their conquest, was the use of [[Terrorism|political terror]] in the sense that the Aztec leaders and priests would command the [[human sacrifice]] of their [[Conquest (military)#Subjugation|subjugated]] people as means of humility and coercion.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Most of the Mesoamerican region would eventually fall under the Aztec Empire.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; On the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] most of the [[Maya peoples|Mayan People]] continued to be independent of the Aztecs but their traditional civilization declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=149|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aztec developments expanded cultivation, applying the use of [[chinampa]]s, irrigation, and [[terrace agriculture]]; important crops included [[maize]], [[sweet potato]]es, and [[avocado]]s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 1430 the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] allied with other powerful [[Nahuan languages|Nahuatl]] speaking cities- [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] and [[Tlacopan]] to create the Aztec Empire otherwise known as Triple-Alliance. Though referred to as an empire the Aztec Empire functioned as a system of tribute collection with Tenochtitlan at its center.  By the turn of the 16h century "[[flower war]]s" between the Aztecs and rival states such as [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] had continued for over fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html |title=Conquistadors – Cortés |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
{{main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}

South American civilization was concentrated in the Andean region which had already hosted complex cultures since 2,500&amp;nbsp;BC.  East of the Andean region, the natives were generally semi nomadic. Discoveries on the [[Amazon basin|Amazon River Basin]] indicate the region likely had a pre-contact population of five million people and hosted complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |date=December 2009 |volume=83 |issue=322 |pages=1084–1095 |title=Pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in the upper Purús: a complex society in western Amazonia |first1=Martti |last1=Pärssinen |first2=Denise |last2=Schaan |first3=Alceu |last3=Ranzi |doi= 10.1017/s0003598x00099373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the continent numerous agricultural peoples from [[History of Colombia|Colombia]] to [[History of Argentina|Argentina]] steadily advanced until European contact.

==== Andean Region ====
{{main|Andean civilizations|}}
[[File:Temple of the Sun, Machu Picchu, Peru - panoramio (1).jpg|left|thumb|Temple of the Sun, Machu Picchu, Peru, provided by David Broad.|238x238px|alt=]]

During [[Ancient history|Ancient times]] the Andean Region had developed civilizations independent of outside influences including that of [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Gary and von Hagen, Adriana (2015), ''Encyclopedia of the Incas'', New York: Rowand &amp; Littlefield, p. 2. Some scholars cite  6 or 7 pristine civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Post Classical era a cycle of civilizations continued until Spanish Contact. Collectively Andean societies lacked currency, a written language and solid draft animals enjoyed by old world civilizations. Instead Andeans developed other methods to foster their growth, including use of the [[quipu]] system to communicate messages, lamas to carry smaller loads and an economy based on [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Societies were often based on strict social hierarchies and economic redistribution from the ruling class.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the first half of the Post Classical Period the Andean Region was dominated by two almost equally powerful states. In the North of Peru was the [[Wari Empire]] and in the South of Peru and Bolivia was there is the [[Tiwanaku empire]] both of whom were inspired by the earlier [[Moche culture|Moche People]]. While the extent of their relationship to each other known, it is believed that they were in a Cold-War with one another, competing but avoiding direct conflict to avoid [[mutual assured destruction]]. Without war there was prosperity and around the year 700 Tiwanaku city hosted a population of 1.4.&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Alan L. ''Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara,'' Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 8th century both states declined due to changing environmental conditions, laying the ground work for the Incas to emerge as a distinct culture centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=387|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century the [[Inca Empire]] rose to annex all other nations in the area. Led by their, sun-god king, [[Sapa Inca]], they slowly conquered what is now [[Peru]], and built their society throughout the Andes cultural region. The Incas spoke the [[Quechua languages]] The Incas used the advances created by earlier Andean societies .Incas have been known to have used [[abacus]]es to calculate mathematics. The Inca Empire is known for some of its magnificent structures, such as [[Machu Picchu]] in the [[Cusco region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=389|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The empire expanded quickly northwards to Ecuador, Southwards to central Chile. To the north of the Inca Empire remained the independent [[Tairona]] and [[Muisca Confederation|Musica Confederation]] who practiced agriculture and gold metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Muisca_Civilization/|title=Muisca Civilization|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Tairona_Civilization/|title=Tairona Civilization|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1200&amp;nbsp;AD the [[Tu'i Tonga Empire]] spread its influence far and wide throughout the South Pacific Islands, being described by academics as a maritime chiefdom which used trade networks to keep power centralized around the king's capital.

As the postclassical era drew to a close in the 15th century, many of the empires established throughout the period were in decline. The [[Byzantine Empire]] would soon be overshadowed in the Mediterranean by Italian city states such as [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and the [[Ottoman Turks]]. The Byzantines faced repeated attacks from eastern and western powers during the [[Fourth Crusade]], and declined further until the loss of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|pages=138–139|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest change came in terms of trade and technology. The global significance of the fall of the Byzantines was the disruption of overland routes between Asia and Europe. Traditional dominance of [[Nomad]]ism in Eurasia declined and the [[Pax Mongolica|Pax Mongolia]] which had allowed for interactions between different civilizations was no longer available. China, which had previously engaged in expansion and innovation became isolationist in the 14th century under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and would remain so until the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|pages=168–169|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Asia]] and [[South Asia]] were conquered by [[Gunpowder Empires]] which successfully utilized advances in military technology but closed the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Madeline C.|last=Zilfi|year=1997|title=Halil Inalcik and Donald Quataert, editors.

Europeans – specifically the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and various Italian explorers – intended to replace land travel with sea travel. Originally European exploration merely looked for new routes to reach known destinations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Post-classical history#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese Explorer [[Vasco da Gama|Vasco De Gama]] traveled to India by sea in 1498 by circumnavigating Africa around the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Northrup|first=David|date=1998|title=Vasco da Gama and Africa: An Era of Mutual Discovery, 1497-1800|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/179280|journal=Journal of World History|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=189–211|doi=10.1353/jwh.2005.0107|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt; India and the coast of Africa were already known to Europeans but none had attempted a large trading mission prior to that time. Due to navigation advances Portugal would create a [[Portuguese Empire|global colonial empire]] beginning with the conquest of [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in modern-day [[Malaysia]] from 1511.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Harper Collins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=158|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Explorers such as the Spanish sponsored Italian [[Christopher Columbus]] intended to engage in trade by traveling on unfamiliar routes west from Europe. The subsequent [[European discovery of the Americas]] in 1492 resulted in the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian exchange]] and the world's first [[globalization]]. Spanish Explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] performed the first known [[Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|circumnavigation]] of Earth in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of goods and diseases across [[ocean]]s was unprecedented in creating a more connected world. From developments in navigation and trade [[modern history]] began.

The '''Revolutions of 1917–1923''' were a period of political unrest and revolts around the world inspired by the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the disorder created by the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The uprisings were mainly [[socialist]] or [[anti-colonial]] in nature and were mostly short-lived, failing to have a long-term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/david-motadel/waves-revolution |title=Waves of Revolution |last1=Motadel |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=April 4, 2011 |website=History Today |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the revolutionary activity of the era, the [[revolutionary wave]] of 1917–1923 mainly refers to the unrest caused by [[World War I]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnLI8ooHHPgC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=1917%E2%80%9323+wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tb3I4H5ZA&amp;sig=j8d0sgDCa3o0D0fK8fPGymAhdlM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW0Mr-q8TMAhULKh4KHfsFDlAQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1917%E2%80%9323%20wave&amp;f=false |title=Neutral Europe Between War and Revolution, 1917-23 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Hans |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist revolutions in Europe==
===Russia===
{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] but before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]], and [[Peace of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]]]

In war-torn [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], the liberal [[February Revolution]] toppled the monarchy. It was unstable and the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. The ascendant [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] soon withdrew from the war with some territorial concessions by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].  It then battled its political rivals in the [[Russian Civil War]], including [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invading forces from the Allied Powers]]. In response to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the Bolshevik Party and the emerging [[Soviet Union]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] from a broad assortment of ideological factions fought against them, particularly through the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[White movement]] and the peasant [[Green armies|Green Army]], the various nationalist movements in [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]] and other would-be new states like those in Soviet [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Soviet Central Asia]], through the [[Anarchism|anarchist]]-inspired [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|Third Russian Revolution]] and [[Tambov Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Ascher, //The Russian Revolution: A Beginner's Guide'' (Oneworld Publications, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, due to exhaustion, the collapse of transportation and markets, and threats of starvation, even dissident elements of the [[Red Army]] itself were in revolt against the [[communist state]], as shown by the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. However, the multiple anti-Bolshevik forces were uncoordinated and disorganized, and in every case operated on the periphery. The Red Army, operating at the center, defeated them one by one and regained control. The complete failure of Comintern-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from world revolution to the theme of socialism in one country, Russia. Lenin moved to open trade relations with Britain, Germany, and other major countries. Most dramatically, in 1921, Lenin introduced a sort of small-scale capitalism with his [[New Economic Policy]] (or NEP). In this process of revolution and counter-revolution the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) was officially born in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Wade, "The Revolution at One Hundred: Issues and Trends in the English Language Historiography of the Russian Revolution of 1917." ''Journal of Modern Russian History and Historiography'' 9.1 (2016): 9-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
{{Main|German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Biennio Rosso}}
[[File:Berlin.revolution1918.statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of a revolutionary soldier; memorial to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] in [[Berlin]]]]

The [[Leninist]] victories also inspired a surge by the [[History of communism|world Communist movement]]: the larger [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] and its offspring, like the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], as well as the neighboring [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Hungarian Revolution]], and the [[Biennio Rosso]] in Italy in addition to various smaller uprisings, protests and strikes, all proved abortive.

The Bolsheviks sought to coordinate this new wave of revolution in the Soviet-led [[Communist International]], while new [[Communist party|communist parties]] separated from their former socialist organizations and the older, more moderate [[Second International]]. Despite ambitions for [[world revolution]], the far-flung Comintern movement had more setbacks than successes through the next generation, and it was abolished in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (Macmillan, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War when the [[Red Army]] occupied most of Eastern Europe, Communists would come to power in the Baltic states, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: A History of World Communism'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Communist revolutions==
===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 anticipated the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) within the same historical period as this first wave of [[communist revolution]]. The [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] movement of the time was predominantly nationalist and [[Populism|populist]], and although it had left-wing positions and included socialists and communists, it was not Communist. The Irish and Soviet Russian Republics nevertheless found common ground in their opposition to [[British Empire|British interests]], and established a trading relationship.

===Mexico===
The same was true of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), which had broken out in 1910 but had devolved into factional fighting among the rebels by 1915, as the more radical forces of [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] lost ground to the more conservative "Sonoran oligarchy" and its [[Constitutional Army]]. The [[Felicistas]], the last major group of counterrevolutionaries, abandoned their armed campaign in 1920, and the internecine power struggles abated for a time after revolutionary General [[Álvaro Obregón]] had bribed or slain his former allies and rivals alike, but the following decade witnessed the assassination of Obregon and several others, abortive [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempts and a massive right-wing uprising, the [[Cristero War]], due to religious persecution of Roman Catholics.

The [[Sette Giugno|Sette Giugno of 1919]] was a revolt characterised by a series of riots and protests by the Maltese population, initially as a reaction to the rise in the cost of living in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and the sacking of hundreds of workers from the dockyard. This coincided with popular demands for [[Self-governance|self-government]], which resulted in a National Assembly being formed in Valletta at the same time of the riots. This dramatically boosted the uprising, as many people headed to Valletta to show their support for the Assembly. This led to the British forces firing into the crowd, killing four local men. The cost of living increased dramatically after the war. Imports were limited, and as food became scarce prices rose; this made the fortune of farmers and merchants with surpluses to trade.

===Egypt===
The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] was a countrywide [[revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It was carried out by [[Egyptians]] and Sudanese from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of revolutionary leader [[Saad Zaghloul]], and other members of the [[Wafd Party]] in 1919. The revolution led to Britain's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|recognition of Egyptian independence]] in 1922, and the implementation of a new [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|constitution in 1923]]. Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, [[Sudan]] and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]], requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|used Egypt]] as a major base for its operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.

'''Soft power''' is the ability to attract and [[Co-option|co-opt]], rather than [[coerce]] ([[hard power]]). Soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. A defining feature of soft power is that it is non-coercive; the currency of soft power is culture, political values, and foreign policies. Recently, the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and [[lobbying]] through powerful political and non-political organizations. In 2012, [[Joseph Nye]] of [[Harvard University]] explained that with soft power, "the best [[propaganda]] is not propaganda", further explaining that during the [[Information Age]], "credibility is the scarcest resource."&lt;ref name=WSJmay2012&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nye |first1=Joseph |title=China's Soft Power Deficit To catch up, its politics must unleash the many talents of its civil society |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577389923098678842 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nye coined the term in a 1990 book, ''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''. In this book, he wrote: “when one country gets other countries to want what it wants-might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.”&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"&gt;Nye, Joseph.''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''(New York: Basic Books, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; He further developed the concept in his 2004 book, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''. The term is now widely used in international affairs by analysts and statesmen. For example, [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] spoke of the need to enhance American soft power by "a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of [[national security]] – [[diplomacy]], [[strategic communications]], foreign assistance, civic action and [[economic reconstruction]] and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |author=Robert M.

According to the Soft Power 30, an annual index published by [[Portland Communications]] and the [[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] for 2018, the [[United Kingdom]] is the leading sovereign state in soft power. Other leading countries in soft power include [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Switzerland]], [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClory|first=Jonathan|title=''The Soft Power 30: A Global Ranking of Soft Power, 2017''|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Soft-Power-30-Report-2017-Web-1.pdf|date=18 July 2017|publisher=Portland|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2016/17 [[Monocle (UK magazine)|''Monocle'']] Soft Power Survey, ranks the United States as the leading country in soft power.

== Description ==
[[File:Soft Power (2004) by Joseph Nye.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Nye's 2004 book describing the concept of "soft power"]]

[[Joseph Nye]] introduced the concept of "soft power" in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Power-Means-Success-Politics/dp/1586482254/&lt;/ref&gt; For Nye, power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want. There are several ways one can achieve this: you can coerce them with threats; you can induce them with payments; or you can attract and co-opt them to want what you want. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"/&gt;

It can be contrasted with '[[hard power]]', which is the use of coercion and payment. Soft power can be wielded not just by states but also by all actors in international politics, such as [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nye, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered the "second face of power" that indirectly allows you to obtain the outcomes you want. A country's soft power, according to Nye, rests on three resources: "its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Future_of_Power.html?id=AH08y1Bi1Y0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"A country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries – admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness – want to follow it. In this sense, it is also important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, and not only to force them to change by threatening military force or economic sanctions. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes that you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Soft power resources are the assets that produce attraction which often leads to acquiescence.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"/&gt; Nye asserts that, "Seduction is always more effective than coercion, and many values like democracy, human rights, and individual opportunities are deeply seductive."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelo Codevilla]] observed that an often overlooked essential aspect of soft power is that different parts of populations are attracted or repelled by different things, ideas, images, or prospects.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power is hampered when policies, culture, or values repel others instead of attracting them.

In his book, Nye argues that soft power is a more difficult instrument for governments to wield than hard power for two reasons: many of its critical resources are outside the control of governments, and soft power tends to "work indirectly by shaping the environment for policy, and sometimes takes years to produce the desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008.) pp. 59–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The book identifies three broad categories of soft power: "culture", "political values", and "policies."

In ''The Future of Power'' (2011), Nye reiterates that soft power is a descriptive, rather than a normative, concept.&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, soft power can be wielded for nefarious purposes. "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Josef Stalin|Stalin]], and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] all possessed a great deal of soft power in the eyes of their acolytes, but that did not make it good. It is not necessarily better to twist minds than to twist arms."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81" /&gt; Nye also claims that soft power does not contradict the international relations theory of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. "Soft power is not a form of idealism or liberalism. It is simply a form of power, one way of getting desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations of the concept ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Soft power has been criticized as being ineffective by authors such as [[Niall Ferguson]] in the preface to ''Colossus''. [[Neorealism (international relations)|Neorealist]] and other rationalist and neorationalist authors (with the exception of [[Stephen Walt]]) dismiss soft power out of hand as they assert that actors in international relations respond to only two types of incentives: economic incentives and force.

As a concept, it can be difficult to distinguish between soft power from hard power. For example, Janice Bially Mattern argues that [[George W. Bush]]'s use of the phrase "you are either with us or with the terrorists" was in fact an exercise of hard power. Though military and economic force was not used to pressure other states to join its coalition, a kind of force – representational force – was used. This kind of force threatens the identity of its partners, forcing them to comply or risk being labelled as evil. This being the case, soft power is therefore not so soft.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Bially Mattern, "Why 'Soft Power' Isn't So Soft: Representational Force and the Sociolinguistic Construction of Attraction in World Politics," ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies'' 33, no. 3 (2005): 586.&lt;/ref&gt; However, rationalist authors{{Who|date=May 2013}} would merely see this as an 'implied threat', and that direct economic or military sanctions would likely follow from being 'against us'.

== Measurement ==
The first attempt to measure soft power through a composite index was created and published by the [[Institute for Government]] and the media company ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=McClory|title=The new persuaders: an international ranking of soft power|date=2010-12-07|publisher=Institute for Government|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|work=Institute for Government website|page=13|accessdate=2011-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053803/http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IfG-Monocle Soft Power Index combined a range of statistical metrics and subjective panel scores to measure the soft power resources of 26 countries. The metrics were organized according to a framework of five sub-indices including culture, diplomacy, education, business/innovation, and government. The index is said to measure the soft power resources of countries, and does not translate directly into ability influence. ''Monocle'' has published an annual ''Soft Power Survey'' since then. As of 2016/17, the list is calculated using around 50 factors that indicate the use of soft power, including the number of cultural missions (primarily language schools), [[Olympic medals]], the quality of a country's [[architecture]] and business brands.&lt;ref name="monocle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2016-17/|title=Soft Power Survey 2016/17|date=2016|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Soft Power 30'', which includes a foreword by Joseph Nye, is a ranking of countries' soft power produced and published by the media company ''Portland'' in 2015. The ranking is based on "the quality of a country’s political institutions, the extent of their cultural appeal, the strength of their diplomatic network, the global reputation of their higher education system, the attractiveness of their economic model, and a country’s digital engagement with the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Soft Power 30 - A Global Ranking of Soft Power|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/pdfs/the_soft_power_30.pdf|publisher=Portland|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Softly does it|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21657655-oxbridge-one-direction-and-premier-league-bolster-britains-power-persuade-softly-does-it|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=The Economist|date=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In ‘soft power’ terms, Japan ranks eighth out of 30 countries in U.K. consultancy report|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/15/national/soft-power-terms-japan-ranks-eighth-30-u-k-consultancy-gauge/#.Value4u-ra4|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=Japan Times|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elcano Global Presence Report'' scores the [[European Union]] first for soft presence when its member states are excluded and the EU is considered as a whole.&lt;ref name=ElcanoEU /&gt;

Soft power, then, represents the third behavioral way of getting the outcomes you want. Soft power is contrasted with hard power, which has historically been the predominant realist measure of national power, through [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] such as [[population]] size, concrete [[military]] assets, or a nation's [[gross domestic product]]. But having such resources does not always produce the desired outcomes, as the United States discovered in the Vietnam War. The extent of attraction can be measured by public opinion polls, by elite interviews, and case studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Nye argues that soft power is more than influence, since influence can also rest on the hard power of threats or payments. And soft power is more than just persuasion or the ability to move people by argument, though that is an important part of it. It is also the ability to attract, and attraction often leads to acquiescence.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In [[international relations]], soft power is generated only in part by what the government does through its policies and public diplomacy. The generation of soft power is also affected in positive (and negative) ways by a host of non-state actors within and outside the country. Those actors affect both the general public and governing elites in other countries, and create an enabling or disabling environment for government policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In some cases, soft power enhances the probability of other elites adopting policies that allow one to achieve preferred outcomes. In other cases, where being seen as friendly to another country is seen as a local political kiss of death, the decline or absence of soft power will prevent a government from obtaining particular goals. But even in such instances, the interactions of civil societies and non-state actors may help to further general milieu goals such as democracy, liberty, and development. Soft power is not the possession of any one country or actor.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The success of soft power heavily depends on the actor's [[reputation]] within the [[international community]], as well as the flow of information between actors. Thus, soft power is often associated with the rise of [[globalization]] and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberal international relations theory]]. [[Popular culture]] and [[mass media]] are regularly identified as a source of soft power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|title=Economic warfare on the silver screen|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=2012-01-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the spread of a national language or a particular set of [[norm (sociology)|normative]] structures; a nation with a large amount of soft power and the good will that engenders it inspire others to [[acculturation|acculturate]], avoiding the need for expensive [[hard power]] expenditures.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} More particularly, [[World news|international news]] was found crucial in shaping the image and reputation of foreign countries.

Because soft power has appeared as an alternative to raw power politics, it is often embraced by ethically-minded scholars and policymakers. But soft power is a descriptive rather than a normative concept. Like any form of power, it can be wielded for good or bad purposes. While soft power can be used with bad intentions and wreak horrible consequences, it differs in terms of means. It is on this dimension that one might construct a normative preference for greater use of soft power.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Research ==

Academics have engaged in several debates around soft power. These have included:
* Its usefulness (Giulio Gallarotti, Niall Ferguson, Josef Joffe, Robert Kagan, Ken Waltz, Mearsheimer vs Nye, Katzenstein, Janice Bially Mattern, Jacques Hymans, Alexander Vuving, Jan Mellisen)
* How soft power and hard power interact (Giulio Gallarotti, Joseph Nye)
* Whether soft power can be coercive or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], (Janice BIally Mattern, Katzenstein, Duvall &amp; Barnet vs Nye, Vuving)
* How the relationship between [[structure and agency]] work (Hymans vs Nye)
* Whether soft balancing is occurring (Wohlforth &amp; Brooks vs Walt ''et al''.)
* Soft power and normative power in Europe (Ian Manners, A Ciambra, Thomas Diez, A Hyde Pryce, Richard Whitman)
* How [[civil resistance]] (i.e., non-violent forms of resistance) can often involve certain uses of soft power, but remains a distinct concept (Adam Roberts, Timothy Garton Ash)
* The ways through which states' attempts at soft power can backfire, leading to instances of 'soft disempowerment' (Paul Michael Brannagan and Richard Giulianotti)

One study finds that a state's soft power has a measurable effect on its exports. Countries that are admired for their positive global influence export more, holding other things constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soft power raises exports|url = http://www.voxeu.org/article/soft-power-raises-exports|website = VoxEU.org|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Throughout the world ===
The Soviet Union competed with the U.S. for influence throughout the [[Cold War]]. The Soviets were engaged in a broad campaign to convince the world of the attractiveness of its Communist system. In 1945, the Soviet Union was very effective in attracting many in Europe from its resistance to Hitler, and in colonized areas around the world because of its opposition to European imperialism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004). Ch 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets also employed a substantially large [[public diplomacy]] program that included: promoting their high culture, broadcasting, disseminating disinformation about the West, and sponsoring nuclear protests, peace movements, and youth organizations. Despite all of this, the Soviets' closed system and lack of popular culture impeded the ability of the Soviet Union to compete with the U.S. in terms of soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Soviet soft power in Poland : culture and the making of Stalin's new empire, 1943-1957 |last=Babiracki |first=Patryk |date=2015 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=9781469623085 |location=Chapel Hill |oclc=911173017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Autocracy|non-democratic governments]] have attempted to use [[Human migration|migration]] as an instrument of soft power: [[Egypt]] under the rule of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] trained and dispatched thousands of teachers across the [[Arab world]] in an effort to spread ideas of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialism]] and [[anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsourapas |first=Gerasimos |date= |title=Authoritarian emigration states: Soft power and cross-border mobility in the Middle East |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512118759902 |journal=International Political Science Review |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=400-416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cuba]], the [[Fidel Castro]] regime's [[Cuban medical internationalism|medical internationalism]] programme has dispatched thousands of medical professionals abroad for cultural diplomacy purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cuban medical internationalism : origins, evolution, and goals |last=Kirk |first=John M. |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |last2=Erisman |first2=H.

After [[Pope John Paul II]] visited [[Poland]] in 1979, some political commentators said his visit influenced events against Poland's communist government, the [[Soviet Union]], and ultimately [[communism]], which promoted [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt;

{{quote|"The Pope won that struggle by transcending politics. His was what Joseph Nye calls "soft power" – the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime’s reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. "Be not afraid," he said. Millions shouted in response, "We want God! We want God! We want God!" The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished." &lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Besides the Pope's visit, American-government broadcasting and propaganda into Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly Poland, contributed to the rise of the [[Solidarity]] movement and to the collapse of the Soviet-backed governments there and in the rest of the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance.&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"/&gt;

The United States and Europe have consistently been sources of influence and soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joseph Nye|title=Europe’s Soft Power|url=http://www.theglobalist.com/europes-soft-power/|publisher=The Globalist|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=3 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European culture]]'s art, literature, music, design, fashion, and even food have been global magnets for some time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Europe and the U.S. have often claimed to support [[human rights]] and [[international law]] throughout the world. Unlike the U.S., Europeans' love of football enhances their soft power globally, whereas the primary sports of the U.S. such as American football and baseball are largely unpopular on the world stage. In 2012, the [[European Union]] was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] "for over six decades [it has] contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2012 - European Union (EU)|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu-facts.html|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From war to peace: European Union accepts Nobel Prize|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/10/world/nobel-peace-prize/|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has the largest diplomatic network in the world,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globaldiplomacyindex.lowyinstitute.org/country_rank.html|title=Global Diplomacy Index – Country Rank|last=|first=|date=|website=Lowy Institute|language=|access-date=2018-04-01|ref=Lowy2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest number of foreign journalists based in the country,&lt;ref name="Monocle2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soft Power Survey 2012|url=http://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2012/|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most popular destination for international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study in the USA|url=http://www.internationalstudent.com/study_usa/|publisher=International Student|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cinema of the United States|American films]], among other influences, have contributed to the [[Americanization]] of other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fluck|first1=Prof. Dr. Winfried|title=The Americanization of Modern Culture: A Cultural History of the Popular Media*|url=http://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/en/v/publications_fluck/2000/Romance_with_America/Fluck__Winfried_-_The_Americanization_of_Modern_Culture.pdf|publisher=John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies, Berlin|accessdate=5 December 2015|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia and more recently China have been working to use the potential soft power assets that are present in the admiration of their ancient cultures, arts, fashion and cuisine. China is presenting itself as a defender of national sovereignty,&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which became an issue after the [[NATO]] air campaign to oust Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and NATO's support of the rebels in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;Felgenhauer, Pavel. "The Fall of Gaddafi Angers Many In Moscow". ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'' Volume: 8 Issue: 164. September 8, 2011. http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38374&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese are also competing with the United States to gain influence throughout the South Pacific, however some commentators have said their recent assertiveness in this region has created an appeal for nations in this region to align with the United States thus increasing U.S. soft power in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft power extends beyond the operations of government, to the activities of the private sector and to society and culture at large.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008) p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power has gained more influence because it addresses the underlying dispositions of the people who have increasingly become more active in their governments.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt; This is true even in authoritarian countries where people and institutions are increasingly able to shape the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Science Board, Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Strategic Communication (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[information age]] has also led to the rise of soft power resources for non-state actors, Primarily, through the use of global media, and to a greater extent the internet using tools such as the [[World Wide Web]], non-state actors have been able to increase their soft power and put pressure on governments that can ultimately affect policy outcomes. Instead of front organizations, non-state actors can create cyber advocacy organizations &lt;ref&gt;Steele, Robert D. ''The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, &amp; Political: Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs and Corruption''. Oakton, Virginia: OSS International Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; to recruit members and project their voice on the global stage.

=== China ===
{{Main|Soft power of China}}
China's traditional culture has been a source of attraction, building on which it has created several hundred [[Confucius Institute]]s around the world to teach its language and culture. The enrollment of foreign students in China has increased from 36,000 a decade before to at least 240,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Jr. Why China Is Weak on Soft Power; Jan, 17, 2012 https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/opinion/why-china-is-weak-on-soft-power.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; China's [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] has attracted many western countries to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With New Bank, China Shows U.S. It's Got Soft Power|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/23/with-new-bank-china-shows-u-s-its-got-soft-power/print/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, China had the second largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A spring 2014 Global Attitudes survey from Pew Research Center states China receives mostly positive reviews in the sub-Saharan African nations polled, although South Africans are closely divided (45% favorable, 40% unfavorable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America’s Image|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-2-chinas-image/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China's increasing soft power can be explained by looking at China's economic growth and regarding economic engagement with many African countries. China's expansion of trade and investment on the African continent and the spread of Chinese-led infrastructure projects gives positive impressions of China to people in Africa. China's economic engagement in African countries is considered as much more pragmatic and in consistency with the priorities of many African countries. Moreover, China's increasing role as a global superpower seems appealing and this drives a desire to tie African economies more closely to China's economy.

China has made a systematic effort to expand and give greater profile to its soft-power policies in Africa ever since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000. The commitments of China's soft power ranges from health, humanitarian assistance to academic, professional and cultural exchange. China's assistance to Africa, however, is not near the U.S. assistance in Africa.

Cultural exchange between China and Africa can be a representative example of how China has been spreading its soft power.
In 2005, the first Confucius Institute was established in Africa. The institute is funded by the Chinese government and it provides Chinese language and cultural programming to the public. There are 19 institutes today in Africa and China has planned to spend 20 million renminbi for education projects in South Africa, including the teaching of Mandarin in 50 local high schools.

Furthermore, there is an increasing support for cultural visitors programs which gained momentum in 2004 when the African Cultural Visitors Program was established. There is a rising number of African entrepreneurs who choose to move to China and there are also diaspora communities in many Chinese cities that have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer G. Cooke. China's soft power in Africa; {{cite web |url=http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324122951/http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Africa, Chinese soft power extends to countries like [[Barbados]]. Barbadian Prime Minister [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]] expressed admiration for the Chinese economic model and sought to emulate the way Chinese state controlled banks guided development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/03/09BRIDGETOWN144.html# Wikileaks 09Barbados144]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[France]] has long exerted a great amount of soft power. The country and [[French culture|its culture]] have for centuries been admired in many parts of the world; so much so that [[Thomas Jefferson]] is famously quoted as saying "Every man has two countries, his own and France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|title=Americans in France|publisher=[[U.S. Embassy Paris]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418070413/http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|archivedate=2015-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very term "culture" comes from France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/39149-french-culture.html French Culture: Customs &amp; Traditions], [[LiveScience]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, France had the third largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

France was a focal point of the [[Age of Enlightenment]];&lt;ref&gt;"Enlightenment thought culminates historically in the political upheaval of the French Revolution, in which the traditional hierarchical political and social orders (the French monarchy, the privileges of the French nobility, the political power and authority of the Catholic Church) were violently destroyed and replaced by a political and social order informed by the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and equality for all, founded, ostensibly, upon principles of human reason." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/ Enlightenment], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; its attachment to the ideals of [[liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[reason]] was notably embodied in the writing and publishing of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The [[French Revolution]] was one of the most significant events in European and world history. France has since then been instrumental in spreading [[Republicanism in France|Republican ideals]]. The [[Napoleonic Code]], which influenced much of the rest of Europe and beyond, is regarded as one of the most important law document of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Robert B. Holtman 1981"&gt;Robert B. Holtman, ''The Napoleonic Revolution'' (Baton Rouge: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French language]] has for centuries been an important diplomatic language. For example, French has to be used  &amp;ndash; on par with English &amp;ndash; for all documents issued by the [[United Nations Treaty Series]], ensuring that all UN treaties are equally valid in their English and French versions.&lt;ref&gt;"Treaties registered with the United Nations Treaty Series are always translated into French and English. Documents are always provided in French and English. This city’s Geneva Conventions, written in equally authentic French and English versions, laid part of the groundwork for the international system." [https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy Languages of diplomacy - Towards a fairer distribution], [[The Economist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

France has also followed for decades a very active diplomatic and cultural policy.

France's [[laïcité]], [[secularism]], policy has inspired some countries over time.

=== Germany ===
The annual soft power rankings by ''Monocle'' magazine and the Institute for Government ranks 30 countries which “best attract favor from other nations through culture, sport, cuisine, design, diplomacy and beyond.”
''Monocle'' magazine said: “[[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] may be painted as a stern taskmaster but it seems she has a softer side, or the country she leads does.”
It said Germany’s rise as a soft power should not come as a surprise.
“The country is traditionally excellent at pursuing its ideas, values and aims using diplomatic, cultural and economic tools," it said. “By quietly doing the simple things well it is a country that has become a global power and the rest of us can feel comfortable with that.”
Germans had been understandably wary about depicting a dominant image abroad, the magazine added, but it said that the country’s rise should not make everyone else feel uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Germany tops world 'soft power' rankings; http://www.thelocal.de/20131121/germany-number-one-for-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerhard Schröder: 'Germany Can Only Lead Europe the Way Porcupines Mate'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-former-german-chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-on-foreign-policy-a-891839.html|publisher=Spiegel Online International|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama sets off on farewell trip to Europe in shadow of president-elect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-faces-awkward-task-on-sad-farewell-visit-to-europe|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=Reuters|date=14 November 2016|quote=As the Americans see it, Merkel – and certainly not the vainglorious European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – runs the EU.

=== Italy ===
The famous elements of Italian soft culture are its art, music, fashion, and iconic food. Italy was the birthplace of [[opera]],&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell, David R. B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C37Gq2GagZIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Italian Opera.''] Cambridge University Press, 1994. p. 1. Web. 22 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and for generations the language of opera was [[Italian language|Italian]], irrespective of the nationality of the composer. Popular tastes in drama in Italy have long favored comedy; the improvisational style known as the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' began in Italy in the mid-16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/commedia-dell-arte/ |title=Commedia dell'arte |work=Treccani, il portale del sapere |access-date=24 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still performed today. Before being exported to France, the famous [[Ballet]] dance genre also originated in Italy.
The country boasts several world-famous cities. [[Rome]] was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Florence]] was the heart of the [[Renaissance]], a period of great achievements in [[the arts]] that ended the Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Zirpolo, Lilian H.

Web. 16 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important cities include [[Turin]], which used to be the capital of Italy, and is now one of the world's great centers of automobile engineering. [[Milan]] is a  [[fashion capital]] of the World. [[Venice]], with its intricate canal system, attracts tourists from all over the world especially during the [[Venetian Carnival]] and the [[Biennale]].
Italy is home to the greatest number of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s (51) to date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list |title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date=25 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.sitiunesco.it/beni-italiani.html |title=Beni Italiani Unesco |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716051913/http://www.sitiunesco.it/beni-italiani.html |archive-date=2012-07-16 |work=Associazione Città e Siti Unesco |access-date=17 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to one estimate the country is home to half the world's great art treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbot |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGuWGa48iQMC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Italy |publisher=Morellini Editore |year=2006 |page=101 |access-date=24 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (churches, cathedrals, archaeological sites, houses and statues).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvYobEC-wtEC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Italy |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd |year=2012 |pages=23-24 |access-date=1 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Cool Japan}}
"'''Cool Japan'''" is a concept coined in 2002 as an expression of [[Culture of Japan|Japan’s popular culture]]. The concept has been adopted by the Japanese government as well as trade bodies seeking to exploit the commercial capital of the country’s culture industry.&lt;ref&gt;Japan's Soft Power-Squaring the Cool, June 14, 2014; https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/06/japans-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cool Japan Illustrated, http://www.cool-jp.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a form of soft power, "the ability to indirectly influence behavior or interests through cultural or ideological means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christine R.

In a 2002 article in the journal ''Foreign Policy'' titled “Japan’s Gross National Cool”, Douglas McGray wrote of Japan “reinventing superpower” as its cultural influence expanded internationally despite the economic and political problems of the “lost decade.” Surveying youth culture and the role of J-pop, manga, anime, fashion, film, consumer electronics, architecture, and cuisine, McGray highlighted Japan’s considerable soft power, posing the question of what message the country might project. He also argued that Japan’s recession may even have boosted its national cool, due to the partial discrediting of erstwhile rigid social hierarchies and big-business career paths.&lt;ref name="McGray"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglasmcgray.com/cool-japan.html |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2002/05/01/japans_gross_national_cool |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |url-access=subscription |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"'''Hallyu'''", also known as the "'''Korean Wave'''", is a [[neologism]] referring to the spread of South Korean culture since the late 1990s.

In 2012, the [[BBC]]'s country rating poll revealed that public opinion of [[South Korea]] has been improving every year since the first rating poll for the country was conducted in 2009. In several countries such as [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[France]], public opinion of South Korea turned from slightly negative to generally positive.

First driven by the spread of [[Korean drama]]s televised across [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] during its initial stages, the ''Korean Wave'' evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon due to the proliferation of Korean pop ([[K-pop]]) music videos on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Yoon, Lina.

=== United States ===
The [[United States]] has long had a great deal of soft power. Examples include [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[four freedoms]] in Europe at the end of [[World War II]], young people behind the [[Iron Curtain]] listening to the government's foreign propaganda arm [[Radio Free Europe]], Chinese students symbolizing their protests in [[Tiananmen Square]] by creating a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]] that they called "Goddess of Democracy", newly liberated Afghans in 2001 asking for a copy of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and young Iranians today surreptitiously watching banned American videos and satellite television broadcasts in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X" /&gt; America's early commitment to religious toleration, for example, was a powerful element of its overall appeal to potential immigrants; and American aid in the reconstruction of Europe after World War II was a propaganda victory to show off the prosperity and the generosity of the people of the United States.

Studies of American broadcasting into the [[Soviet bloc]], and testimonials from Czech President [[Václav Havel]], Polish President [[Lech Wałęsa]], and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] support that soft power efforts of the United States and its allies during the Cold War were ultimately successful in creating the favorable conditions that led to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Satellite TV is actively promoting American soft power in the Arab world in ways that the United States has been incapable of doing. The launch of the Arabic-language [[Alhurra]] satellite channel in early 2004 to provide news and entertainment in ways more beneficial to the U.S., marked an important turning point in U.S. public diplomacy development. Though it calls itself the largest Arabic-language news organization in the world, the Virginia-based Alhurra lacks the cachet and brand recognition of Al Jazeera, but its balanced presentation of news has earned it a small but significant viewership. Controversial innovations in radio broadcasting that target young mass audiences through a mix of light news and mild American popular music – [[Radio Sawa]] in [[Arabic]] and [[Radio Farda]] in [[Persian language|Persian]] – have captured a substantial market share in their target regions."&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71" /&gt;

However the artwork was painted onto a Grade II [[listed building]] - [[153-159 Fairview Road]] - and the council prevented it from being removed, giving it retrospective listed building consent in 2015 and affording it some protection from removal.

'''Stand Up To Cancer''' ('''SU2C''') is a charitable program of the [[Entertainment Industry Foundation]] (EIF). SU2C aims to raise significant funds for translational cancer research through online and televised efforts. Central to the program is a telethon that was first televised by four major broadcast networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[FOX]]) in over 170 countries on September 5, 2008. SU2C raised over $100 million after that evening's broadcast.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Keveney |first=Bill |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-09-05-cancer-telethon_N.htm |title=Stars 'Stand Up to Cancer,' raise $100M - USATODAY.com |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds collected by Stand Up To Cancer are then distributed by the [[American Association for Cancer Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gorman, [[Registered nurse|R.N.]]|first1=Ali|title=Telethon helping locals stand up to cancer|url=http://6abc.com/health/telethon-helping-locals-stand-up-to-cancer-/1505279/|accessdate=10 September 2016|agency=[[WPVI-TV]]|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Stand Up To Cancer was conceived of in autumn 2007, by a group of women who had been affected by cancer and believe that by merging the recourse of the media and entertainment industries into a single operation they would be able to fight against this disease in a more profound way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standup2cancer.org/faq |title=Stand Up To Cancer — FAQ |publisher=Standup2cancer.org |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stand Up To Cancer was formally launched on May 27, 2008. Current members of the SU2C Council of Founders and Advisors (CFA) include [[Katie Couric]], [[Sherry Lansing]], Kathleen Lobb, Lisa Paulsen, Rusty Robertson, Sue Schwartz, Pamela Oas Williams, and Ellen Ziffren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standup2cancer.org/su2c_leadership |title=Stand Up To Cancer — SU2C Leadership |publisher=Standup2cancer.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; All current members of the CFA were co-producers of the 2012 televised special. The late co-founder [[Laura Ziskin]] executive produced both the September 5, 2008 and September 10, 2010 broadcasts. Sung Poblete, Ph.D., R.N., has served as SU2C’s president and CEO since 2011. In the United Kingdom, [[Channel 4]], along with [[Cancer Research UK]], launched its own version of ''[[Stand Up to Cancer UK|Stand Up To Cancer]]'' in October 2012, which has continued every year since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://su2c.channel4.com/|title=Stand Up To Cancer|work=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiative ==
Stand Up To Cancer aims to raise awareness and bring about an understanding that everyone is connected by cancer. The statistic used most often by SU2C is from the [[American Cancer Society]]: one out of every two men and one out of every three women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime,&lt;ref name=acscf&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/STT/content/STT_1x_Cancer_Facts_and_Figures_2008.asp?from=fast ACS Cancer Facts and Figures 2008]. Retrieved on 27 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning everyone is affected in some way, or will be.

The campaign has featured televised moments during [[World Series]] baseball games where fans literally "stand up to cancer" by rising and holding signs inscribed with the names of friends and loved ones who have struggled with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB stands up to cancer during Game 4 of Series|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/63396062/|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Research teams funded==
SU2C has donated hundreds of millions of dollars since the first "Dream Team" was organized in 2009. The "Dream Teams" funded by SU2C brings researchers together from institutions and universities across the world and have been among the most productive collaborations in getting new drugs to market and many teams are funded jointly with other cancer research organizations. The research is required to be [[translational]] and include laboratory and clinical members and cannot involve more than one principal investigator from each institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standup2cancer.org/the_su2c_research_model&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacr.org/FUNDING/PAGES/SUTC-LISTING.ASPX#.WFAhS6IrK-o&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these dream teams are co-sponsored by other cancer-related foundations.

==UK==
{{Main|Stand Up to Cancer UK}}

On 19 October 2012, the [[Channel 4]] network in the [[United Kingdom]] aired their first telethon for Stand Up To Cancer hosted by [[Davina McCall]] and [[Alan Carr]] along with Dr. [[Christian Jessen]]. A second telethon was broadcast on 17 October 2014, again hosted by McCall and Carr along with Dr. Jessen. Subsequent UK telethons, again on Channel 4, followed in 2016 and 2018.

Stand Up To Cancer's fundraising activities in the UK include the London 3 Peaks Challenge, which involves participants running up the stairs of [[Heron Tower]], [[30 St Mary Axe]] and [[200 Aldersgate]] before abseiling down the outside of [[200 Aldersgate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2014/09/12/have-you-got-what-it-takes-to-tackle-londons-three-peaks-challenge-aka-running-up-three-skyscrapers/ |title=Have you got what it takes to tackle London’s Three Peaks Challenge (aka running up three skyscrapers)? – Now.

'''Technoscape''' is a term coined by [[Arjun Appadurai]] in order to describe one of the five dimensions of global cultural flows. The five dimensions consist of ethnoscapes, mediascapes, '''technoscapes''', financescapes, and ideoscapes. The suffix -scape denotes that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, linguistic, and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: "[[nation-states]], multinationals, [[Diaspora|diasporic]] communities, as well as subnational groupings and movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Economy|date=1990|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son, Ltd|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be religious, political, or economic. In a more specific scope, Technoscape is the movement of technology (mechanical and informational) and the ability to move such technology at rapid speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lechner|first1=Frank|last2=Boli|first2=John|title=The Globalization Reader|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son, Ltd|location=Malden MA|isbn=978-1-118-73355-4|page=97|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the physical boundaries technology is able to maneuver around.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6360">The "'''too connected to fail'''" ('''TCTF''') concept refers to a [[financial institution]] which is so connected to other institutions that its failure would probably lead to a huge turnover in the whole system.&lt;ref&gt;Haldane, A.G. &amp; May R. M. (2011). Systemic Risk in Banking Ecosystems. ''Nature''. 469(7330): 351–5. {{doi|10.1038/nature09659}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the "[[too big to fail]]" theory, this approach takes into consideration the highly connected network feature of the financial system rather than the absolute size of one particular institution.

== Relevance of TCTF: systemic risk ==

The 2007/2008 [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis]] highlighted that a small turmoil can cause a big fallback in the financial system – mainly because financial institutions form a highly interconnected network. From a [[network science]] point of view this means that some nodes (institutions) have very high degree, i.e. they are linked to many other nodes. As a consequence, they play a central role in the system, which can be highly important in the case of disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Chan-Lau, J. A. (2010). Balance Sheet Network Analysis of Too-Connected-to-Fail Risk in Global and Domestic Banking Systems. ''IMF Working Paper''. WP/10/107. April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of this effect led to the revival of [[macroprudential regulation]].

== Measuring TCTF ==

Determining which institute is TCTF is not as straightforward as in the case of the "[[too big to fail]]" theory. In this case one doesn't have easily measurable metrics like assets’ value or the volume of financial services. However, there are some approaches trying to establish a clear method in order to identify the key institutions in the network.

=== Eigenvector Centrality ===

Nacaskul&lt;ref&gt;Nacaskul, P. (2010) Systemic Import Analysis (SIA) – Application of Entropic Eigenvector Centrality (EEC) Criterion for a Priori Ranking of Financial Institutions in Terms of Regulatory-Supervisory Concern, with Demonstrations on Stylised Small Network Topologies and Connectivity Weights, 14 May 2010, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Asian Research Financial Stability Network Workshop, 29 March 2012, Bank Negara Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. {{ssrn|1618693}}. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1618693}}.&lt;/ref&gt; posits that a financial institution is systemically important if it is highly connected (e.g. via [[interbank lending market]]/[[money market]] channel) to systemically important banks. Those, in turn, are systemically important if they are highly connnected to systemically important banks, and so on. The recursive definition is equivalent to performing [[eigendecomposition of a matrix]] of connectivity weights and assigning systemic importance in proportion to the values of the principal eigenvector. The "entropic" factor correction is introduced therein to correct for the possibility that performing eigendecomposition on weighted connectivity matrices may occasionally yield "degenerate" systemic importance scores (all financial institutions identical in terms of systemic importance). Nacaskul &amp; Sabborriboon&lt;ref&gt;Nacaskul, P. &amp; Sabborriboon, W. (2011) Systemic Risk – Identification, Assessment and Monitoring based on Eigenvector Centrality Analysis of Thai Interbank Connectivity Matrices, 27 December 2011. {{ssrn|2710476}}. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.2710476}}.&lt;/ref&gt; then extends the Systemic Importance Analysis (SIA) above, which focuses on systemic leverage each individual financial institution exerts on the overall system, to Systemic Vulnerability Analysis (SVA), whereby the overall system is assessed as to how vulnerable it is to disproportionate systemic leverages exerted by individual financial institutions, and applied the methodology to Thai interbank money-market funding matrix.

=== Node degree ===

If one defines the links connecting the different nodes in the network, then the TCTF feature of a certain node can be examined using [[network science]] methodology. The most simple way of thinking about the role of an institution is the number of connections it has, which is called the degree of the node. Depending on the type of the network one can define in and out-degree. Knowing the key players one can test the risk involved in the network by simulating targeted attacks (shocks).

One example for this method is the paper of León et al.,&lt;ref&gt;León, C., Machado, C., Cepeda, F. &amp; Sarmiento, M. (2011) Too-Connected-To-Fail Institutions and Payments System's Stability: Assessing Challenges for Financial Authorities. ''Borradores de Economia''. No. 644, 2011. {{ssrn|2101221}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which analyzed the systemic risk within Colombia’s financial market. They defined an institution's in-degree as its share in total traded value, and the out-degree as its share of total number of connections based on transactions in the paying system. Using these metrics they constructed an index of [[centrality]] that let them identify the key institutions in the system, and made it possible to test the network's resistance to shocks.

=== DebtRank (feedback centrality) ===

Another way to measure the TCTF feature of an institution is based on the concept of feedback [[centrality]]. One example for this is the DebtRank introduced in the paper of Battiston et al.&lt;ref&gt;Battiston, S., Puliga, M., Kaushik, R., Tasca, P. &amp; Caldarelli, G. (2012). [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00541 DebtRank: Too Central to Fail? Financial Networks, the FED and Systemic Risk]. ''Scientific Reports'' 2. 541. 2 August 2012. {{doi|10.1038/srep00541}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors defined financial institutions as nodes and directed edges as lending relations weighted by the amount of outstanding debt. Then, they computed the DebtRank for every node, which measures that in the case of the distress of the particular node what fraction of the total economic value is potentially affected. By doing this they identified the key financial institutions in the US between 2008 and 2010.

'''World-systems theory''' (also known as '''world-systems analysis''' or '''the world-systems perspective''')&lt;ref name=IW&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein, (2004), "World-systems Analysis." In ''World System History'', ed. George Modelski, in ''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems'' (EOLSS), Developed under the Auspices of the UNESCO, Eolss Publishers, Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt; is a multidisciplinary, macro-scale approach to [[world history]] and [[social change]] which emphasizes the [[world-system]] (and not [[nation state]]s) as the primary (but not exclusive) unit of [[social analysis]].&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

"World-system" refers to the inter-regional and transnational [[division of labor]], which divides the world into [[core countries]], [[semi-periphery countries]], and the [[periphery countries]].&lt;ref name=TB&gt;Thomas Barfield, ''The dictionary of anthropology'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1997, {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Print, p.498-499]&lt;/ref&gt; Core countries focus on higher skill, [[Capital (economics)|capital]]-intensive production, and the rest of the world focuses on low-skill, labor-intensive production and extraction of [[raw material]]s.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; This constantly reinforces the dominance of the core countries.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; Nonetheless, the system has dynamic characteristics, in part as a result of revolutions in [[transport]] technology, and individual states can gain or lose their core (semi-periphery, periphery) status over time.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; This structure is unified by the division of labour. It is a world-economy rooted in a capitalist economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World-systems analysis: An introduction|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel Maurice|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=23–24|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, certain countries become the world [[hegemon]]; during the last few centuries, as the world-system has extended geographically and intensified economically, this status has passed from the [[Netherlands]], to the [[United Kingdom]] and (most recently) to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;

==Background==

[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] has developed the best-known version of world-systems analysis, beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1974). The Modern World-System I: Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PH&gt;Paul Halsall [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/wallerstein.html Modern History Sourcebook: Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory], August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Wallerstein traces the rise of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] world-economy from the "long" 16th century (c. 1450–1640). The rise of capitalism, in his view, was an accidental outcome of the protracted crisis of feudalism (c. 1290–1450).&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1992). "The West, Capitalism, and the Modern World-System", Review 15 (4), 561-619; also Wallerstein, The Modern World-System I, chapter one; Moore, Jason W. (2003) "[http://www.jasonwmoore.com/uploads/Moore__The_Modern_World-System_as_Environmental_History__Theory___Society__2003_.pdf The Modern World-System as Environmental History?] Ecology and the rise of Capitalism," Theory &amp; Society 32(3), 307–377.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe ([[Western world|the West]]) used its advantages and gained control over most of the world economy and presided over the development and spread of [[industrialization]] and capitalist economy, indirectly resulting in [[international inequality|unequal development]].&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

Though other commentators refer to Wallerstein's project as world-systems "theory", he consistently rejects that term.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 2004. ''The Uncertainties of Knowledge''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallerstein, world-systems analysis is a mode of analysis that aims to transcend the structures of knowledge inherited from the 19th century, especially the definition of capitalism, the divisions within the social sciences, and those between the social sciences and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory|last=So|first=Alvin Y.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1990|isbn=|location=Newbury Park, London and New Delhi|pages=169–199|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallerstein, then, world-systems analysis is a "knowledge movement"&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 2004. 2004a. "World-Systems Analysis." In ''World System History: Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems'', edited by George Modelski. Oxford: UNESCO/EOLSS Publishers, http://www.eolss.net.&lt;/ref&gt; that seeks to discern the "totality of what has been paraded under the labels of the... human sciences and indeed well beyond".&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, ''The Uncertainties of Knowledge'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; "We must invent a new language," Wallerstein insists, to transcend the illusions of the "three supposedly distinctive arenas" of society, economy and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1991. "Beyond Annales," ''Radical History Review'', no. 49, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The trinitarian structure of knowledge is grounded in another, even grander, modernist architecture, the distinction of biophysical worlds (including those within bodies) from social ones: "One question, therefore, is whether we will be able to justify something called social science in the twenty-first century as a separate sphere of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1995. "What Are We Bounding, and Whom, When We Bound Social Research?" ''Social Research'' 62(4):839–856.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jason W. 2011. 2011.

==Origins==

===Influences and major thinkers===
World-systems theory traces emerged in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Its roots can be found in [[sociology]], but it has developed into a highly interdisciplinary field.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
World-systems theory was aiming to replace [[modernization theory]], which Wallerstein criticised for three reasons:&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
# its focus on the [[nation state]] as the only [[unit of analysis]]
# its assumption that there is only [[sociocultural evolution|a single path of evolutionary development for all countries]]
# its disregard of transnational structures that constrain local and national development.

There are three major predecessors of world-systems theory: the Annales school, the Marxist tradition, and the dependence theory.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAMV&gt;Carlos A. Martínez-Vela, [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/WorldSystem.pdf World Systems Theory], paper prepared for the [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/NewNotebook.htm Research Seminar in Engineering Systems], November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The '''[[Annales School]]''' tradition (represented most notably by [[Fernand Braudel]]) influenced Wallerstein to focusing on [[longue durée|long-term processes]] and geo-ecological regions as [[unit of analysis]]. '''[[Marxism]]''' added a stress on [[social conflict]], a focus on the [[capital accumulation]] process and competitive [[class struggle]]s, a focus on a relevant totality, the transitory nature of social forms and a [[dialectic]]al sense of motion through conflict and contradiction.

World-systems theory was also significantly influenced by '''[[dependency theory]]''', a [[neo-Marxist]] explanation of development processes.

Other influences on the world-systems theory come from scholars such as [[Karl Polanyi]], [[Nikolai Kondratiev]]&lt;ref&gt;Kondratieff Waves in the World System Perspective. ''[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=336&amp;Itemid=1 Kondratieff Waves. Dimensions and Perspectives at the Dawn of the 21st Century]'' / Ed. by Leonid E. Grinin, Tessaleno C. Devezas, and Andrey V. Korotayev. Volgograd: Uchitel, 2012. P. 23–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (particularly their research on [[business cycles]] and the concepts of three basic modes of economic organization: reciprocal, redistributive, and market modes, which Wallerstein reframed into a discussion of mini systems, world empires, and world economies).

Wallerstein sees the development of the capitalist world economy as detrimental to a large proportion of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1983). Historical Capitalism. London: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallerstein views the period since the 1970s as an "age of transition" that will give way to a future world system (or world systems) whose configuration cannot be determined in advance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hopkins|Hopkins, Terence K.]], and Immanuel Wallerstein, coordinators (1996). ''The Age of Transition''. London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

World-systems thinkers include [[Samir Amin]], [[Giovanni Arrighi]], [[Andre Gunder Frank]], and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], with major contributions by [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], [[Beverly Silver]], [[Volker Bornschier]], [[Janet Abu Lughod]], [[Thomas D. Hall]], [[Kunibert Raffer]], [[Theotonio dos Santos]], Dale Tomich, Jason W. Moore and others.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; In sociology, a primary alternative perspective is [[World Polity Theory]], as formulated by [[John W. Meyer]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Dependency theory===
{{Main article|Dependency theory}}
World-systems analysis builds upon but also differs fundamentally from [[dependency theory]]. While accepting world inequality, the world market and imperialism as fundamental features of historical capitalism, Wallerstein broke with orthodox dependency theory's central proposition. For Wallerstein, core countries do not exploit poor countries for two basic reasons.

Firstly, core capitalists exploit workers in all zones of the capitalist world economy (not just the periphery) and therefore, the crucial redistribution between core and periphery is surplus value, not "wealth" or "resources" abstractly conceived. Secondly, core states do not exploit poor states, as dependency theory proposes, because capitalism is organised around an inter-regional and transnational division of labor rather than an international division of labour.

During the Industrial Revolution, for example, English capitalists exploited slaves (unfree workers) in the cotton zones of the American South, a peripheral region within a semiperipheral country, United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1989). The Modern World-System III. San Diego: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

From a largely Weberian perspective, [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] described the main tenets of dependency theory as follows:

* There is a financial and technological penetration of the [[periphery countries|periphery]] and [[semi-periphery countries]] by the developed capitalist [[core countries]].
* That produces an unbalanced economic structure within the peripheral societies and between them and the central countries.
* That leads to limitations upon self-sustained growth in the periphery.
* That helps the appearance of specific patterns of class relations.
* They require modifications in the role of the state to guarantee the functioning of the economy and the political articulation of a society, which contains, within itself, foci of inarticulateness and structural imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso, F. H. (1979). Development under Fire. Mexico D.F.: Instituto Latinoamericano de Estudios Transnacionales, DEE/D/24 i, Mayo (Mexico 20 D.F., Apartado 85 - 025). Cited after Arno Tausch, Almas Heshmati, [http://ftp.iza.org/dp4393.pdf Re-Orient? MNC Penetration and Contemporary Shifts in the Global Political Economy], September 2009, IZA Discussion Paper No. 4393&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency and world system theory propose that the [[poverty]] and backwardness of poor countries are caused by their peripheral position in the international [[division of labor]]. Since the capitalist world system evolved, the distinction between the central and the peripheral nations has grown and diverged. In recognizing a tripartite pattern in division of labor, world-systems analysis criticized [[dependency theory]] with its bimodal system of only cores and peripheries.

===Immanuel Wallerstein===
The best-known version of the world-systems approach was developed by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Wallerstein notes that world-systems analysis calls for an unidisciplinary historical social science and contends that the modern disciplines, products of the 19th century, are deeply flawed because they are not separate logics, as is manifest for example in the ''de facto'' overlap of analysis among scholars of the disciplines.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Wallerstein offers several definitions of a [[world-system]], defining it in 1974 briefly:

{{quote|a system is defined as a unit with a single division of labor and multiple cultural systems.&lt;ref name="Wallerstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel|date=Sep 1974|title=Wallerstein. 1974. "The Rise and Future Demise of the World-Capitalist System: Concepts for Comparative Analysis|journal=[[Comparative Studies in Society and History]]|volume=16|issue=4|page=390|url=http://bev.berkeley.edu/ipe/readings/Wallerstein.pdf}} Cited after [http://www.sociology.emory.edu/globalization/theories01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also offered a longer definition:

{{quote|...a social system, one that has boundaries, structures, member groups, rules of legitimation, and coherence. Its life is made up of the conflicting forces which hold it together by tension and tear it apart as each group seeks eternally to remold it to its advantage. It has the characteristics of an organism, in that it has a life-span over which its characteristics change in some respects and remain stable in others. One can define its structures as being at different times strong or weak in terms of the internal logic of its functioning.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) ''The Modern World-System'', New York, Academic Press, pp. 347-57.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1987, Wallerstein again defined it:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;not the system of the world, but a system that is a world and which can be, most often has been, located in an area less than the entire globe. World-systems analysis argues that the units of social reality within which we operate, whose rules constrain us, are for the most part such world-systems (other than the now extinct, small minisystems that once existed on the earth). World-systems analysis argues that there have been thus far only two varieties of world-systems: world-economies and world empires. A world-empire (examples, the [[Roman Empire]], [[Han China]]) are large bureaucratic structures with a single political center and an axial division of labor, but multiple cultures. A world-economy is a large axial division of labor with multiple political centers and multiple cultures. In English, the hyphen is essential to indicate these concepts. "World system" without a hyphen suggests that there has been only one world-system in the history of the world.|&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

Wallerstein characterises the world system as a set of mechanisms, which redistributes surplus value from the ''[[periphery countries|periphery]]'' to the ''[[core countries|core]]''. In his terminology, the ''core'' is the developed, [[industrialized]] part of the world, and the ''periphery'' is the "[[underdeveloped]]", typically raw materials-exporting, poor part of the world; the ''market'' being the means by which the ''core'' exploits the ''periphery''.

Apart from them, Wallerstein defines four temporal features of the world system. ''Cyclical rhythms'' represent the short-term fluctuation of [[economy]], and ''secular trends'' mean deeper long run tendencies, such as general [[economic growth]] or decline.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; The term ''contradiction'' means a general controversy in the system, usually concerning some short term versus long term tradeoffs. For example, the problem of [[underconsumption]], wherein the driving down of wages increases the profit for capitalists in the short term, but in the long term, the decreasing of wages may have a crucially harmful effect by reducing the demand for the product. The last temporal feature is the ''crisis'': a crisis occurs if a constellation of circumstances brings about the end of the system.

In Wallerstein's view, there have been three kinds of historical systems across human history: "mini-systems" or what anthropologists call bands, tribes, and small chiefdoms, and two types of world systems, one that is politically unified and the other is not (single state world [[empire]]s and multi-polity world economies).&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; World systems are larger, and are ethnically diverse. Modernity is unique in being the first and only fully capitalist world economy to have emerged around 1450 to 1550 and to have [[geography|geographically]] expanded across the entire planet, by about 1900. Not being political unified, many political units are included within the world system loosely tied together in an interstate system. Efficient division of labor is the unifying element of the different units, and it is also a function of capitalism, a system based on [[competition]] between free producers using [[wage labour|free labor]] with free commodities, 'free' meaning available for sale and purchase on a [[market (economics)|market]]. More specifically, it can be described as focusing on endless accumulation of capital; in other words, accumulation of capital in order to accumulate more capital. Such capitalism has a mutually dependent relationship with the world economy since it provides the efficient division of labour, the unifying element of the world economy, through the process of accumulating wealth. Likewise, such capitalism is dependent on the world economy since the latter provides a large market and a multiplicity of states, enabling capitalists to choose to work with states helping their interests.&lt;ref name=IW-D /&gt;

===Research questions===
World-systems theory asks several key questions:

* How is the world system affected by changes in its components (e.g. nations, ethnic groups, social classes, etc.)?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* How does it affect its components?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* To what degree, if any, does the core need the periphery to be underdeveloped?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* What causes world systems to change?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* What system may replace capitalism?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

Some questions are more specific to certain subfields; for example, [[Marxist]]s would concern themselves whether world-systems theory is a useful or unhelpful development of Marxist theories.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{See also|Core-periphery}}

World-systems analysis argues that capitalism, as a historical system, has always integrated a variety of labor forms within a functioning division of labor (world economy). Countries do not have economies but are part of the world economy. Far from being separate societies or worlds, the world economy manifests a tripartite [[division of labor]], with core, semiperipheral and peripheral zones. In the core zones, businesses, with the support of states they operate within, monopolise the most profitable activities of the division of labor.

There are many ways to attribute a specific country to the core, semi-periphery, or periphery. Using an empirically based sharp formal definition of "[[wikt:domination|domination]]" in a two-country relationship, Piana in 2004 defined the "core" as made up of "free countries" dominating others without being dominated, the "semi-periphery" as the countries that are dominated (usually, but not necessarily, by core countries) but at the same time dominating others (usually in the periphery) and "periphery" as the countries dominated. Based on 1998 data, the full list of countries in the three regions, together with a discussion of methodology, can be found.

The late 18th and early 19th centuries marked a great turning point in the development of capitalism in that capitalists achieved state society power in the key states, which furthered the industrial revolution marking the rise of capitalism. World-systems analysis contends that capitalism as a historical system formed earlier and that countries do not "develop" in stages, but the system does, and events have a different meaning as a phase in the development of historical capitalism, the emergence of the three ideologies of the national developmental mythology (the idea that countries can develop through stages if they pursue the right set of policies): conservatism, liberalism, and radicalism.

Proponents of world-systems analysis see the world stratification system the same way [[Karl Marx]] viewed class (ownership versus nonownership of the means of production) and [[Max Weber]] viewed class (which, in addition to ownership, stressed occupational skill level in the production process). The core nations primarily own and control the major means of production in the world and perform the higher-level production tasks. The periphery nations own very little of the world's means of production (even when they are located in periphery nations) and provide less-skilled labour. Like a class system with a nation, class positions in the [[world economy]] result in an unequal distribution of rewards or resources. The core nations receive the greatest share of surplus production, and periphery nations receive the smallest share. Furthermore, core nations are usually able to purchase raw materials and other goods from non-core nations at low prices and demand higher prices for their exports to non-core nations. Chirot (1986) lists the five most important benefits coming to core nations from their domination of periphery nations:

# Access to a large quantity of raw material
# Cheap labour
# Enormous profits from direct [[capital investments]]
# A market for [[exports]]
# Skilled professional labor through [[human migration|migration]] of these people from the non-core to the core.&lt;ref name=chirot1986&gt;Chirot, Daniel. 1986. ''Social Change in the Modern Era.'' New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wallerstein, the unique qualities of the modern world system include its capitalistic nature, its truly global nature, and the fact that it is a world economy that has not become politically unified into a world empire.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

===Core nations===
{{Main article|core countries}}
* Are the most economically diversified, wealthy, and powerful (economically and militarily)&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Have strong central governments, controlling extensive bureaucracies and powerful militaries&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Have stronger and more complex state institutions that help manage economic affairs internally and externally
* Have a sufficient tax base so state institutions can provide infrastructure for a strong economy
* Highly industrialised and produce manufactured goods rather than raw materials for export&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Increasingly tend to specialise in information, finance and service industries
* More often in the forefront of new technologies and new industries. Examples today include high-technology electronic and biotechnology industries. Another example would be assembly-line auto production in the early 20th century.
* Has strong [[bourgeois]] and [[working class]]es&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Have significant means of influence over non-core nations&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Relatively independent of outside control

Throughout the history of the modern world system, there has been a group of core nations competing with one another for access to the world's resources, economic dominance and [[hegemony]] over periphery nations. Occasionally, there has been one core nation with clear dominance over others.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; According to Immanuel Wallerstein, a core nation is dominant over all the others when it has a lead in three forms of economic dominance over a period of time:

# '''''Productivity dominance''''' allows a country to produce products of greater quality at a cheaper price, compared to other countries.
# Productivity dominance may lead to '''''trade dominance.''''' Now, there is a favorable balance of trade for the dominant nation since more countries are buying the products of the dominant country than buying from them.
# Trade dominance may lead to '''''financial dominance'''''. Now, more money is coming into the country than going out. Bankers of the dominant nation tend to receive more control of the world's financial resources.&lt;ref name=wallerstein1980&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1980. The Modern World System II: Mercantilism and the Consolidation of the European World-Economy, 1600-1750. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Military]] dominance is also likely after a nation reaches these three rankings. However, it has been posited that throughout the modern world system, no nation has been able to use its military to gain economic dominance. Each of the past dominant nations became dominant with fairly small levels of military spending and began to lose economic dominance with military expansion later on.&lt;ref name=kennedy1987&gt;Kennedy, Paul. 1987. ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict From 1500 to 2000.'' New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, cores were found in Northwestern Europe (England, France, Netherlands) but were later in other parts of the world (such as the United States, Canada, and Australia).&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

===Peripheral nations===
{{Main article|Periphery countries}}
* Are the least economically diversified
* Have relatively weak governments&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Have relatively weak institutions, with tax bases too small to support infrastructural development
* Tend to depend on one type of economic activity, often by extracting and exporting raw materials to core nations&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Tend to be the least industrialized&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Are often targets for investments from [[multinational corporation|multinational]] (or [[international corporation|transnational]]) [[corporation]]s from core nations that come into the country to exploit cheap unskilled labor in order to export back to core nations
* Have a small bourgeois and a large peasant classes&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Tend to have populations with high percentages of poor and uneducated people
* Tend to have very high social inequality because of small upper classes that own most of the land and have profitable ties to multinational corporations
* Tend to be extensively influenced by core nations and their multinational corporations and often forced to follow economic policies that help core nations and harm the long-term economic prospects of peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

Historically, peripheries were found outside Europe, such as in [[Latin America]] and today in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

===Semi-peripheral nations===
{{Main article|Semiperiphery countries}}
Semi-peripheral nations are those that are midway between the core and periphery.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Thus, they have to keep themselves from falling into the category of peripheral nations and at the same time, they strive to join the category of core nations. Therefore, they tend to apply protectionist policies most aggressively among the three categories of nations.&lt;ref name=IW-D&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel Maurice. "The Modern World System as a Capitalist World-Economy." ''World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction.'' Durham: Duke UP, 2004. 23-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be countries moving towards industrialization and more diversified economies. These regions often have relatively developed and diversified economies but are not dominant in international trade.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; They tend to export more to peripheral nations and import more from core nations in trade. According to some scholars, such as Chirot, they are not as subject to outside manipulation as peripheral societies; but according to others (Barfield), they have "periperial-like" relations to the core.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=chirot1977&gt;Chirot, Daniel. 1977. Social Change in the Twentieth Century. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; While in the sphere of influence of some cores, semiperipheries also tend to exert their own control over some peripheries.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Further, semi-peripheries act as buffers between cores and peripheries&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; and thus "...partially deflect the political pressures which groups primarily located in peripheral areas might otherwise direct against core-states" and stabilise the world system.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;

Semi-peripheries can come into existence from developing peripheries and declining cores.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Historically, two examples of semiperipheral nations would be Spain and Portugal, which fell from their early core positions but still managed to retain influence in Latin America.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Those countries imported silver and gold from their American colonies but then had to use it to pay for manufactured goods from core countries such as England and France.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; In the 20th century, nations like the "settler colonies" of Australia, Canada and New Zealand had a semiperipheral status. In the 21st century, nations like Brazil, Russia, India, Israel, China, South Korea and South Africa (BRICS) are usually considered semiperipheral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morales Ruvalcaba|first1=Daniel Efrén|title=INSIDE THE BRIC: ANALYSIS OF THE SEMIPERIPHERAL NATURE OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA|journal=Austral: Brazilian Journal of Strategy &amp; International Relations|date=11 September 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/austral/article/view/40942/26976|language=es|issn=2238-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External areas===
External areas are those that maintain socially necessary divisions of labor independent of the capitalist world economy.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

==Interpretation of world history==
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|400px|The 13th century world-system]]
Before the 16th century, [[Europe]] was dominated by [[feudal]] economies.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; European economies grew from mid-12th to 14th century but from 14th to mid 15th century, they suffered from a major crisis.&lt;ref name=glob&gt;Frank Lechner, [http://www.sociology.emory.edu/globalization/theories01.html Globalization theories: World-System Theory], 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Wallerstein explains this crisis as caused by the following:
# stagnation or even decline of agricultural production, increasing the burden of peasants,
# decreased agricultural productivity caused by changing climatological conditions ([[Little Ice Age]]),
# an increase in epidemics ([[Black Death]]),
# optimum level of the feudal economy having been reached in its [[economic cycle]]; the economy moved beyond it and entered a [[Depression (economics)|depression]] period.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt;

As a response to the failure of the feudal system, Europe embraced the capitalist system.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Europeans were motivated to develop technology to explore and trade around the world, using their superior military to take control of the trade routes.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; Europeans exploited their initial small advantages, which led to an accelerating process of accumulation of wealth and power in Europe.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

Wallerstein notes that never before had an economic system encompassed that much of the world, with trade links crossing so many political boundaries.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; In the past, geographically large economic systems existed but were mostly limited to spheres of domination of large empires (such as the [[Roman Empire]]); development of capitalism enabled the world economy to extend beyond individual states.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; [[International division of labor]] was crucial in deciding what relationships exists between different regions, their labor conditions and political systems.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; For classification and comparison purposes, Wallerstein introduced the categories of core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external countries.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Cores monopolized the capital-intensive production, and the rest of the world could provide only workforce and raw resources.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; The resulting inequality reinforced existing unequal development.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

According to Wallerstein there have only been three periods in which a core nation dominated in the modern world-system, with each lasting less than one hundred years. In the initial centuries of the rise of Europe, Northwestern Europe constituted the core, Mediterranean Europe the semiperiphery, and Eastern Europe and the Western hemisphere (and parts of Asia) the periphery.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Around 1450, Spain and Portugal took the early lead when conditions became right for a capitalist world-economy. They led the way in establishing overseas colonies. However, Portugal and Spain lost their lead, primarily by becoming overextended with [[empire]]-building. It became too expensive to dominate and protect so many colonial territories around the world.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chirot1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallerstein1974&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1974. ''The Modern World System: Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the 16th Century.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fleuten 1647.jpg|right|thumb|Dutch [[fluyt]]s of the seventeenth century]]
The first nation to gain clear dominance was the Netherlands in the 17th century, after its revolution led to a new financial system that many historians consider revolutionary.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt; An impressive [[shipbuilding]] industry also contributed to their economic dominance through more exports to other countries.&lt;ref name="chirot1986" /&gt; Eventually, other countries began to copy the financial methods and efficient production created by the Dutch. After the Dutch gained their dominant status, the [[standard of living]] rose, pushing up production costs.&lt;ref name="wallerstein1980" /&gt;

Dutch [[bankers]] began to go outside of the country seeking profitable investments, and the flow of [[capital (economics)|capital]] moved, especially to England.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt; By the end of the 17th century, conflict among core nations increased as a result of the economic decline of the Dutch. Dutch [[financial investment]] helped England gain [[productivity]] and trade dominance, and Dutch military support helped England to defeat France, the other country competing for dominance at the time.

[[File:British Empire 1921.png|left|400px|thumb|Map showing the British Empire in 1921]]
In the 19th century, Britain replaced the Netherlands as the hegemon.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; As a result of the new British dominance, the world system became relatively stable again during the 19th century. The British began to expand globally, with many colonies in the New World, Africa, and Asia. The colonial system began to place a strain on the British military and, along with other factors, led to an economic decline. Again there was a great deal of core conflict after the British lost their clear dominance. This time it was Germany, and later Italy and Japan that provided the new threat.

[[Industrialization]] was another ongoing process during British dominance, resulting in the diminishing importance of the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; In the 18th century, Britain was Europe's leading industrial and agricultural producer; by 1900, only 10% of England's population was working in the [[agricultural sector]].&lt;ref name=PH /&gt;

By 1900, the modern world system appeared very different from that of a century earlier in that most of the periphery societies had already been colonised by one of the older core nations.&lt;ref name="chirot1986" /&gt; In 1800, the old European core claimed 35% of the world's territory, but by 1914, it claimed 85% of the world's territory, with the [[Scramble for Africa]] closing out the imperial era.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt; If a core nation wanted periphery areas to exploit as had done the Dutch and British, these periphery areas had to be taken from another core nation, which the US did by way of the [[Spanish–American War]], and Germany, and then Japan and Italy, attempted to do in the leadup to [[World War II]]. The modern world system was thus geographically global, and even the most remote regions of the world had all been integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref name=TB /&gt;&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

As countries vied for core status, so did the United States. The [[American Civil War]] led to more power for the Northern industrial elites, who were now better able to pressure the government for policies helping industrial expansion. Like the Dutch bankers, British bankers were putting more investment toward the United States. The US had a small [[military budget]] compared to other industrial nations at the time.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt;

The US began to take the place of the British as a new dominant nation after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; With Japan and Europe in ruins after [[World War II]], the US was able to dominate the modern world system more than any other country in history, while the [[USSR]] and to a lesser extent China were viewed as primary threats.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; At its height, US economic reach accounted for over half of the world's industrial production, owned two thirds of the [[gold reserves]] in the world and supplied one third of the world's exports.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt;

However, since the end of the [[Cold War]], the future of US hegemony has been questioned by some scholars, as its hegemonic position has been in decline for a few decades.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; By the end of the 20th century, the core of the wealthy industrialized countries was composed of Western Europe, the United States, Japan and a rather limited selection of other countries.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; The semiperiphery was typically composed of independent states that had not achieved Western levels of influence, while poor [[decolonization|former colonies]] of the West formed most of the periphery.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

==Criticisms==
World-systems theory has attracted criticisms from its rivals; notably for being too focused on economy and not enough on [[culture]] and for being too core-centric and state-centric.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; [[William I. Robinson]] has criticized world-systems theory for its nation-state centrism, state-structuralist approach, and its inability to conceptualize the rise of globalization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|date=2011-11-01|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|url=http://iss.sagepub.com/content/26/6/723|journal=International Sociology|language=en|volume=26|issue=6|pages=723–745|doi=10.1177/0268580910393372|issn=0268-5809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson suggests that world-systems theory doesn't account for emerging transnational social forces and the relationships forged between them and global institutions serving their interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These forces operate on a global, rather than state system and cannot be understood by Wallerstein's nation-centered approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Wallerstein himself, critique of the world-systems approach comes from four directions: the positivists, the orthodox Marxists, the state autonomists, and the culturalists.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; The positivists criticise the approach as too prone to [[generalization]], lacking [[quantitative data]] and failing to put forth a [[falsifiable]] proposition.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Orthodox Marxists find the world-systems approach deviating too far from orthodox Marxist principles, such as by not giving enough weight to the concept of [[social class]].&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; The state autonomists criticize the theory for blurring the boundaries between state and businesses.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Further, the positivists and the state autonomists argue that state should be the central [[unit of analysis]].&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Finally, the culturalists argue that world-systems theory puts too much importance on the economy and not enough on the culture.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; In Wallerstein's own words:

{{quote|In short, most of the criticisms of world-systems analysis criticize it for what it explicitly proclaims as its perspective. World-systems analysis views these other modes of analysis as defective and/or limiting in scope and calls for unthinking them.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

One of the fundamental conceptual problems of the world-system theory is that the assumptions that define its actual conceptual units are social systems. The assumptions, which define them, need to be examined as well as how they are related to each other and how one changes into another. The essential argument of the world-system theory is that in the 16th century a capitalist world economy developed, which could be described as a world system.&lt;ref name="Pieterse"&gt;Jan Nederveen Pieterse,  A Critique of World System Theory, in International Sociology, Volume 3, Issue no. 3, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a theoretical critique concerned with the basic claims of world-system theory:
"There are today no socialist systems in the world-economy any more than there are feudal systems because there is only one world system. It is a world-economy and it is by definition capitalist in form." (Wallerstein 1979)&lt;ref name=Pieterse/&gt;

Robert Brenner has pointed out that the prioritization of the world market means the neglect of local class structures and class struggles:
"They fail to take into account either the way in which these class structures themselves emerge as the outcome of class struggles whose results are incomprehensible in terms merely of market forces." (Brenner 1982)&lt;ref name=Pieterse/&gt; Robert Brenner: Director of the Center for Social Theory and Comparative History at UCLA

Another criticism is that of reductionism made by Theda Skocpol: she believes the interstate system is far from being a simple superstructure of the capitalist world economy:
"The international states system as a transnational structure of military competition was not originally created by capitalism. Throughout modern world history, it represents an analytically autonomous level [... of] world capitalism, but [is] not reducible to it." (Skocpol 1979)&lt;ref name=Pieterse/&gt;

A concept that we can perceive as critique and mostly as renewal is the concept of coloniality ([[Anibal Quijano]], 2000, Nepantla, Coloniality of power, eurocentrism and Latin America &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unc.edu/~aescobar/wan/wanquijano.pdf|title=Quijano, 2000, Nepantla, Coloniality of power, eurocentrism and Latin America|author=|date=|website=unc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Issued from the think tank of the group "modernity/coloniality" ([[:es:Grupo modernidad/colonialidad]]) in Latin America, it re-uses the concept of world working division and core/periphery system in its system of coloniality. But criticizing the "core-centric" origin of World-system and its only economical development, "coloniality" allows further conception of how power still processes in a colonial way over worldwide populations (Ramon Grosfogel, "the epistemic decolonial turn" 2007 &lt;ref&gt;Ramon Grosfogel, "the epistemic decolonial turn", 2007&lt;/ref&gt;):" by "colonial situations" I mean the cultural, political, sexual, spiritual, epistemic and economic oppression/exploitation of subordinate racialized/ethnic groups by dominant racialized/ethnic groups with or without the existence of colonial administration". Coloniality covers, so far, several fields such as coloniality of gender ([[Maria Lugones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalstudies.trinity.duke.edu/wp-content/themes/cgsh/materials/WKO/v2d2_Lugones.pdf|title=M. Lugones, coloniality of gender, 2008|author=|date=|website=duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;), coloniality of "being" (Maldonado Torres), coloniality of knowledge ([[Walter Mignolo]]) and [[Coloniality of power]] ([[Anibal Quijano]]).

==New developments==
New developments in world systems research include studies on the cyclical processes. More specifically, it refers to the cycle of leading industries or products (ones that are new and have an important share of the overall world market for commodities), which is equal to dissolution of quasi-monopolies or other forms of partial monopolies achieved by core nations. Such forms of partial monopolies are achievable through ownership of leading industries or products, which require technological capabilities, patents, restrictions on imports and/or exports, government subsidies, etc. Such capabilities are most often found in core nations, which accumulate capital through achieving such quasi-monopolies with leading industries or products.

As capital is accumulated, employment and wage also increase, creating a sense of prosperity. This leads to increased production, and sometimes even [[overproduction]], causing price competition to arise. To lower production costs, production processes of the leading industries or products are relocated to semi-peripheral nations. When competition increases and quasi-monopolies cease to exist, their owners, often core nations, move on to other new leading industries or products, and the cycle continues.&lt;ref name=IW-D /&gt;

Other new developments include the consequences of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the roles of [[gender]] and the culture, studies of [[slavery]] and incorporation of new regions into the world system and the precapitalist world systems.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; Arguably, the greatest source of renewal in world-systems analysis since 2000 has been the synthesis of world-system and environmental approaches. Key figures in the "greening" of world-systems analysis include Minqi Li, Jason W. Moore, Andreas Malm, Stephen Bunker, Alf Hornborg, and Richard York.

===Time period===
Wallerstein traces the origin of today's world-system to the "long 16th century" (a period that began with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of the Americas]] by Western European sailors and ended with the [[English Revolution]] of 1640).&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;  And, according to Wallerstein, globalization, or the becoming of the world's system, is a process coterminous with the spread and development of capitalism over the past 500 years.

[[Janet Abu Lughod]] argues that a pre-modern world system extensive across Eurasia existed in the 13th century prior to the formation of the modern world-system identified by Wallerstein. [[Janet Abu Lughod]] contends that the [[Secret History of the Mongols|Mongol Empire]] played an important role in stitching together the Chinese, Indian, Muslim and European regions in the 13th century, before the rise of the modern world system.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lugod, Janet (1989), "Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250-1350"&lt;/ref&gt; In debates, Wallerstein contends that Lughod's system was not a "world-system" because it did not entail integrated production networks, but it was instead a vast trading network.

[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|left|The 11th century world system]]

[[Andre Gunder Frank]] goes further and claims that a global world system that includes Asia, Europe and Africa has existed since the [[4th millennium BCE]]. The centre of this system was in Asia, specifically China.&lt;ref&gt;André Gunder Frank, Barry K.

===Current research===
Wallerstein's theories are widely recognized throughout the world. In the United States, one of the hubs of world-systems research is at the [[Fernand Braudel Center|Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems and Civilizations]], at [[Binghamton University]].&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; Among the most important related periodicals are the ''[[Journal of World-Systems Research]]'', published by the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Section on the Political Economy of the World System (PEWS), and the ''[[Review, A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center|Review]]'', published the Braudel Center.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; 

Edythe E. Weeks asserts the proposition that it may be possible to consider, and apply critical insights, to prevent future patterns from emerging in ways to repeat outcomes harmful to humanity. (See ''Outer Space Development, Space Law and International Relations: A Method for Elucidating Seeds'' (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012)). Her current research, as a Fulbright Specialist, further suggests that new territories such as the Antarctic Peninsula, Antarctica, the Arctic and various regions of outer space, including low Earth orbit, the geostationary orbit, Near Earth orbit are currently in the process of colonization. By applying lessons learned from our past, we can change the future towards a direction less likely to be widely criticized.

Muhammed Asadi suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose superior economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the command states (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them. Militarized States have a life cycle in which destruction is almost inevitable and since their economic growth stabilizes the dominant economies it seldom translates into personal economic development &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/dissertations/447/|title=The Military, Economy and the State: A New International System Analysis|first=Asadi, Muhammed|last=A.|date=16 May 2018|journal=Dissertations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Trade Report''' (WTR) is the annual report published since 2003 by the [[World Trade Organization]]. Each WTR provides an in-depth analysis of an aspect of trends in [[international trade]], [[trade policy]] issues and the multilateral trading system.

==2016 Report==
The [https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/wtr16_e.htm 2016 World Trade Report] examines the participation of [[Small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) in international trade, how the international trade landscape is changing for SMEs, and what the multilateral trading system does and can do to encourage more widespread and inclusive SME participation in [[global markets]].

'''World energy consumption''' is the total [[energy]] used by the entire human [[civilization]]. Typically measured per year, it involves all energy harnessed from every [[energy development|energy source]] applied towards humanity's endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector, across every country. It does not include energy from food, and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented.  Being the power source metric of civilization, World Energy Consumption has deep implications for humanity's socio-economic-political sphere.

Institutions such as the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA), and the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA) record and publish energy data periodically. Improved data and understanding of World Energy Consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns, which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions.

Closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total [[primary energy]] supply (TPES), which - on a global level - is the sum of energy production minus storage changes. Since changes of energy storage over the year are minor, TPES values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption. However, TPES ignores conversion efficiency, overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency (e.g. [[coal]], gas and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]]) and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms (e.g. [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic]] or [[hydroelectricity]]). The IEA estimates that, in 2013, total primary energy supply (TPES) was 1.575 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[Watt hour|Wh]] (= 157.5 PWh, 157,500 TWh, 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s, or 13,541 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]) or about 18 TW-year.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title= IEA - Key world energy statistics, 2015 |url=ftp://ftp.energia.bme.hu/pub/energetikai_alapismeretek/KeyWorld_Statistics_2015.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth. The use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth, followed by hydropower and renewable energy. Renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period. The demand for nuclear energy decreased, in part due to nuclear disasters (e.g. [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] 1979, [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] 1986, and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] 2011).&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="undp"&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/sustainable-energy/world-energy-assessment-energy-and-the-challenge-of-sustainability/World%20Energy%20Assessment-2000.pdf World Energy Assessment] (WEA).

In 2011, expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion USD, or about 10% of the world [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Europe spends close to one-quarter of the world's energy expenditures, North America close to 20%, and Japan 6%.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Desbrosses, [http://www.leonardo-energy.org/blog/world-energy-expenditures World Energy Expenditures], Leonardo Energy, Nov. 28 2011 (accessed 30 January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

World [[primary energy|total primary energy supply]] (TPES), or "primary energy" differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers. For instance, when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline, so that it can be used in a car, and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers. World final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world's primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity.

Also, one needs to bear in mind that there are different [[Energy quality|qualities of energy]]. Heat, especially at a relatively low temperature, is low-quality energy, whereas electricity is high-quality energy. It takes around 3&amp;nbsp;kWh of heat to produce 1&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity. But by the same token, a kilowatt-hour of this high-quality electricity can be used to pump several kilowatt-hours of heat into a building using a heat pump. And electricity can be used in many ways in which heat cannot. So the "loss" of energy incurred when generating electricity is not the same as a loss due, say, to resistance in power lines

In 2014, world primary energy supply amounted to 155,481&amp;nbsp;terawatt-hour (TWh) or 13,541&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]], while the world final energy consumption was 109,613&amp;nbsp;TWh or about 29.5% less than the total supply.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2016"/&gt; World final energy consumption includes products as lubricants, asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel. This non-energy use amounted to 
9,723 TWh (836 Mtoe) in 2015.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2017"/&gt;

The United States [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) regularly publishes a report on world consumption for most types of primary energy resources. For 2013, estimated world energy consumption was 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; joules, or 157,481&amp;nbsp;TWh. According to the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] the total world energy consumption in past years was 143,851 TWh in 2008, 133,602&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, 117,687&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000, and 102,569&amp;nbsp;TWh in 1990.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015" /&gt; In 2012 approximately 22% of world energy was consumed in North America, 5% was consumed South and Central America, 23% was consumed in Europe and Eurasia, 3% was consumed in Africa, and 40% was consumed in the Asia Pacific region.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

===Electricity generation===
The total amount of electricity consumed worldwide was 19,504&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2013, 16,503&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2008, 15,105&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, and 12,116&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000. 
By the end of 2014, the total installed electricity generating capacity worldwide was nearly 6.142 [[Terawatt|TW]] (million MW) which only includes generation connected to local [[electricity grid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Electricity - Installed generating capacity, 2014 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2236.html#xx|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition there is an unknown amount of heat and electricity consumed off-grid by isolated villages and industries. 
In 2014, the share of world energy consumption for electricity generation by source was coal at 40.8%, natural gas at 21.6%, nuclear at 10.6%, hydro at 16.4%, other sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, etc.) at 6.3% and oil at 4.3%. 
Coal and natural gas were the most used energy fuels for generating electricity. 
The world's electricity consumption was 18,608&amp;nbsp;TWh {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} in 2012. 
This figure is about 18% smaller than the generated electricity, due to grid losses, storage losses, and self-consumption from power plants ([[gross generation]]). 
[[Cogeneration]] (CHP) power stations use some of the heat that is otherwise wasted for use in buildings or in industrial processes.

In 2016 while total world energy came from 80% fossil fuels, 10% biofuels, 5% nuclear and 5% renewable (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal), only 18% of that total world energy was in the form of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/shell-scenarios-energy-models/world-energy-model/_jcr_content/par/textimage.stream/1510344160326/d62f12b8fe88e85dc3349c38b1ca5e44cc22c5ccc6f70beed634020cfb527c82/shell-world-energy-model.pdf pg4&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other 82% was used for heat and transportation.

Recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Global energy: perspectives"&gt;{{cite book |last= Nakićenović |first= Nebojša |last2= Grübler|first2= Arnulf |last3= McDonald|first3= Alan | date= 1998 |title= Global energy: perspectives |location= Cambridge, New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0521642000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt; From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, oil, coal, and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy. The following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

The energy consumption growth in the G20 slowed down to 2% in 2011, after the strong increase of 2010. The economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth. For several years now, the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish Chinese and Indian markets, while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies, high oil prices, resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/energy-press-releases/sluggish-growth-world-energy-demand-in-2011.php|title=Sluggish growth of World energy demand in 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] data from 1990 to 2008, the average energy use per person increased 10% while world population increased 27%. Regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008: the Middle East increased by 170%, China by 146%, India by 91%, Africa by 70%, Latin America by 66%, the USA by 20%, the EU-27 block by 7%, and world overall grew by 39%.

In 2008, total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours ([[TWh]]) or 474 exajoules ([[exajoules|EJ]]).&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web |work= Statistical Review of World Energy 2009 |publisher= [[BP]] |url= http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20–%20Consumption'!A1 |title= Consumption by fuel, 1965–2008 |format= XLS |date= 8 June 2009 |accessdate= 24 October 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130726202544/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20–%20Consumption'!A1 |archivedate= 26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, primary energy demand increased to 158,000 TWh (567&amp;nbsp;EJ).&lt;ref name=EIAIES2015&gt;{{cite web |title= International Energy Statistics|accessdate= 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy consumption in the [[Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors|G20]] increased by more than 5% in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009. In 2009, world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1%, or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent ([[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]), as a result of the financial and economic crisis, which reduced world GDP by 0.6% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/publications/world-energy-statistics-supply-and-demand.php|title=World Energy Statistics – Energy Supply &amp; Demand |publisher= Enerdata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This evolution is the result of two contrasting trends: Energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries, specifically in Asia (+4%). Conversely, in OECD, consumption was severely cut by 4.7% in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels. In North America, Europe and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], consumptions shrank by 4.5%, 5% and 8.5% respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity. China became the world's largest energy consumer (18% of the total) since its consumption surged by 8% during 2009 (up from 4% in 2008). Oil remained the largest energy source (33%) despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time. Coal posted a growing role in the world's energy consumption: in 2009, it accounted for 27% of the total.

Most energy is used in the country of origin, since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials. In 2008, the share export of the total energy production by fuel was: oil 50% (1,952/3,941&amp;nbsp;Mt), gas 25% (800/3,149&amp;nbsp;bcm) and hard coal 14% (793/5,845&amp;nbsp;Mt).&lt;ref name=IEA20109&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] and [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2009/key_stats_2009.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2009] oil page 11, gas p.13, hard coal (excluding brown coal) p. 15 and electricity p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the world's high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun's rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet. Some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy, some is directly or indirectly usable; for example, via solar PV/thermal, wind, hydro- or wave power. The total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter ''(see [[solar constant]])'', though it fluctuates by about 6.9% during the year due to the Earth's varying distance from the sun. This value, after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the Earth, is the total rate of [[Solar energy#Energy from the Sun|solar energy]] received by the planet; about half, 89,000&amp;nbsp;TW, reaches the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= William |last= Schreiber |url= http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/196/schreiber.html |title= Solving the Energy Problem |work= MIT Faculty Newsletter |date=May–June 2007 |accessdate= 2016-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary, with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4&amp;nbsp; yottajoule ([[Yottajoule|YJ]]) or 4 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; joules, and the available nuclear fuel such as [[uranium]] exceeding 2.5&amp;nbsp;YJ. Fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3&amp;nbsp;YJ if estimates of reserves of [[methane clathrates]] are accurate and become technically extractable. The total power flux from the sun intercepting the Earth is 5.5&amp;nbsp;YJ per year, though not all of this is available for human consumption. The IEA estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of $48 trillion and "credible policy frameworks."&lt;ref name="IEAreport"&gt;{{cite news |title= IEA estimates $48tn investments till 2035 to meet global energy demands |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-03/energy-supply-requires-40-trillion-investment-to-2035-iea-says.html |accessdate= 4 June 2014 |publisher= [[Bloomberg News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to IEA (2012) the goal of limiting warming to 2&amp;nbsp;°C is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes. If action is not taken before 2017, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017. Fossil fuels are dominant in the global [[energy mix]], supported by $523 billion subsidies in 2011, up almost 30% on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf IEA World Energy Outlook 2012 Executive Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emissions ===
[[Global warming]] [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] resulting from energy production are an [[environmental problem]]. Efforts to resolve this include the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (1997) and the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015), international governmental agreements aiming to [[Climate change mitigation|reduce harmful climate impacts]], which a number of nations have signed. Limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, thought to be a risk by the [[Stockholm Environmental Institute|SEI]], is now doubtful.

To limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees Celsius rise would demand a 75% decline in [[carbon emissions]] in industrial countries by 2050, if the population is 10 billion in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Energiläget 2050 by prof. Cristian Azar and Kristian Lindgren [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers]] [[Göteborg]] {{sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across 40 years, this averages to a 2% decrease every year. In 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem. Hypothetically, according to [[Robert Engelman]] (Worldwatch institute), in order to prevent collapse, human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population (2009).&lt;ref&gt;''State of the world 2009'', [[Worldwatch Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenhouse gases]] are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption. Large amounts of pollutants such as [[sulphurous oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[particulate matter]] (PM) are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass; the [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/|title=WHO - 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] [[combustion]] is a major contributor.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to producing air pollution like [[fossil fuel]] combustion, most biomass has high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfpi.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/PFPI-biomass-carbon-accounting-overview_April.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fossil fuels ===
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}

The twentieth century saw a rapid twenty-fold increase in the use of fossil fuels. Between 1980 and 2006, the worldwide annual growth rate was 2%.&lt;ref name=EIA/&gt; According to the US [[Energy Information Administration]]'s 2006 estimate, the estimated 471.8&amp;nbsp;EJ total consumption in 2004, was divided as given in the table above, with fossil fuels supplying 86% of the world's energy:

====Coal====
{{Main article|Coal|List of countries by coal production}}

In 2000, China accounted for 28% of world coal consumption, other Asia consumed 19%, North America 25% and the EU 14%. The single greatest coal-consuming country is China. Its share of the world coal production was 28% in 2000 and rose to 48% in 2009. In contrast to China's ~70% increase in coal consumption, world coal use increased 48% from 2000 to 2009. In practice, the majority of this growth occurred in China and the rest in other Asia.&lt;ref name="energisve2010Coal"/&gt; China's energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector, the majority of which comes from coal consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Damien. "China's Coming Decade of Natural Gas". ''Asia's Uncertain LNG Future, NBR Special Report''. November 2013. Retrieved 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

World annual coal production increased 1,905&amp;nbsp;Mt or 32% in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005, of which over 70% was in China and 8% in India. Coal production was in 2011 7,783&amp;nbsp;Mt, and 2009 6,903&amp;nbsp;Mt, equal to 12.7% production increase in two years.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012, 2010 and 2006 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

If production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008, proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years. This is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe. Coal is the largest source of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions in the world. According to [[James Hansen]] the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from [[Coal mining|coal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/true-cost-coal.pdf The True Cost of Coal] 27 November 2008 pp. 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Energy in Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Energy in Australia|Australia]] exported together 57.1% of the world coal export in 2011. China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan had 65% share of all the world coal import in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oil ====
{{Main article|Petroleum|List of countries by oil production|List of countries by oil consumption}}

Coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century. With the advent of the automobile, aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity, [[Petroleum|oil]] became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century. The growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973. After the oil shocks of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]], during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 US dollars per barrel, there was a shift away from oil.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. 792&lt;/ref&gt; Coal, natural gas, and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency. In the U.S. the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon. Japan, which bore the brunt of the oil shocks, made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world.&lt;ref name = "IEAKey"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/key2006.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= International Energy Agency |title= Key World Energy Statistics |year= 2006 |accessdate= 3 April 2007 }} pp. 48–57&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 2008, the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased. From 2003 to 2008, coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Page numbers needed on book sources --&gt;

It is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090507072830.htm How Much Oil Have We Used?], [[Science Daily]], 8 May 2009. Retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natural Gas ====
{{Main article|Natural Gas|List of countries by natural gas production|List of countries by natural gas consumption}}

In 2009, the world use of natural gas grew 31% compared to 2000. 66% of this growth was outside EU, North America, Latin America, and Russia. Others include the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The gas supply increased also in the previous regions: 8.6% in the EU and 16% in the North America 2000–2009.&lt;ref name="energiläget2010G"/&gt;

Based on [[REN21]]'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$214 billion in 2013, with countries like [[Renewable energy in China|China]] and the [[Renewable energy in the United States|United States]] heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels.&lt;ref name="ria21-GSR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title= Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author= [[REN21]] |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate= 4 September 2014 |year= 2014 |pages= 13, 17, 21, 25 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries.

From 2000 to 2013 the total renewable energy use has increased 6,450 TWh and total energy use 40,500 TWh.

==== Hydro ====
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity|Hydropower}}

Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by [[hydropower]]; the production of electrical power through the use of the kinetic energy of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which continues the rapid rate of increase experienced between 2003 and 2009.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with {{convert|721|TWh|PJ|abbr=on|order=flip}} of production in 2010, representing around 17% of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10&amp;nbsp;GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] in Brazil, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title= Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |publisher= Worldwatch Institute |date= January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|worlds top 10 renewable electricity producers]] are primarily hydroelectric, one is wind.

==== Marine energy ====
{{Main article|Ocean energy}}
[[Marine energy]], also known as ''ocean energy'' and ''marine and hydrokinetic energy'' (MHK) includes [[tidal power|tidal]] and [[wave power|wave]] power and is a relatively new sector of renewable energy, with most projects still in the pilot phase, but the theoretical potential is equivalent to 4–18 million tonne of oil equivalent (toe). MHK development in U.S. and international waters includes projects using devices such as, wave energy converters in open coastal areas with significant waves, tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas, in-stream [[turbine]]s in fast-moving [[river]]s, ocean current turbines in areas of strong [[marine current]]s, and [[ocean thermal energy converter]]s in deep tropical waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tethys |url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wind ====
{{Main article|Wind power|Wind power by country}}

Wind power is growing at the rate of 17% annually, with a worldwide [[Installed wind power capacity|installed capacity]] of 432,883&amp;nbsp;megawatts (MW) at the end of 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/graphs/ |title= GWEC Global Statistics |author= Global Wind Energy Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;Lars Kroldrup.

==== Solar ====
{{Main article|Solar energy|Solar power|Solar power by country}}

Solar energy, radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]], has been harnessed by humans since [[ancient history|ancient times]] using a range of ever-evolving technologies. Solar energy technologies include [[solar heating]], [[solar photovoltaics]], [[concentrated solar power]] and [[solar architecture]], which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces. The [[International Energy Agency]] projected that solar power could provide "a third of the global final energy demand after 2060, while CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be reduced to very low levels."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of [[photovoltaic system]]s and [[solar thermal collector]]s to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]]. From 2012 to 2016 solar capacity tripled and now provides 1.3% of global energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Geothermal ====
{{Main article|Geothermal energy|Geothermal power}}

[[Geothermal energy]] is used commercially in over 70 countries.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[MIT]] |title= The Future of Geothermal Energy |url= http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 7 February 2007 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110310030646/http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf |archive-date= 10 March 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, {{convert|200|PJ|TWh}} of electricity was generated from geothermal resources, and an additional {{convert|270|PJ|TWh}} of geothermal energy was used directly, mostly for space heating. In 2007, the world had a global capacity for {{val|10|u=GW}} of electricity generation and an additional {{val|28|u=GW}} of [[geothermal heating|direct heating]], including extraction by [[geothermal heat pumps]].&lt;ref name="Renewables2006"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st century |title= Renewables, Global Status Report 2006 |year= 2006 |accessdate= 3 April 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |archivedate= 18 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEO"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Ingvar B. |last1= Fridleifsson, |first2= Ruggero |last2= Bertani |first3= Ernst |last3= Huenges |first4= John W. |last4= Lund |first5= Arni |last5= Ragnarsson |first6= Ladislaus |last6= Rybach |date= 11 February 2008 |title= The possible role and contribution of geothermal energy to the mitigation of climate change |conference= IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources |editor= O.

==== Bio energy ====
{{Main article|Biomass|Biogas|Biofuel}}

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel, today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply. Electricity produced from [[biomass]] sources was estimated at 44&amp;nbsp;GW for 2005. Biomass electricity generation increased by over 100% in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. A further 220&amp;nbsp;GW was used for heating (in 2004), bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264&amp;nbsp;GW. The use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; World production of [[Ethanol fuel|bioethanol]] increased by 8% in 2005 to reach {{convert|33|GL|usgal|lk=on}}, with most of the increase in the United States, bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; [[Biodiesel]] increased by 85% to {{convert|3.9|GL|usgal}}, making it the fastest growing renewable energy source in 2005. Over 50% is produced in Germany.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt;

[[File:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|World energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]]

Energy consumption is loosely correlated with [[Gross National Product#Gross National Product|gross national product]] and climate, but there is a large difference even between the most highly developed countries, such as Japan and Germany with an energy consumption rate of 6&amp;nbsp;kW per person and the [[Energy use in the United States|United States]] with an energy consumption rate of 11.4&amp;nbsp;kW per person. In developing countries, particularly those that are sub-tropical or tropical such as India, the per person energy use rate is closer to 0.7&amp;nbsp;kW. Bangladesh has the lowest consumption rate with 0.2&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

The US consumes 25% of the world's energy with a share of global GDP at 22% and a share of the world population at 4.59%.&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://esa.un.org/UNPP/ |title= World Population Prospects |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= 7 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070321013235/http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |archive-date= 21 March 2007 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant growth of energy consumption is currently taking place in China, which has been growing at 5.5% per year over the last 25 years. Its population of 1.3 billion people (19.6% of the world population&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects" /&gt;) is consuming energy at a rate of 1.6&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

One measurement of efficiency is [[energy intensity]]. This is a measure of the amount of energy it takes a country to produce a dollar of gross domestic product.

The table to the right shows the amounts of energy consumed worldwide in 2012 by four sectors, according to the [[Energy Information Administration]] of the [[US Department of Energy]]:
*Residential (heating, lighting, and appliances)
*Commercial (lighting, heating and cooling of commercial buildings, and provision of water and sewer services)
*Industrial users (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction)
*Transportation (passenger, freight, and pipeline)
Of the total 120 PWh ({{val|120e15|ul=Wh}}) consumed, 19.4 were in the form of electricity, but this electricity required 61.7 PWh to produce. Thus the total energy consumption was around 160 PWh (ca {{val|550e15|ul=Btu}}).&lt;ref name=EIA2016/&gt; The efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy efficiency measures and technological improvements. |url= http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |publisher= e8.org |accessdate= 21 January 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204112155/http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |archivedate= 4 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }} Article by group of ten leading electricity companies&lt;/ref&gt; The new generation of gas-fired plants reaches a substantially higher efficiency of 55%.

Another report gives different values for the sectors, apparently due to different definitions. According to this, total world energy use per sector in 2008 was industry 28%, transport 27% and residential and service 36%. Division was about the same in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="energisve2010xS"/&gt;

===European Union===
The [[European Environmental Agency]] (EEA) measures final energy consumption (does not include energy used in production and lost in transportation) and finds that the transport sector is responsible for 31.8% of final energy consumption, households 26.2%, industry 25.6%, [[service (economics)|services]] 13.5% and agriculture 2.9% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;European Environmental Agency. {{Cite web|url = http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/final-energy-consumption-by-sector-8/assessment-2|title = Final energy consumption by sector and fuel (CSI 027/ENER 016) - Assessment published Jan 2015|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }} Retrieved 21 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of energy is responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions (79%), with the energy sector representing 31%, transport 19%, industry 13%, households 9% and others 7%.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Hoos [[European Commission]] 2011.

== Geology ==
[[File:Zealandia, topographic map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Topographic map of Zealandia]]
[[File:Ball's Pyramid2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.78|Most of Zealandia is underwater. [[Ball's Pyramid]], near [[Lord Howe Island]], is one place where it rises above sea level]]

Zealandia is largely made up of two nearly parallel ridges, separated by a [[Aulacogen|failed]] [[rift]], where the rift breakup of the continent stops and becomes a filled [[graben]]. The ridges rise above the [[seabed|sea floor]] to heights of {{convert|1000|-|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with few rocky [[island]]s rising above [[sea level]]. The ridges are continental rock, but are lower in elevation than normal continents because their crust is thinner than usual, approximately {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick, and consequently they do not float as high above the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].

About 25 million years ago, the southern part of Zealandia (on the [[Pacific Plate]]) began to shift relative to the northern part (on the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]). The resulting displacement by approximately {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the [[Alpine Fault]] is evident in geological maps.&lt;ref name="UNCLOS map"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unclosnz.org.nz/acretion_map.html |title=Figure 4. Basement rocks of New Zealand |work=UNCLOS Article 76: The Land mass, continental shelf, and deep ocean floor: Accretion and suturing |accessdate=21 April 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927142136/http://www.unclosnz.org.nz/acretion_map.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movement along this plate boundary has also offset the New Caledonia Basin from its previous continuation through the [[Bounty Trough]].

Compression across the boundary has uplifted the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]], although due to rapid erosion their height reflects only a small fraction of the uplift. Farther north, subduction of the Pacific Plate has led to extensive volcanism, including the [[Coromandel Peninsula|Coromandel]] and [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]]s. Associated rifting and subsidence has produced the Hauraki Graben and more recently the Whakatane Graben and Wanganui Basin.

Volcanism on Zealandia has also taken place repeatedly in various parts of the continental fragment before, during and after it [[rift]]ed away from the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Although Zealandia has shifted approximately {{convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest with respect to the underlying [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] from the time when it rifted from Antarctica, recurring intracontinental volcanism exhibits magma composition similar to that of volcanoes in previously adjacent parts of Antarctica and Australia.

This volcanism is widespread across Zealandia but generally of low volume apart from the huge mid to late [[Miocene]] [[shield volcano]]es that developed the [[Banks Peninsula|Banks]] and [[Otago Peninsula]]s. In addition, it took place continually in numerous limited regions all through the [[Late Cretaceous]] and the [[Cenozoic]]. However, its causes are still in dispute. During the [[Miocene]], the northern section of Zealandia ([[Lord Howe Rise]]) might have slid over a stationary [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], forming the [[Lord Howe Seamount Chain]].

Zealandia is occasionally divided by scientists into two regions, North Zealandia (or Western Province) and South Zealandia (or Eastern Province), the latter of which contains most of the Median [[Batholith]] crust.

The case for Zealandia being a continent in its own right was argued by Nick Mortimer and Hamish Campbell in their book ''Zealandia: Our continent revealed'' in 2014,&lt;ref name=MortimerCampbell2014 /&gt; citing geological and ecological evidence to support the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Yarwood, V. |url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-our-continent-revealed/ |series=Book Review |title=Zealandia: Our continent revealed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729235207/https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-our-continent-revealed/ |archive-date=29 July 2017 |magazine=New Zealand Geographic |date=November–December 2014 |access-date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a team of eleven geologists from New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Australia concluded that Zealandia fulfills all the requirements to be considered a drowned continent, rather than a microcontinent or continental fragment.&lt;ref name=mortimer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortimer |first1=Nick |last2=Campbell |first2=Hamish J. |title=Zealandia: Earth’s Hidden Continent |journal=GSA Today |volume=27 |year=2017 |url=https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/article/GSATG321A.1.htm |doi=10.1130/GSATG321A.1 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217064642/https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/article/GSATG321A.1.htm |archive-date=17 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely covered by news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Potter |first1=Randall |title=Meet Zealandia: Earth's latest continent |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/travel/zealandia-new-continent-discovered/ |agency=CNN |date=16 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217050332/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/travel/zealandia-new-continent-discovered/ |archivedate=17 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Elle |title=Zealandia – pieces finally falling together for continent we didn't know we had |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/zealandia-pieces-finally-falling-together-for-long-overlooked-continent |agency=The Guardian |date=16 February 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226124213/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/zealandia-pieces-finally-falling-together-for-long-overlooked-continent |archive-date=26 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=East |first1=Michael |title=Scientists discover 'Zealandia' – a hidden continent off the coast of Australia |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/16/scientists-discover-eighth-continent-zealandia/ |publisher=The Telegraph |date=16 February 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218202907/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/16/scientists-discover-eighth-continent-zealandia/ |archive-date=18 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biogeography ==
New Caledonia lies at the northern end of the ancient continent, while New Zealand rises at the plate boundary that bisects it. These land masses are two outposts of the [[Antarctic Flora]], including [[Araucaria]]s and [[Podocarp]]s. At [[Curio Bay]], logs of a [[fossil]]ized [[forest]] closely related to modern [[Kauri]] and [[Norfolk Pine]] can be seen that grew on Zealandia about 180 million years ago during the [[Jurassic]] period, before it split from Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |title=Fossil forest: Features of Curio Bay/Porpoise Bay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017015051/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |archive-date=17 October 2008 |access-date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were buried by volcanic mud flows and gradually replaced by [[silica]] to produce the fossils now exposed by the sea.

During glacial periods, more of Zealandia becomes a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] rather than a marine environment. Zealandia was originally thought to have no native land [[mammal]] fauna, but [[Saint Bathans mammal|the discovery in 2006 of a fossil mammal jaw]] from the [[Miocene]] in the [[Otago]] region shows otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Ancient New Zealand |last1=Campbell |first1=Hamish |author2=Gerard Hutching |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=North Shore, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-14-302088-2 |pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political divisions ==
[[File:Zealandia EEZs.tif|thumb|right|[[Exclusive economic zone]] of New Zealand and continental shelf boundaries for much of Zealandia]]

The total land area (including [[internal waters|inland water bodies]]) of Zealandia is {{convert|286655|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Of this, [[New Zealand]] comprises the majority, at {{convert|267988|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}}, or 93%) which includes the mainland, nearby islands, and most outlying islands including the [[Antipodes Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]], [[Bounty Islands]], [[Campbell Islands]], and [[Chatham Islands]] (but not the [[Kermadec Islands]] or [[Macquarie Island]] ([[Australia]]), which are part of the rift).

[[New Caledonia]] and the islands surrounding it comprise some {{convert|18576|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}} or 7%) and the remainder is made up of various [[States and territories of Australia|territories]] of [[Australia]] including [[Lord Howe Island]] Group ([[New South Wales]])  at {{convert|56|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}} or 0.02%), [[Norfolk Island]] at {{convert|35|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}} or 0.01%), as well as [[Elizabeth Reef|Elizabeth]] and [[Middleton Reef]]s ([[Coral Sea Islands]] Territory) with {{convert|0.25|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

== Population ==
The total human population of Zealandia today is about 5&amp;nbsp;million people.
