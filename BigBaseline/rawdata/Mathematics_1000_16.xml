'''A Mathematical Programming Language''' ('''AMPL''') is an [[algebraic modeling language]] to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing (i.e., large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems).&lt;ref name="ampl-book"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David Gay, and [[Brian Kernighan]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].
AMPL supports dozens of [[solver]]s, both [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[commercial software]], including CBC, [[CPLEX]], [[FortMP]], [[Gurobi]], [[MINOS (optimization software)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]], and LGO. Problems are passed to solvers as [[nl (format)|nl]] files.
AMPL is used by more than 100 corporate clients, and by government agencies and academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web
  | title=Position Available
  | url=http://www.ampl.com/OPENINGS/2011July.html#Product
  | accessdate=2011-07-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of AMPL is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of [[mathematical programming|optimization]]. Many modern solvers available on the [[NEOS Server]] (formerly hosted at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], currently hosted at the [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]&lt;ref name="neos-uwm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neos-guide.org/About/|title=About|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accept AMPL input. According to the NEOS statistics AMPL is the most popular format for representing mathematical programming problems.

==Features==
AMPL features a mix of [[declarative programming|declarative]] and [[imperative programming|imperative]] programming styles. Formulating optimization models occurs via declarative language elements such as sets, scalar and multidimensional parameters, decision variables, objectives and constraints, which allow for concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization.

Procedures and [[control flow]] statements are available in AMPL for
* the exchange of data with external data sources such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[XML]] and text files
* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models
* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available.

To support re-use and simplify construction of large-scale optimization problems, AMPL allows separation of model and data.

AMPL supports a wide range of problem types, among them:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without [[Convex function|convex]] quadratic constraints
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Second-order cone programming]]
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Semidefinite programming]] problems with [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] matrix inequalities
* [[Complementarity theory]] problems (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables
* [[Constraint programming]]&lt;ref name="cp-support"&gt;

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL invokes a solver in a separate process which has these advantages:
* User can interrupt the solution process at any time
* Solver errors do not affect the interpreter
* 32-bit version of AMPL can be used with a 64-bit solver and vice versa
Interaction with the solver is done through a well-defined [[nl (format)|nl interface]].

==Availability==
[[File:Neos-stats-2011-01.png|right|thumb|352px|[[Argonne National Laboratory#User facilities|NEOS]] input statistics for January 2011.]]
AMPL is available for many popular 32- and 64-bit [[operating system]]s including [[Linux]], Mac [[OS X]], some [[Unix]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ampl.com/products/ampl/ AMPL page at AMPL Optimization Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The translator is proprietary software maintained by AMPL Optimization LLC. However, several online services exist, providing free modeling and solving facilities using AMPL.&lt;ref name="neos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neos-server.org/neos/|title=NEOS Server for Optimization|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/TRYAMPL/|title=Try AMPL!|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A free student version with limited functionality and a free full-featured version for academic courses are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|title=AMPL Downloads|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526013237/http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|archive-date=26 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL can be used from within [[Microsoft Excel]] via the [[SolverStudio]] Excel add-in.

The AMPL Solver Library (ASL), which allows reading nl files and provides the automatic differentiation, is open-source. It is used in many solvers to implement AMPL connection.

A '''blockchain''',{{R|te20151031|fortune20160515|nyt20160521}} originally '''block chain''',{{R|primer|obmh}} is a growing list of [[Record (computer science)|records]], called ''blocks'', which are linked using [[cryptography]].&lt;ref name="te20151031" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Narayanan|first1= Arvind|last2= Bonneau|first2= Joseph|last3= Felten|first3= Edward|last4= Miller|first4= Andrew|last5= Goldfeder|first5= Steven|title= Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies: a comprehensive introduction|date= 2016|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= Princeton|isbn= 978-0-691-17169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each block contains a [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] of the previous block,&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt; a [[Trusted timestamping|timestamp]], and transaction data (generally represented as a [[merkle tree]] root hash).

By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, [[distributed ledger]] that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".&lt;ref name=hbr201701&gt;{{cite news |last= Iansiti |first= Marco |last2= Lakhani |first2= Karim R. |url= https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |title= The Truth About Blockchain |work= [[Harvard Business Review]] |publisher= [[Harvard University]] |date= January 2017 |accessdate =2017-01-17 |quote =The technology at the heart of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. |deadurl= no |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052537/https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |archivedate= 18 January 2017 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For use as a distributed [[ledger]], a blockchain is typically managed by a [[peer-to-peer]] network collectively adhering to a [[Protocol (communication)|protocol]] for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered [[secure by design]] and exemplify a distributed computing system with high [[Byzantine fault tolerance]]. [[Decentralized]] consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.&lt;ref name="decapp"&gt;{{cite book |title =Decentralized Applications: Harnessing Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology |last =Raval |first=Siraj |year =2016 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |oclc =968277125 |isbn =978-1-4919-2452-5 |chapter =What Is a Decentralized Application? |chapter-url ={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} |pages =[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} 1]–[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =2|plainurl =yes}} 2] |url ={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|plainurl =yes}} |accessdate =6 November 2016 |via =Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blockchain was invented by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008 to serve as the public transaction [[ledger]] of the [[cryptocurrency]] [[bitcoin]].{{R|te20151031}} The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the [[double-spending]] problem without the need of a trusted authority or central [[Server (computing)|server]].

== History ==
[[File:Confirmed Transactions Per Day.png|thumb|220x220px|Bitcoin transactions (January 2009 – September 2017)]]
The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haber|first1=Stuart|last2=Stornetta|first2=W. Scott|title=How to time-stamp a digital document|journal=Journal of Cryptology|date=January 1991|volume=3|issue=2|pages=99–111|doi=10.1007/bf00196791|citeseerx=10.1.1.46.8740}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated [[Merkle tree]]s to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bayer|first1=Dave|last2=Haber|first2=Stuart|last3=Stornetta|first3=W. Scott|title=Improving the Efficiency and Reliability of Digital Time-Stamping|journal=Sequences|date=March 1992|volume=2|pages=329–334|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-9323-8_24|isbn=978-1-4613-9325-2|citeseerx=10.1.1.71.4891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a [[Hashcash]]-like method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.{{r|cryptocurrencytech}} The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency [[bitcoin]], where it serves as the public [[ledger]] for all transactions on the network.{{R|te20151031}}

In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20&amp;nbsp;GB ([[gigabyte]]s).&lt;ref name="hadi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Digital Currency: Bitcoin, Innovation, Financial Instruments, and Big Data |editor-last=Chuen |editor-first=David LEE Kuo |year=2015 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-802351-8 |chapter=A Light Touch of Regulation for Virtual Currencies |last1=Nian |first1=Lam Pak |last2=Chuen |first2=David LEE Kuo |page=319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30&amp;nbsp;GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50&amp;nbsp;GB to 100&amp;nbsp;GB in size.

The words ''block'' and ''chain'' were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, ''blockchain,'' by 2016.  The term ''blockchain 2.0'' refers to new applications of the distributed blockchain database, first emerging in 2014.&lt;ref name="bc2.0"/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' described one implementation of this second-generation programmable blockchain as coming with "a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level."{{R|te20151031}}

{{asof|2016}}, blockchain 2.0 implementations continue to require an off-chain [[Oracle (computer science)|oracle]] to access any "external data or events based on time or market conditions [that need] to interact with the blockchain."&lt;ref name=bletchleyWP201609&gt;[https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md Project Bletchley Whitepaper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111135615/https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md |date=11 January 2017 }}, Microsoft, 2016-09-19.

IBM opened a blockchain innovation research center in Singapore in July 2016.&lt;ref name="ibmtof"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/ibm-to-open-first-blockchain-innovation-centre-in-singapore-to-create-applications |title=IBM to open first blockchain innovation centre in Singapore, to create applications and grow new markets in finance and trade |first=Ann |last=Williams |accessdate=13 November 2016 |date=12 July 2016 |newspaper=The Straits Times |publisher=Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

According to [[Accenture]], an application of the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the [[early adopter]]s phase.&lt;ref name="tfob"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |title=The future of blockchain in 8 charts |accessdate=3 December 2016 |date=27 June 2016 |work=Raconteur |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234125/http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |archivedate=2 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the [[Chamber of Digital Commerce]].

In May 2018, [[Gartner]] found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term ‘planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2018/05/04/hype-killer-only-1-of-companies-are-using-blockchain-gartner-reports/|title=Hype Killer - Only 1% of Companies Are Using Blockchain, Gartner Reports {{!}} Artificial Lawyer|date=2018-05-04|work=Artificial Lawyer|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

A blockchain is a [[Decentralized computing|decentralized]], [[Distributed computing|distributed]] and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved [[Storage_record|record]] cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.{{R|te20151031}}&lt;ref name="wired20161107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Armstrong |first=Stephen |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |title=Move over Bitcoin, the blockchain is only just getting started |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=7 November 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108130946/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |archivedate=8 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalini|first=Christian|last2=Gans|first2=Joshua S.|date=23 November 2016|title=Some Simple Economics of the Blockchain|ssrn=2874598|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2874598|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a [[peer-to-peer]] network and a distributed timestamping server. They are [[Authentication|authenticated]] by [[mass collaboration]] powered by [[collective]] [[self-interest]]s.&lt;ref name="hwb"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://fortune.com/2016/05/08/why-blockchains-will-change-the-world/ |first1=Don |last1=Tapscott |authorlink1=Don Tapscott |first2=Alex |last2=Tapscott |authorlink2=Alex Tapscott |title=Here's Why Blockchains Will Change the World |accessdate=16 November 2016 |date=8 May 2016 |magazine=Fortune |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113134748/http://fortune.com/2016/05/08/why-blockchains-will-change-the-world/ |archivedate=13 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a design facilitates [[robustness (computer science)|robust]] [[workflow]] where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite [[Reproduction (economics)|reproducibility]] from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of [[double spending]]. A blockchain has been described as a ''value-exchange protocol''.&lt;ref name="bc2.0"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |title=Block Chain 2.0: The Renaissance of Money |first=Kariappa |last=Bheemaiah |date=January 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2016 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114001509/https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.&lt;ref name="cbh"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techinasia.com/talk/blockchain-cards-payments-industry |title=Can blockchain help the cards and payments industry? |first=Michele |last=Tucci |accessdate=16 November 2016 |date=29 November 2015 |website=Tech in Asia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120304/https://www.techinasia.com/talk/blockchain-cards-payments-industry |archivedate=19 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A blockchain can maintain [[title (property)|title rights]] because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels [[offer and acceptance]].

===Blocks===
Blocks hold batches of valid [[Transaction processing|transactions]] that are hashed and encoded into a [[Merkle tree]].&lt;ref name="te20151031"/&gt; Each block includes the [[cryptographic hash]] of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.&lt;ref name=te20151031 /&gt; This [[Iteration|iterative]] process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt;

Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher value can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt; Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time.  They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks.  Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially&lt;ref name="bsm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |title=Bitcoin security model: trust by computation |first=Andreas |last=Antonopoulos |date=20 February 2014 |website=Radar |publisher=O'Reilly |accessdate=19 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031132328/http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |archivedate=31 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.{{R|te20151031}}{{r|t12|p=ch. 08}}{{r|paper}} For example, in a blockchain using the [[proof-of-work system]], the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is always considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of [[computation]]. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and [[Parallel computing|parallel]] manner.&lt;ref name="permbloc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://monax.io/explainers/permissioned_blockchains/ |title=Permissioned Blockchains |website=Explainer |publisher=Monax |accessdate=20 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120154948/https://monax.io/explainers/permissioned_blockchains/ |archivedate=20 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Block time====
The ''block time'' is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-does-Block-Time-mean-in-cryptocurrency|title=What does "Block Time" mean in cryptocurrency?|author=Muhammad Ghayas|website=[[Quora]]|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds.&lt;ref name="drd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-dragonchain-interoperable-ledger/ |title=Disney Reveals Dragonchain, an Interoperable Ledger |first=Jamie |last=Redman |accessdate=4 December 2016 |date=25 October 2016 |website=Bitcoin.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102001523/https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-dragonchain-interoperable-ledger/ |archivedate=2 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for [[Ethereum]] is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/why-is-ethereum-different-to-bitcoin/|title=Why is Ethereum different to Bitcoin?|author=Antonio Madeira|website=CryptoCompare|date=2018-01-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072118/https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/why-is-ethereum-different-to-bitcoin/|archivedate=22 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hard forks ====
{{Transcluded section|Fork (blockchain)}}
{{trim|{{#section-h:Fork (blockchain)|Hard fork}}}}

=== Decentralization ===
By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.{{R|te20151031}} The decentralized blockchain may use [[ad-hoc]] [[message passing]] and [[distributed networking]].

Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that [[Security hacker|computer crackers]] can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of [[failure]]. Blockchain security methods include the use of [[public-key cryptography]].{{r|primer|p=5}} A ''public key'' (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A ''private key'' is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.{{R|te20151031}}

Every [[Node (networking)|node]] in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. [[Data quality]] is maintained by massive database [[Replication (computing)|replication]]&lt;ref name="decapp"/&gt; and [[computational trust]]. No centralized "official" copy exists and no user is "trusted" more than any other.{{r|primer}} Transactions are broadcast to the network using software. Messages are delivered on a [[Best-effort delivery|best-effort]] basis. Mining nodes validate transactions,&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt; add them to the block they are building, and then [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]] the completed block to other nodes.{{R|t12|p=ch. 08}} Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as [[Proof-of-work system|proof-of-work]], to serialize changes.{{r|kopstein}} Alternative consensus methods include [[proof-of-stake]].&lt;ref name="hadc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Digital Currency: Bitcoin, Innovation, Financial Instruments, and Big Data |last=Bhaskar |first=Nirupama Devi |first2=David Lee Kuo |last2=Chuen |year=2015 |chapter=3 – Bitcoin Mining Technology |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-802117-0 |pages=47–51 |chapter-url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128021170000035 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128021170 |url-access=subscription |via=ScienceDirect |editor-first=David Lee Kuo |editor-last=Cheun |accessdate=2 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025155909/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128021170 |archivedate=25 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of [[Centrality|centralization]] because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gervais|first1=Arthur|last2=Karame|first2=Ghassan O.|last3=Capkun|first3=Vedran|last4=Capkun|first4=Srdjan|title=Is Bitcoin a Decentralized Currency?|url=https://www.infoq.com/articles/is-bitcoin-a-decentralized-currency/|accessdate=11 October 2016|website=InfoQ|publisher=InfoQ &amp; IEEE computer society|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010042659/https://www.infoq.com/articles/is-bitcoin-a-decentralized-currency/|archivedate=10 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Openness ===
Open blockchains are more [[usability|user-friendly]] than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.{{R|t16|t10|t11|t8|t9}} Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC) in databases.{{R|t4}} Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.&lt;ref name="tapscott201605" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.{{R|t16|t11}} Nikolai Hampton of ''[[Computerworld]]'' said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarTech"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barry |first1=Levine |title=A new report bursts the blockchain bubble |url=https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959 |accessdate=13 July 2018 |publisher=MarTech |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Permissionless ====
The great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no [[access control]] is needed.&lt;ref name="bsm"/&gt; This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a [[transport layer]].&lt;ref name="bsm"/&gt;

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses [[Hashcash]] puzzles.  While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by [[Adam Back]], the original idea was first proposed by [[Cynthia Dwork]] and [[Moni Naor]] and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

In 2016, [[venture capital]] investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.&lt;ref name="btt17"/&gt; Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. {{asof|2018|04}}, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.

==== Permissioned (private) blockchain ====

Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.&lt;ref name="btit"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://au.pcmag.com/amazon-web-services/46389/feature/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-world |title=Blockchain: The Invisible Technology That's Changing the World |author=Bob Marvin |accessdate=25 September 2017 |date=30 August 2017 |newspaper=PC MAG Australia |publisher=ZiffDavis, LLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925180800/http://au.pcmag.com/amazon-web-services/46389/feature/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-world |archivedate=25 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted in both 2016 and 2017 that many corporations are using blockchain networks "with private blockchains, independent of the public system."&lt;ref name=nyt20160327/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/ethereum-alliance-business-banking-security.html|title=Business Giants to Announce Creation of a Computing System Based on Ethereum|first=Nathaniel|last=Popper|date=27 February 2017|via=''The New York Times''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620134100/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/ethereum-alliance-business-banking-security.html|archivedate=20 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=this claim does not seem to make sense knowing that Ethereum blockchain is public, not private|date=September 2017}}

==== Disadvantages of private blockchain====
Nikolai Hampton pointed out in ''[[Computerworld]]'' that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt; This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a [[financial crisis]] or [[debt crisis]] like the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,&lt;ref name="SalsmanTheFinancial13"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardsalsman/2013/09/19/the-financial-crisis-was-a-failure-of-government-not-free-markets/ |title=The Financial Crisis Was A Failure Of Government, Not Free Markets |author=Salsman, R.M. |website=Forbes |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeeffeThePolitical15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bruegel.org/2015/07/the-political-economy-of-financial-crisis-policy/ |title=The political economy of financial crisis policy |author=O'Keeffe, M.; Terzi, A. |website=Bruegel |date=7 July 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power—it's time consuming and expensive."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt; He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases."&lt;ref name=cw20160905&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hampton |first=Nikolai |url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/606253/understanding-blockchain-hype-why-much-it-nothing-more-than-snake-oil-spin/ |title=Understanding the blockchain hype: Why much of it is nothing more than snake oil and spin |magazine=[[Computerworld]] |date=5 September 2016 |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906171838/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/606253/understanding-blockchain-hype-why-much-it-nothing-more-than-snake-oil-spin/ |archivedate=6 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains today is as a [[distributed ledger]] for [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]], most notably [[bitcoin]]. There are a few operational products maturing from [[proof of concept]] by late 2016.&lt;ref name="btt17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/blockchain-top-trends-in-2017 |title=Blockchain Top Trends In 2017 |first=James |last=Ovenden |publisher=The Innovation Enterprise |accessdate=4 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130143727/https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/blockchain-top-trends-in-2017 |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, some observers remain skeptical. Steve Wilson, of Constellation Research, believes the technology has been [[media circus|hyped]] with unrealistic claims.&lt;ref name="almeve"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/blockchain-almost-everything-you-read-wrong |title=Blockchain: Almost Everything You Read Is Wrong |first=Steve |last=Wilson |date=3 May 2016 |publisher=Constellation Research Inc. |accessdate=13 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114002256/https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/blockchain-almost-everything-you-read-wrong |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To mitigate [[risk management|risk]], businesses are reluctant to place blockchain at the core of the business structure.&lt;ref name="clsdips"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/c905b6fc-4dd2-3170-9d2a-c79cdbb24f16 |title=CLS dips into blockchain to net new currencies |author=Katie Martin |accessdate=7 November 2016 |date=27 September 2016 |newspaper=Financial Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109152317/https://www.ft.com/content/c905b6fc-4dd2-3170-9d2a-c79cdbb24f16 |archivedate=9 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryptocurrencies ===
{{main|Cryptocurrency}}
Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the [[bitcoin network]] and [[Ethereum]] network are blockchain-based. On May 8, 2018 [[Facebook]] confirmed that it is opening a new blockchain group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wagner |first1=Kurt |title=Facebook is making its biggest executive shuffle in company history |url=https://www.recode.net/2018/5/8/17330226/facebook-reorg-mark-zuckerberg-whatsapp-messenger-ceo-blockchain |website=Recode |accessdate=25 September 2018 |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will be headed by [[David A. Marcus|David Marcus]] who previously was in charge of [[Facebook Messenger|Messenger]]. According to [[The Verge]] Facebook is planning to launch its own [[cryptocurrency]] for facilitating payments on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gartenberg |first1=Chaim |title=Facebook reportedly plans to launch its own cryptocurrency |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/11/17344318/facebook-cryptocurrency-token-blockchain-report-david-marcus |website=The Verge |accessdate=25 September 2018 |date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart contracts ===
{{main|Smart contract}}
Blockchain-based [[smart contract]]s are proposed contracts that could be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.&lt;ref name="unbi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Bitcoin: Cryptography, Engineering and Economics |last=Franco |first=Pedro |year=2014 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-119-01916-9 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHfCBwAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=4 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214204859/https://books.google.com/books?id=YHfCBwAAQBAJ |archivedate=14 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main objectives of a smart contract is [[automation|automated]] [[escrow]]. An [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce [[moral hazard]]s and optimize the use of contracts in general. But "no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged." Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status is unclear.&lt;ref name="vcab"&gt;{{cite book | title = Virtual Currencies and Beyond: Initial Considerations | series = IMF Discussion Note | year = 2016 | publisher = International Monetary Fund | isbn = 978-1-5135-5297-2 | page = 23 | url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1603.pdf | accessdate = 2018-04-19 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180414210721/https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1603.pdf | archivedate = 2018-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptokitties also demonstrated how blockchains can be used to catalog game assets ([[digital asset]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|title=CryptoKitties craze slows down transactions on Ethereum|date=2017-05-12|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112143517/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|archivedate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the video game industry, while blockchain use is seen as part of a marketplace mechanism, such as with [[Robot Cache]], blockchain is also postulated as a way to share video game assets between various games. The Blockchain Game Alliance was formed in September 2018 to explore alternative uses of blockchains in video gaming with support of [[Ubisoft]] and [[Fig (company)|Fig]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/leading-blockchain-and-gaming-companies-form-blockchain-game-alliance/ | title=  Leading Blockchain and Gaming Companies Form Blockchain Game Alliance | first = Jimmy | last = Aki | date = September 27, 2018 | accessdate = October 21, 2018 | work = [[Bitcoin Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of blockchains==
Currently, there are three types of blockchain networks - public blockchains, private blockchains and [[consortium]] blockchains.

===Public blockchains===
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an [[internet]] connection can send [[Financial transaction|transactions]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2018}} to it as well as become a [[validator]] (i.e., participate in the execution of a [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus protocol]]).&lt;ref name=Perfectial&gt;{{cite web|title= How Companies Can Leverage Private Blockchains to Improve Efficiency and Streamline Business Processes|url=https://perfectial.com/blog/leveraging-private-blockchains-improve-efficiency-streamline-business-processes/|website=Perfectial}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=April 2018}} Usually, such networks offer [[Incentive|economic incentives]] for those who secure them and utilize some type of a [[Proof-of-stake|Proof of Stake]] or [[Proof-of-work system|Proof of Work]] algorithm.

Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

===Private blockchains===
A private blockchain is permissioned.&lt;ref name="btit"/&gt; One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted.

This type of blockchains can be considered a middle-ground for companies that are interested in the blockchain technology in general but are not comfortable with a level of control offered by public networks. Typically, they seek to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]] blockchain into their accounting and record-keeping procedures without sacrificing autonomy and running the risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.

===Consortium blockchains===
A consortium blockchain is often said to be semi-decentralized. It, too, is permissioned but instead of a single [[organization]] controlling it, a number of companies might each operate a [[Node (networking)|node]] on such a network. The administrators of a consortium chain restrict users' reading rights as they see fit and only allow a limited set of trusted nodes to execute a consensus protocol.

[[File:BlockchainPanelDiscussionAtIEEETechIgnite2017.jpg|thumb|Blockchain panel discussion at the first [[IEEE Computer Society]] TechIgnite conference]]

In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalini|first=Christian|last2=Tucker|first2=Catherine E.|date=11 August 2016|title=Seeding the S-Curve?

The (standard) '''Boolean model of information retrieval (BIR)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=Lancaster, F.W. | author2=Fayen, E.G. | title=Information Retrieval On-Line | publisher=Melville Publishing Co., Los Angeles, California | year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a classical [[information retrieval]] (IR) model and, at the same time, the first and most-adopted one. It is used by many IR systems to this day.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The BIR is based on [[Boolean logic]] and classical [[set theory]] in that both the documents to be searched and the user's query are conceived as sets of terms. Retrieval is based on whether or not the documents contain the query terms. 

==Definitions==

An ''index term'' is a word or expression'','' which may be [[stemming|stemmed]], describing or characterizing a document,  such as a keyword given for a journal article. Let&lt;math display="block"&gt;T = \{t_1, t_2,\ \ldots,\ t_m\}&lt;/math&gt;be the set of all such index terms. 

A ''document'' is any subset of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Let&lt;math display="block"&gt;D = \{D_1,\ \ldots\ ,D_n\}&lt;/math&gt;be the set of all documents. 

A ''query'' is a Boolean expression &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; in normal form:&lt;math display="block"&gt;Q = (W_1\ \or\ W_2\ \or\ \cdots) \and\ \cdots\ \and\ (W_i\ \or\ W_{i+1}\ \or\ \cdots)&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; is true for &lt;math&gt;D_j&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;t_i \in D_j&lt;/math&gt;. (Equivalently, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; could be expressed in  [[disjunctive normal form]].)

We seek to find the set of documents that satisfy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  This operation is called ''retrieval'' and consists of the following two steps:

: 1. For each &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W_j&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, find the set &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt; of documents that satisfy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W_j&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math display="block"&gt;S_j = \{D_i\mid W_j\}&lt;/math&gt;2. Then the set of documents that satisfy Q is given by:&lt;math display="block"&gt;(S_1 \cup S_2 \cup \cdots) \cap \cdots \cap (S_i \cup S_{i+1} \cup \cdots)&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

Let the set of original (real) documents be, for example

: &lt;math&gt;O = \{O_1,\ O_2,\ O_3\}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; = "Bayes' principle: The principle that, in estimating a parameter, one should initially assume that each possible value has equal probability (a uniform prior  distribution)."

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; = "[[Bayes' theorem|Bayesian decision theory]]: A mathematical theory of decision-making which presumes utility and probability functions, and according to which the act to be chosen is the Bayes act, i.e. the one with highest subjective expected utility. If one had unlimited time and calculating power with which to make every decision, this procedure would be the best way to make any decision."

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;O_3&lt;/math&gt; = "Bayesian [[epistemology]]: A philosophical theory which holds that the epistemic status of a proposition (i.e. how well proven or well established it is) is best measured by a probability and that the proper way to revise this probability is given by Bayesian conditionalisation or similar procedures. A Bayesian epistemologist would use probability to define, and explore the relationship between, concepts such as epistemic status, support or explanatory power."

Let the set &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of terms be:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;T = \{t_1=\text{Bayes' principle}, t_2=\text{probability}, t_3=\text{decision-making}, t_4=\text{Bayesian epistemology}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the set &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of documents is as follows:

: &lt;math display="block"&gt;D = \{D_1,\ D_2,\ D_3\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
D_1 &amp;= \{\text{probability},\ \text{Bayes' principle}\} \\
D_2 &amp;= \{\text{probability},\ \text{decision-making}\} \\
D_3 &amp;= \{\text{probability},\ \text{Bayesian epistemology}\}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let the query &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;Q = \text{probability} \and \text{decision-making}&lt;/math&gt;Then to retrieve the relevant documents:
# Firstly, the following sets &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; of documents &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt;  are obtained (retrieved):&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
S_1 &amp;= \{D_1,\ D_2,\ D_3\} \\
S_2 &amp;= \{D_2\}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
# Finally, the following documents &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; are retrieved in response to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math display="block"&gt;Q: \{D_1,\ D_2,\ D_3\}\ \cap\ \{D_2\}\ =\ \{D_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
This means that the original document &lt;math display="inline"&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D_2&lt;/math&gt;) is the answer to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Obviously, if there is more than one document with the same representation, every such document is retrieved. Such documents are indistinguishable in the BIR (in other words, equivalent).

== Advantages ==

* Clean formalism
* Easy to implement
* Intuitive concept

== Disadvantages ==

* [[String search algorithm|Exact matching]] may retrieve too few or too many documents
* Hard to translate a query into a Boolean expression
* All terms are equally weighted
* More like ''[[data retrieval]]'' than ''information retrieval''

== Data structures and algorithms ==

From a pure formal mathematical point of view, the BIR is straightforward. From a practical point of view, however, several further problems should be solved that relate to algorithms and data structures, such as, for example, the choice of terms (manual or automatic selection or both), [[stemming]], [[hash table]]s, [[Inverted index|inverted file]] structure, and so on.&lt;ref name="wartik"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wartik | first = Steven | title = Information Retrieval Data Structures &amp; Algorithms | chapter = Boolean operations | publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc. | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-13-463837-9 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13742235/Information-Retrieval-Data-Structures-Algorithms-William-B-Frakes | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928060217/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13742235/Information-Retrieval-Data-Structures-Algorithms-William-B-Frakes | archivedate = 2013-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hash sets ===

Another possibility is to use [[hash set]]s. Each document is represented by a hash table which contains every single term of that document. Since hash table size increases and decreases in real time with the addition and removal of terms, each document will occupy much less space in memory. However, it will have a slowdown in performance because the operations are more complex than with [[bit vector]]s. On the worst-case performance can degrade from O(''n'') to O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). On the average case, the performance slowdown will not be that much worse than bit vectors and the space usage is much more efficient.

An '''electronic calculator''' is typically a portable [[Electronics|electronic]] device used to perform [[calculation]]s, ranging from basic [[arithmetic]] to complex [[mathematics]].

The first [[Solid-state electronics|solid-state electronic]] calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the [[Intel 4004]], the first [[microprocessor]], was developed by [[Intel]] for the Japanese calculator company [[Busicom]]. They later became used commonly within the [[petroleum industry]] (oil and gas).

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, [[ISO/IEC 7810|credit-card-sized]] models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of [[integrated circuit]]s reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

Computer [[operating system]]s as far back as [[Ancient UNIX|early Unix]] have included interactive calculator [[Computer program|programs]] such as [[dc (computer program)|dc]] and [[hoc (programming language)|hoc]], and calculator functions are included in almost all [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.

In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are [[scientific calculator]]s which include [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] and [[statistics|statistical]] calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do [[computer algebra]]. [[Graphing calculator]]s can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. {{As of|2016}}, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.

In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. By 2007, this diminished to less than 0.05%.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727161911/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 |date=2013-07-27 }}, Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60–65; see also [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html "free access to the study"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414233810/http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html/ |date=2016-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:CalculatorFractions-5550x.jpg|thumb|Scientific calculator displays of fractions and decimal equivalents]]

===Input===
[[Electronics|Electronic]] calculators contain a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] with [[Push-button|buttons]] for [[Numerical digit|digit]]s and [[arithmetic]]al operations; some even contain "00" and "000" buttons to make larger or smaller [[number]]s easier to enter. Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button; however, in more specific calculators, a button can perform multi-function working with [[key combination]]s.

===Display output===
Calculators usually have [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCD) as output in place of historical [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) displays and [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFD); details are provided in the section ''[[#Technical improvements|Technical improvements]]''.

Large-sized [[Number|figures]] are often used to improve readability; while using [[decimal separator]] (usually a point rather than a [[comma]]) instead of or in addition to [[vulgar fraction]]s. Various symbols for [[Command (computing)|function commands]] may also be shown on the display. [[Fraction (mathematics)|Fractions]] such as {{math|{{frac|1|3}}}} are displayed as decimal [[approximation]]s, for example rounded to {{math|0.33333333}}. Also, some fractions (such as {{math|{{frac|1|7}}}}, which is {{math|0.14285714285714}}; to 14 [[significant figures]]) can be difficult to recognize in [[decimal]] form; as a result, many [[Scientific calculator|scientific]] calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or [[mixed number]]s.

===Memory===
Calculators also have the ability to store numbers into [[computer memory]]. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s. The variables can also be used for constructing [[formula]]s. Some models have the ability to extend [[Computer memory|memory]] capacity to store more numbers; the extended [[memory address]] is termed an [[array data structure|array]] index.

===Power source===
Power sources of calculators are: [[electric battery|batteries]], [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|solar cells]] or [[mains electricity]] (for old models), turning on with a [[switch]] or button. Some models even have no turn-off button but they provide some way to put off (for example, leaving no operation for a moment, covering [[solar cell]] exposure, or closing their [[lid]]). [[Crank (mechanism)|Crank]]-powered calculators were also common in the early computer era.

===Key layout===
The following keys are common to most pocket calculators.  While the arrangement of the digits is standard, the positions of other keys vary from model to model; the illustration is an example.

==Internal workings==
In general, a basic [[Electronics|electronic]] calculator consists of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis, ''The Pocket Calculator Book''. (London: Usborne, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Power source ([[mains electricity]], [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and/or [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|solar cell]])
* [[Keypad]] (input device) – consists of keys used to input numbers and function commands ([[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[Square root|square-root]], etc.)
* Display panel (output device) – displays input numbers, commands and results. [[Liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFDs), and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) displays use [[Seven-segment display|seven segments]] to represent each [[Numerical digit|digit]] in a basic calculator. Advanced calculators may use [[dot matrix]] displays.
** A printing calculator, in addition to a display panel, has a printing unit that prints results in ink onto a roll of paper, using a printing mechanism.
* Processor [[Chipset|chip]] ([[microprocessor]] or [[central processing unit]]).

[[Clock rate]] of a processor [[Chipset|chip]] refers to the frequency at which the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) is running. It is used as an indicator of the processor's speed, and is measured in ''clock cycles per second'' or the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit [[Hertz|hertz (Hz)]]. For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred [[hertz]] to the [[kilohertz]] range.

===Example===
A basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four-function calculator:

To perform the calculation {{nowrap|25 + 9}}, one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators: {{key press|2}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|5}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|+}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|9}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|{{=}}}}.

:* When {{key press|2}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|5}} is entered, it is picked up by the scanning unit; the number 25 is encoded and sent to the X register;
:* Next, when the {{key press|+}} key is pressed, the "[[addition]]" instruction is also encoded and sent to the flag or [[status register]];
:* The second number {{Key press|9}} is encoded and sent to the X register. This "pushes" (shifts) the first number out into the Y register;
:* When the {{key press|{{=}}}} key is pressed, a "message" (signal) from the flag or [[status register]] tells the permanent or [[non-volatile memory]] that the operation to be done is "[[addition]]";
:* The numbers in the X and Y registers are then loaded into the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the permanent or non-volatile memory;
:* The answer, 34 is sent (shifted) back to the X register. From there, it is converted by the [[binary decoder]] unit into a decimal number (usually [[binary-coded decimal]]), and then shown on the display panel.

Other functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions.

====Numeric representation====
{{Main|Binary-coded decimal}}

Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD rather than a [[floating-point representation]].  BCD is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary.

The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235832/http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where calculators have added functions (such as square root, or [[trigonometric functions]]), software [[algorithm]]s are required to produce high precision results. Sometimes significant design effort is needed to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator [[Chipset|chip]], with acceptable calculation time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/72jun/jun72a2.pdf |title=David S.

==Calculators compared to computers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
The fundamental difference between a calculator and [[computer]] is that a computer can be [[Computer programming|programmed]] in a way that allows the [[Computer program|program]] to take different [[Branch on condition|branches according to intermediate results]], while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions (such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[logarithm]]s) built in. The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as [[programmable calculator]]s have [[Computer programming|programming]] functions, sometimes with support for [[programming language]]s (such as [[RPL (programming language)|RPL]] or [[TI-BASIC]]).

For instance, instead of a hardware multiplier, a calculator might implement [[floating point]] mathematics with code in [[read-only memory]] (ROM), and compute [[trigonometric function]]s with the [[CORDIC]] algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication. [[Serial communication|Bit serial]] logic designs are more common in calculators whereas [[Parallel communication|bit parallel]] designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes [[chipset|chip]] complexity, but takes many more [[clock signal|clock cycles]]. This distinction blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, more so the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]], [[Motorola 68000|MC68000]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] architectures, and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market.

==History==

===Precursors to the electronic calculator===
{{Main|Mechanical calculator}}
{{See also|Human computer}}

The first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were: bones (used to tally items), pebbles, and [[counting board]]s, and the [[abacus]], known to have been used by [[Sumer]]ians and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] before 2000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (an "out of the time" [[Astronomy|astronomical]] device), development of computing tools arrived near the start of the 17th century: the [[Sector (instrument)|geometric-military compass]] (by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]), [[logarithm]]s and [[Napier bones]] (by [[John Napier|Napier]]), and the [[slide rule]] (by [[Edmund Gunter]]).

[[File:17th-century-mechanical-calculators.jpg|thumb|17th century mechanical calculators]]
In 1642, the [[Renaissance]] saw the invention of the [[mechanical calculator]] (by [[Wilhelm Schickard]]&lt;ref&gt;See for example, http://calculatorhistory.net&lt;/ref&gt; and several decades later [[Blaise Pascal]]&lt;ref&gt;Pascal's invention of the [[calculating machine]]. Pascal invented his machine just four hundred years ago, as a youth of nineteen. He was spurred to it by sharing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen. He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose ; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life. But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use. Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions....&lt;br&gt;
In a sense, Pascal's invention was premature, in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use. This difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal. [[#NAT CHAP|S. Chapman, Magazine Nature]], pp.508,509 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;), a device that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all four [[arithmetic]] operations with minimal human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;"Pascal and Leibnitz, in the seventeenth century, and Diderot at a later period, endeavored to construct a machine which might serve as a substitute for human intelligence in the combination of figures" [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf0IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=arithmometer&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=arithmometer The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 202, p.100] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106145057/https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf0IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=arithmometer&amp;as_brr=1 |date=2017-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal's calculator]] could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition. Schickard's machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation. (Because they were different inventions with different aims a debate about whether Pascal or Schickard should be credited as the "inventor" of the adding machine (or calculating machine) is probably pointless.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SchicardvsPascal Pascal vs Schickard: An empty debate?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408215848/http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SchicardvsPascal |date=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Schickard and Pascal were followed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, the [[stepped reckoner]], inventing in the process his [[leibniz wheel]], but who couldn't design a fully operational machine.&lt;ref&gt;In 1893, the German calculating machine inventor Arthur Burkhardt was asked to put Leibniz machine in operating condition if possible. His report was favorable except for the sequence in the carry {{cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Jekuthiel|title=Scripta Mathematica|year=1933|publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC|isbn=978-0-7661-3835-3|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Mechanical calculator#Calculating clocks: unsuccessful mechanical calculators]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grant mechanical calculating machine 1877.jpg|thumb|left|The Grant mechanical calculating machine, 1877]]
The 18th century saw the arrival of some notable improvements, first by [[Giovanni Poleni|Poleni]] with the first fully functional calculating clock and four-operation machine, but these machines were almost always ''one of the kind''. [[Luigi Torchi (inventor)|Luigi Torchi]] invented the first direct multiplication machine in 1834: this was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White (1822).&lt;ref&gt;Denis Roegel: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=7763737 ''Before Torchi and Schwilgué, There Was White.''] In: ''IEEE Annals of the History of Computing,'' October–December 2016, pp. 92-93. Retrieved 2018-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 19th century and the [[Industrial Revolution]] that real developments began to occur. Although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the 19th century, the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible. The [[Arithmometer]], invented in 1820 as a four-operation mechanical calculator, was released to production in 1851 as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit; forty years later, by 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html |title=(retrieved on 01/02/2012) |language=fr |publisher=Arithmometre.org |date= |access-date=2013-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521075617/http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883) and Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 [[comptometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felt|first=Dorr E.|title=Mechanical arithmetic, or The history of the counting machine|publisher=Washington Institute|location=Chicago|page=4|year=1916|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703013921/https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich|archivedate=2016-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Clarke_1.pdf|thumb|right|Patent image of the Clarke graph-based calculator, 1921]]
It wasn't until 1902 that the familiar push-button user interface was developed, with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine, developed by James L. Dalton in the [[United States]].

In 1921, [[Edith Clarke]] invented the "Clarke calculator", a simple graph-based calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions. This allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] in [[power transmission lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lott|first1=Melissa C.|title=The Engineer Who Foreshadowed the Smart Grid--in 1921|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/the-engineer-who-foreshadowed-the-smart-grid-in-1921/|website=Plugged In|publisher=Scientific American Blog Network|accessdate=14 August 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814232626/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/the-engineer-who-foreshadowed-the-smart-grid-in-1921/|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Curta]] calculator was developed in 1948 and, although costly, became popular for its portability. This purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.

===Development of electronic calculators===
The first [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers, using firstly [[vacuum tube]]s and later [[transistor]]s in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. This technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators.

The [[Casio]] Computer Company, in [[Japan]], released the Model ''14-A'' calculator in 1957, which was the world's first all-electric (relatively) compact calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on [[relay]] technology, and was built into a desk.
[[File:LED DISP.JPG|thumb|Early calculator [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) display from the 1970s ([[USSR]])]]

In October 1961, the world's first ''all-electronic desktop'' calculator, the British [[Bell Punch]]/Sumlock Comptometer [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] ('''A''' '''N'''ew '''I'''nspiration '''T'''o '''A'''rithmetic/'''A'''ccounting) was announced.&lt;ref&gt;"Simple and Silent", ''Office Magazine'', December 1961, p1244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Anita' der erste tragbare elektonische Rechenautomat" [trans: "the first portable electronic computer"], ''Büromaschinen Mechaniker'', November 1961, p207&lt;/ref&gt; This machine used [[vacuum tube]]s, cold-cathode tubes and [[Dekatron]]s in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [[Nixie tube|"Nixie"]] tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical [[comptometer]]s of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly {{convert|33|lb|kg}} due to its large tube system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ball|first1=Guy|last2=Flamm|first2=Bruce|title=The History of Pocket Electronic Calculators|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/history_of_electronic_calculat.html|website=vintagecalculators.com|publisher=[[Vintage Calculators Web Museum]]|access-date=8 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703140814/http://vintagecalculators.com/html/history_of_electronic_calculat.html|archivedate=3 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names "Plus" and "Sumlock", and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British [[Pilot ACE]] computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.

The tube technology of the ANITA was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), and introduced [[Reverse Polish Notation]] (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the [[CS-10A]], which weighed {{convert|25|kg|lb}} and cost 500,000 yen (${{To USD|500000|JPN}}), and [[Industria Macchine Elettroniche]] of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time).

[[File:Olivetti Programma 101 - Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|The Italian [[Programma 101]], the first commercial programmable desktop computer, produced by [[Olivetti]] in 1964]]

There followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Mathatronics]], [[Olivetti]], [[SCM Corporation|SCM]] (Smith-Corona-Marchant), [[Sony]], [[Toshiba]], and [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]]. The early calculators used hundreds of [[Bipolar junction transistor#Germanium transistors|germanium transistors]], which were cheaper than [[Transistor#Semiconductor material|silicon transistor]]s, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], cold-cathode [[Nixie tube]]s, and [[filament lamp]]s. Memory technology was usually based on the [[delay line memory]] or the [[magnetic core memory]], though the Toshiba "Toscal" BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of [[dynamic RAM]] built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.

The [[Olivetti]] [[Programma 101]] was introduced in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop '''electronic calculating machine''' programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The Olivetti Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.

The ''[[Monroe Epic]]'' programmable calculator came on the market in 1967. A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only ''branch'' instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any [[conditional branch]] (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.

===1970s to mid-1980s===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Casio as-a ckt1 1c.jpg|thumb|Internal circuit with twelve Nixie tube display elements inside a 1960s desktop calculator]] --&gt;
The electronic calculators of the mid-1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of [[transistor]]s on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply. There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer [[integrated circuit]]s (chips) and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of [[semiconductor]] development. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in [[Integrated circuit#SSI, MSI and LSI|large scale integration]] (LSI) semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] with [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hayakawa Electric]] (later renamed [[Sharp Corporation]]) with North-American Rockwell Microelectronics (later renamed [[Rockwell International]]), [[Busicom]] with [[Mostek]] and [[Intel]], and [[General Instrument]] with [[Sanyo]].

====Pocket calculators====
{{Redirect|Pocket calculator|the song|Computer World}}

By 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption, allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries. The first portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the [[Sanyo]] ICC-0081 "Mini Calculator", the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] Pocketronic, and the [[Sharp QT-8B]] "micro Compet". The Canon Pocketronic was a development of the "Cal-Tech" project which had been started at [[Texas Instruments]] in 1965 as a research project to produce a portable calculator. The Pocketronic has no traditional display; numerical output is on thermal paper tape. As a result of the "Cal-Tech" project, Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.

Sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January 1971 the [[Sharp EL-8]], also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a pocket calculator. It weighed 1.59 pounds (721 grams), had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable [[NiCad]] batteries, and initially sold for US $395.

However, the efforts in [[integrated circuit development]] culminated in the introduction in early 1971 of the first "calculator on a chip", the MK6010 by [[Mostek]],&lt;ref&gt;"Single Chip Calculator Hits the Finish Line", ''Electronics'', February 1, 1971, p19&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very costly, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology (such as the [[vacuum fluorescent display]], [[Light-emitting diode|LED]], and [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]), led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all.

In 1971 [[Pico Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro |title=Microprocessor History |publisher=Spingal.plus.com |date= |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720142104/http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro/ |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Instrument]] also introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a full single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator. Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market.

The first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the [[Busicom]] LE-120A "HANDY", which was marketed early in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"The one-chip calculator is here, and it's only the beginning", Electronic Design, February 18, 1971, p34.&lt;/ref&gt; Made in Japan, this was also the first calculator to use an LED display, the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit (then proclaimed as a "calculator on a chip"), the [[Mostek]] MK6010, and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries. Using four AA-size cells the LE-120A measures {{convert|4.9 x 2.8 x 0.9|in|mm}}.

The first European-made pocket-sized calculator, DB 800&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epocalc.net/pages/calc_premieres|title=epocalc - Calculators|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028020141/http://www.epocalc.net/pages/calc_premieres|archivedate=28 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/40--rodendan-digitrona--u-bujama-je-izraden-prvi-europski-dzepni-kalkulator--te-1971-kostao-je-koliko-i-fico/954368/|title=U Bujama je izrađen prvi europski džepni kalkulator.

The first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B (popularly termed ''The Bowmar Brain''), measuring {{convert|5.2 x 3.0 x 1.5|in|mm}}, came out in the Autumn of 1971, with four functions and an eight-digit red [[light-emitting diode|LED]] display, for $240, while in August 1972 the four-function [[Sinclair Executive]] became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring {{convert|5.4 x 2.2 x 0.35|in|mm}} and weighing {{convert|2.5|oz|g}}. It retailed for around £79 (${{To USD|79|GBR}}). By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than £5 (${{To USD|5|GBR}}).

The first [[Soviet Union]] made pocket-sized calculator, the ''Elektronika B3-04'' was developed by the end of 1973 and sold at the start of 1974.

One of the first low-cost calculators was the [[Sinclair Cambridge]], launched in August 1973. It retailed for £29.95 (${{To USD|29.95|GBR}}), or £5 (${{To USD|5|GBR}}) less in kit form. The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of [[transcendental function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://righto.com/sinclair Reversing Sinclair's amazing 1974 calculator hack – half the ROM of the HP-35], Ken Shirriff, 2013.

Meanwhile, [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) had been developing a pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972, it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with ''scientific'' functions that could replace a [[slide rule]]. The $395 [[HP-35]], along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like "8 plus 5" is, using RPN, performed by pressing {{key top|8}}, {{key top|Enter↑}}, {{key top|5}}, and {{key top|+}}; instead of the algebraic [[infix notation]]: {{key top|8}}, {{key top|+}}, {{key top|5}}, {{key top|{{=}}}}. It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.

The first Soviet ''scientific'' pocket-sized calculator the "B3-18" was completed by the end of 1975.

In 1973, [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) introduced the [[TI SR-10|SR-10]], (''SR'' signifying [[slide rule]]) an ''algebraic entry'' pocket calculator using [[scientific notation]] for $150. Shortly after the [[TI SR-11|SR-11]] featured an added key for entering [[Pi]] (π). It was followed the next year by the [[TI SR-50|SR-50]] which added log and trig functions to compete with the HP-35, and in 1977 the mass-marketed [[TI-30]] line which is still produced.

In 1978 a new company, [[Calculated Industries]] arose which focused on specialized markets. Their first calculator, the Loan Arranger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm |title=The Loan Arranger II |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719134735/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1978) was a pocket calculator marketed to the Real Estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values. In 1985, CI launched a calculator for the construction industry called the Construction Master&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/CM.htm |title=Construction Master |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135006/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/CM.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations (such as angles, stairs, roofing math, pitch, rise, run, and feet-inch fraction conversions). This would be the first in a line of construction related calculators.

====Programmable calculators====
{{Main|Programmable calculator}}
[[File:HP 65.jpg|thumb|The [[HP-65]], the first programmable pocket calculator (1974)]]
The first desktop ''programmable calculators'' were produced in the mid-1960s by [[Mathatronics]] and [[Casio]] (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the [[HP-65]], in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the [[HP-25C]] introduced ''[[continuous memory]]'', i.e., programs and data were retained in [[CMOS]] memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first ''[[alphanumeric]]'', programmable, ''expandable'' calculator, the [[HP-41]]C. It could be expanded with [[random access memory]] (RAM, for memory) and [[read-only memory]] (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like [[bar code]] readers, [[microcassette]] and [[floppy disk]] drives, paper-roll [[thermal printer]]s, and miscellaneous communication interfaces ([[RS-232]], [[HP-IL]], [[HP-IB]]).

The first Soviet programmable desktop calculator [[ISKRA 123]], powered by the power grid, was released at the start of the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, [[Elektronika]] ''[[B3-21]]'', was developed by the end of 1976 and released at the start of 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://electronika-5.ru/calc/doc/B3-21_pas.rar |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051719/http://electronika-5.ru/calc/doc/B3-21_pas.rar |archive-date=2017-12-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The successor of B3-21, the [[Elektronika B3-34]] wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including [[adventure game]]s and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The [[Elektronika MK-52]] calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal [[EEPROM]] memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for [[Soyuz TM-7]] flight) as a backup of the board computer.

This series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features, somewhat similar to "[[synthetic programming]]" of the American [[HP-41]], which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages, jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods. A number of respected monthly publications, including the popular science magazine ''[[Nauka i Zhizn]]'' (''Наука и жизнь'', ''Science and Life''), featured special columns, dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers, which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches, named "[[yeggogology]]" ("еггогология"). The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word "YEGGOG" ("ЕГГОГ") which, unsurprisingly, is translated to "Error".

A similar hacker culture in the USA revolved around the [[HP-41]], which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than [[B3-34]].

====Technical improvements====
[[File:Solar-calculator.jpg|thumb|A calculator which runs on solar and battery power]]
Through the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs) were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom ''LE-120A "HANDY"'' calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] display, and announced the Busicom ''LC'' with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by [[Rockwell International]] and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking ''LC-800'', Harden ''DT/12'', Ibico ''086'', Lloyds ''40'', Lloyds ''100'', Prismatic ''500'' (a.k.a. ''P500''), Rapid Data ''Rapidman 1208LC''. The LCDs were an early form using the ''Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM'' with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.

A more successful series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD was launched in 1972 by [[Sharp Inc]] with the Sharp ''EL-805'', which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's ''Calculator On Substrate'' (COS) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.

[[File:Braun 4856 solar card calculator, 2.jpg|thumb|Credit-card-sized, solar-powered calculator by [[Braun (company)|Braun]] (1987)]]
In the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect, ''twisted nematic'' (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging [[ultraviolet]] rays. The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the [[Casio]] ''Mini Card LC-78'' of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.

There were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first "calculator on a chip" [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more ICs, especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.

The power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of [[CMOS]] technology. Appearing in the Sharp "EL-801" in 1972, the [[transistor]]s in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays often required added driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCDs were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.

With this low power consumption came the possibility of using [[solar cell]]s as the power source, realised around 1978 by calculators such as the Royal ''Solar 1'', Sharp ''EL-8026'', and Teal ''Photon''.

====Mass market phase====
At the start of the 1970s, hand-held electronic calculators were very costly, at two or three weeks' wages, and so were a luxury item. The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were costly to produce, and production runs that were too small to exploit economies of scale. Many firms saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on such high prices. However, the cost of calculators fell as components and their production methods improved, and the effect of economies of scale was felt.

By 1976, the cost of the cheapest four-function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars, about 1/20th of the cost five years before. The results of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators, leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing down. The firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Mid-1980s to present===
[[File:Elektronika MK-52.JPG|thumb|The [[Elektronika MK-52]] was a programmable RPN-style calculator that accepted extension modules; it was manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] from 1985 to 1992]]
The first calculator capable of symbolic computing was the [[HP-28C]], released in 1987. It could, for example, solve quadratic equations symbolically. The first [[graphing calculator]] was the [[Casio fx-7000G]] released in 1985.

The two leading manufacturers, HP and TI, released increasingly feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s. At the turn of the millennium, the line between a graphing calculator and a [[handheld computer]] was not always clear, as some very advanced calculators such as the [[TI-89]], the [[TI-92 series|Voyage 200]] and [[HP-49G]] could [[derivative|differentiate]] and [[integral|integrate]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, solve [[differential equation]]s, run [[word processing]] and [[Personal information manager|PIM]] software, and connect by wire or [[infrared|IR]] to other calculators/computers.

The [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes. The HP 12c featured the [[reverse Polish notation]] mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the "HP 12c platinum edition" which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry.

[[Calculated Industries]] competed with the [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling; changing the “I”, “PV”, “FV” to easier labeling terms such as "Int", "Term", "Pmt", and not using the [[reverse Polish notation]]. However, CI's more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators, which evolved and expanded in the 1990s to present. According to Mark Bollman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Bollman |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html |title=Mark-&gt;'s Calculator Collection |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |date= |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135244/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College, the "Construction Master is the first in a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators" which carried them through the 1980s, 1990s, and to the present.

Personal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functions of a calculator, using the [[graphical user interface]] to portray a calculator. One such example is [[Calculator (Windows)|Windows Calculator]]. Most [[personal data assistant]]s (PDAs) and [[smartphone]]s also have such a feature.

==Use in education==
In most countries, [[student]]s use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic or [[elementary arithmetic]] skills would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations ''in the head'', with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching [[Approximation|estimation]] methods and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Thomas J.

A TI spokesman said that it would actively seek what was due, either in cash or technology cross-licensing agreements. 19 other countries, including the United Kingdom, had already granted a similar patent to Texas Instruments. – ''New Scientist'', 17 August 1978 p455, and ''Practical Electronics'' (British publication), October 1978 p1094.

'''Charles Haros''' was a [[geometer]] ([[mathematician]]) in the French [[Bureau du Cadastre]] at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century.

== Haros' conversion table ==

One of the primary tasks of the Bureau du Cadastre was the accurate [[map]]ping of [[France]] for the purpose of [[taxation]] but from time to time the bureau also provided computational services to other parts of the government.

One of the changes instituted by the [[French revolution]] was to convert France to the [[metric system]] and this necessitated changing from a fractional to a decimal representation of [[rational numbers]].  While Haros was involved many computation projects at the Bureau du Cadastre including the computation of de Prony’s tables of [[logarithms]] and the preparation of the French [[ephemeris]], [[Connaissance des Temps]], he is best known for a small table he prepared to convert fractions to their decimal equivalents.

Haros’ [[conversion table]] appeared in a tract, ''Instruction Abrégée sur les nouvelles Mesures qui dovient étre introduites dans toute république, au vendémiaire an 10; avec tables de rapports et reductions'', that was presented to the Mathematics Section of the [[Institut de France]] and subsequently abstracted in [[Journal de l'École Polytechnique]] under the title ‘’Tables pour évaluer une fraction ordinaire avec autant de decimals qu’on voudra; et pour trouver la fraction ordinaire la plus simple, et qui approche sensiblement d’une fraction décimale.‘’

In preparing his table Haros needed to create the list of all 3,003 [[Irreducible fraction|irreducible (vulgar) fractions]]  with denominators less than 100.  In order to make sure he got them all he harnessed an [[algorithm]] elucidated by [[Nicolas Chuquet]] some one-hundred and fifty years earlier.  Chuquet called it his ‘’règle des nombres moyens‘’.  Today we call it the [[Mediant (mathematics)|mediant]].  The mediant is the fraction between two fractions a/c and b/d whose [[numerator]] is the sum of the numerators, a+b, and whose [[denominator]] is the sum of the denominators, c+d.  That is, the mediant of the fractions a/c and b/d is the fraction (a+b)/(c+d).

In his paper Haros demonstrated that the mediant is always irreducible and, more importantly for this purposes, if you start with the sequence of fractions

:1/99, 1/98, 1/97, … , 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6,…, 96/97, 97/98, 98/99

and just keep applying the rule, only keeping the result if the denominator is less than one-hundred, then you generate all 3,003.

== A curious property ==

Roughly fifteen years later in [[England]], [[Henry Goodwyn]] set out to create a much more ambitious version of Haros’ table.  In particular, Goodwyn wanted to tabulate the decimal values for all [[irreducible fraction]]s with denominators less than or equal to 1,024.  There are 318,963 such fractions.  As a warm up and a test of the commercial market for such a table in 1816 he published for private circulation The First Centenary of a Series of Concise and Useful Tables of all the Complete Decimal Quotients, which can arise from dividing a unit, or any whole Number less than each Divisor by all Integers from  1 to 1024.

[[John Farey, Sr.|John Farey]] observed the mediant property in this table and mused in a letter to The [[Philosophical Magazine]] and Journal as follows:

:“I am not acquainted, whether this curious property of vulgar fractions has been before pointed out?; or whether it may admit of any easy or general demonstration ?; which are points on which I should be glad to learn the sentiments of some of your mathematical readers; …”

== (Mis)naming of the Farey sequence ==

[[Augustin Cauchy]] read Farey’s letter and published a paper “Démonstration d’un Théorème Curieux sur les Nombres” reproving Haros’ results without acknowledgement.  In his paper Cauchy referred to the mediant as “a remarkable property of ordinary fractions observed by M. J. Farey.”  Thus, an ordered sequence of all vulgar fractions with denominators less than a given value became known as a [[Farey sequence]] rather than perhaps more rightfully as either a Chuquet sequence or a Haros sequence.

In mathematics, and especially in [[category theory]], a '''commutative diagram''' is a [[Diagram (category theory)|diagram]] such that all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that [[equations]] play in [[algebra]] (see Barr–Wells, Section 1.7).


==Description==
Parts of the diagram:
* objects (also known as ''vertices'') 
* [[morphism]]s (also known as ''arrows'' or ''edges'')
* path or [[category (mathematics)#Definition|composition]]
===Arrow symbols===
In algebra texts, the type of [[morphism]] can be denoted with different arrow usages: 
* [[monomorphism]]s with a &lt;math&gt;\hookrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* [[epimorphism]]s with a &lt;math&gt;\twoheadrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* [[isomorphism]]s with a &lt;math&gt;\overset{\sim}{\rightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;. 
* the dashed arrow typically represents the claim that the indicated morphism exists whenever the rest of the diagram holds; the arrow may optionally be labeled &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;. 
** If the dashed arrow is labeled &lt;math&gt;!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\exists!&lt;/math&gt;, the morphism is furthermore unique. 

These [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] are common enough that texts often do not explain the meanings of the different types of arrow.

===Verifying commutativity===
Commutativity makes sense for a [[polygon]] of any finite number of sides (including just 1 or 2), and a diagram is commutative if every polygonal subdiagram is commutative.

Note that a diagram may be non-commutative, i.e., the composition of different paths in the diagram may not give the same result.

==Phrases==
Phrases like "this commutative diagram" or "the diagram commutes" may be used.

==Examples==
In the bottom-left diagram, which expresses the [[Isomorphism_theorems#First_isomorphism_theorem|first isomorphism theorem]], commutativity means that &lt;math&gt;f = \tilde{f} \circ \pi&lt;/math&gt; while in the bottom-right diagram, commutativity of the square means &lt;math&gt;h \circ f = k \circ g&lt;/math&gt;:
{| style="width: 65%; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"
|-
| [[Image:First isomorphism theorem (plain).svg|175px]]
| [[Image:Commutative square.svg|150px]]
|}

For the diagram below to commute, we must have the three equalities: (1) &lt;math&gt; \; r \circ h \circ g = H \circ G \circ l, &lt;/math&gt; (2) &lt;math&gt; \; m \circ g = G \circ l, &lt;/math&gt; and (3) &lt;math&gt;\; r \circ h = H \circ m&lt;/math&gt;. 
Since the first equality follows from the last two, for the diagram to commute it suffices to show (2) and (3). However, since equality (3) does not generally follow from the other two equalities, for this diagram to commute it is generally not enough to only have equalities (1) and (2).

|}





==Diagram chasing==
'''Diagram chasing''' (also called '''diagrammatic search''') is a method of [[mathematical proof]] used especially in [[homological algebra]].  Given a commutative diagram, a proof by diagram chasing involves the formal use of the properties of the diagram, such as [[injective]] or [[surjective]] maps, or [[exact sequence]]s. A [[syllogism]] is constructed, for which the graphical display of the diagram is just a visual aid. It follows that one ends up "chasing" elements around the diagram, until the desired element or result is constructed or verified.

Examples of proofs by diagram chasing include those typically given for the [[five lemma]], the [[snake lemma]], the [[zig-zag lemma]], and the [[nine lemma]].

== In higher category theory ==
{{Main|Higher category theory}}

In higher category theory, one considers not only objects and arrows, but arrows between the arrows, arrows between arrows between arrows, and so on [[wiktionary:ad_infinitum|ad infinitum]]. For example, the category of small categories '''Cat''' is naturally a 2-category, with [[Functor|functors]] as its arrows and [[Natural transformation|natural transformations]] as the arrows between functors. In this setting, commutative diagrams may include these higher arrows as well, which are often depicted in the following style: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the following (somewhat trivial) diagram depicts two categories '''{{var|C}}''' and '''{{var|D}}''', together with two functors {{var|F}}, {{var|G}} : '''{{var|C}}''' → '''{{var|D}}''' and a natural transformation {{var|α}} : {{var|F}} ⇒ {{var|G}}:

:[[Image:2-commutative-diagram.svg|200px]]

There are two kinds of composition in a 2-category (called '''vertical composition''' and '''horizontal composition'''), and they may also be depicted via [[pasting diagrams]], see [[2-category#Definition]] for examples.

== Diagrams as functors ==
{{Main|Diagram (category theory)}}

A commutative diagram in a category ''C'' can be interpreted as a [[functor]] from an index category ''J'' to ''C;'' one calls the functor a '''[[diagram (category theory)|diagram]].'''

More formally, a commutative diagram is a visualization of a diagram indexed by a [[poset category]]:
* one draws a node for every object in the index category,
* an arrow for a generating set of morphisms,
*:omitting identity maps and morphisms that can be expressed as compositions,
* and the commutativity of the diagram (the equality of different compositions of maps between two objects) corresponds to the uniqueness of a map between two objects in a poset category.

Conversely, given a commutative diagram, it defines a poset category:
* the objects are the nodes,
* there is a morphism between any two objects if and only if there is a (directed) path between the nodes,
* with the relation that this morphism is unique (any composition of maps is defined by its domain and target: this is the commutativity axiom).

However, not every diagram commutes (the notion of diagram strictly generalizes commutative diagram): most simply, the diagram of a single object with an endomorphism  (&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt;), or with two parallel arrows (&lt;math&gt;\bullet \rightrightarrows \bullet&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;f,g\colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes called the [[free quiver]]), as used in the definition of [[equaliser (mathematics)|equalizer]] need not commute. Further, diagrams may be messy or impossible to draw when the number of objects or morphisms is large (or even infinite).

A '''computational model''' is a [[mathematical model]] in [[computational science]] that requires extensive [[computational resource]]s to study the behavior of a [[complex system]] by [[computer simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Melnik |editor-first=Roderick |title=Mathematical and Computational Modeling: With Applications in Natural and Social Sciences, Engineering, and the Arts |publisher=Wiley |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-118-85398-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system under study is often a complex [[nonlinear system]] for which simple, intuitive [[analytical solution]]s are not readily available. Rather than deriving a mathematical analytical solution to the problem, experimentation with the model is done by adjusting the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments.  Operation theories of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments.

Examples of common computational models are [[weather forecasting]] models, [[earth simulator]] models, [[flight simulator]] models, molecular [[protein folding]] models, and [[neural network]] models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10014">A '''computer-assisted proof''' is a [[mathematical proof]] that has been at least partially generated by [[computer]].

Most computer-aided proofs to date have been implementations of large [[Proof by exhaustion|proofs-by-exhaustion]] of a mathematical [[theorem]]. The idea is to use a computer program to perform lengthy computations, and to provide a proof that the result of these computations implies the given theorem.  In 1976, the [[four color theorem]] was the first major theorem to be verified using a [[computer program]].

Attempts have also been made in the area of [[artificial intelligence]] research to create smaller, explicit, new proofs of mathematical theorems from the bottom up using [[machine reasoning]] techniques such as [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] search. Such [[automated theorem prover]]s have proved a number of new results and found new proofs for known theorems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  Additionally, interactive [[proof assistant]]s allow mathematicians to develop human-readable proofs which are nonetheless formally verified for correctness.  Since these proofs are generally [[Non-surveyable proof|human-surveyable]] (albeit with difficulty, as with the proof of the [[Robbins conjecture]]) they do not share the controversial implications of computer-aided proofs-by-exhaustion.

== Methods ==
One method for using computers in mathematical proofs is by means of so-called [[validated numerics]] or [[rigorous numerics]]. This means computing numerically yet with mathematical rigour. One uses set-valued arithmetic and inclusion principle in order to ensure that the set-valued output of a numerical program encloses the solution of the original mathematical problem. This is done by controlling, enclosing and propagating round-off and truncation errors using for example [[interval arithmetic]]. More precisely, one reduces the computation to a sequence of elementary operations, say &lt;math&gt;(+,-,*,/)&lt;/math&gt;. In a computer, the result of each elementary operation is rounded off by the computer precision. However, one can construct an interval provided by upper and lower bounds on the result of an elementary operation. Then one proceeds by replacing numbers with intervals and  performing  elementary operations between such intervals of representable numbers.

==Philosophical objections==
{{main|Non-surveyable proof}}
Computer-assisted proofs are the subject of some controversy in the mathematical world, with [[Thomas Tymoczko]] first to articulate objections. Those who adhere to Tymoczko's arguments believe that lengthy computer-assisted proofs are not, in some sense, 'real' [[mathematical proof]]s because they involve so many logical steps that they are not practically [[Verification and validation|verifiable]] by human beings, and that mathematicians are effectively being asked to replace logical deduction from assumed axioms with trust in an empirical computational process, which is potentially affected by errors in the computer program, as well as defects in the runtime environment and hardware.&lt;ref name="tymoczko"&gt;{{Citation|last = Tymoczko|first = Thomas|author-link = Thomas Tymoczko|title = The Four-Color Problem and its Mathematical Significance|year = 1979|journal = [[The Journal of Philosophy]]|volume = 76|issue = 2|pages = 57–83|doi=10.2307/2025976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mathematicians believe that lengthy computer-assisted proofs should be regarded as ''calculations'', rather than ''proofs'': the proof algorithm itself should be proved valid, so that its use can then be regarded as a mere "verification".  Arguments that computer-assisted proofs are subject to errors in their source programs, compilers, and hardware can be resolved by providing a formal proof of correctness for the computer program (an approach which was successfully applied to the four-color theorem in 2005) as well as replicating the result using different programming languages, different compilers, and different computer hardware.

Another possible way of verifying computer-aided proofs is to generate their reasoning steps in a machine-readable form, and then use an [[automated theorem prover]] to demonstrate their correctness. This approach of using a computer program to prove another program correct does not appeal to computer proof skeptics, who see it as adding another layer of complexity without addressing the perceived need for human understanding.

Another argument against computer-aided proofs is that they lack [[mathematical elegance]]—that they provide no insights or new and useful concepts.  In fact, this is an argument that could be advanced against any lengthy proof by exhaustion.

An additional philosophical issue raised by computer-aided proofs is whether they make mathematics into a [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical science]], where the [[scientific method]] becomes more important than the application of pure reason in the area of abstract mathematical concepts. This directly relates to the argument within mathematics as to whether mathematics is based on ideas, or "merely" an [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in formal symbol manipulation. It also raises the question whether, if according to the [[mathematical Platonism|Platonist]] view, all possible mathematical objects in some sense "already exist", whether computer-aided mathematics is an [[observational study|observational]] science like astronomy, rather than an experimental one like physics or chemistry. This controversy within mathematics is occurring at the same time as questions are being asked in the physics community about whether twenty-first century [[theoretical physics]] is becoming too mathematical, and leaving behind its experimental roots.

The emerging field of [[experimental mathematics]] is confronting this debate head-on by focusing on numerical experiments as its main tool for mathematical exploration.

==Theorems for sale==
In 2010, academics at The [[University of Edinburgh]] offered people the chance to "buy their own theorem" created through a computer-assisted proof. This new theorem would be named after the purchaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herald Gazette article on buying your own theorem|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/your-own-maths-theorem-for-15-1.1068654|work=Herald Gazette Scotland|date=November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121000707/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/your-own-maths-theorem-for-15-1.1068654|archivedate=2010-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Informatics, Univ.of Edinburgh website|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/recentnews/theorem|work=School of Informatics, Univ.of Edinburgh|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In geometry, '''Conway polyhedron notation''', invented by [[John Horton Conway]] and promoted by [[George W. Hart]], is used to describe [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] based on a seed polyhedron modified by various prefix [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s.&lt;ref name="SoT"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Horton Conway|author2=Heidi Burgiel|author3=Chaim Goodman-Strass| title=The Symmetries of Things|year=2008|isbn=978-1-56881-220-5|chapter= Chapter 21: Naming the Archimedean and Catalan polyhedra and Tilings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|id=ConwayPolyhedronNotation|title=Conway Polyhedron Notation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway and Hart extended the idea of using operators, like [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] as defined by [[Kepler]], to build related polyhedra of the same symmetry. For example, ''tC'' represents a [[truncated cube]], and ''taC'', parsed as {{tmath|t(aC)}}, is a [[truncated cuboctahedron]]. The simplest operator [[Dual polyhedron|dual]] swaps vertex and face elements; e.g., a dual cube is an octahedron: ''dC''=''O''. Applied in a series, these operators allow many higher order polyhedra to be generated. Conway defined the operators ''abdegjkmost'', while Hart added ''r'' and ''p''.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/conway_notation.html|author=George W. Hart|title=Conway Notation for Polyhedra|website=Virtual Polyhedra|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway's basic operations are sufficient to generate the [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] and [[Catalan solid]]s from the Platonic solids. Some basic operations can be made as composites of others. Later implementations named further operators, sometimes referred to as "extended" operators.&lt;ref name="Antiprism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiprism.com/programs/conway.html|author=Adrian Rossiter|title=conway - Conway Notation transformations|website=Antiprism Polyhedron Modelling Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levskaya"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://levskaya.github.io/polyhedronisme/|author=Anselm Levskaya|title=polyHédronisme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, it is difficult to predict the resulting appearance of the composite of two or more operations from a given seed polyhedron. For instance, ambo applied twice is the expand operation: ''aa'' = ''e'', while a truncation after ambo produces [[bevel]]: ''ta'' = ''b''. Many basic questions about Conway operators remain open, for instance, how many operators of a given "size" exist.&lt;ref name=Brinkmann&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2017|title=Goldberg, Fuller, Caspar, Klug and Coxeter and a general approach to local symmetry-preserving operations|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=473|issue=2206|pages=20170267|arxiv=1705.02848|last1=Brinkmann|first1=G.|last2=Goetschalckx|first2=P.|last3=Schein|first3=S.|doi=10.1098/rspa.2017.0267|bibcode=2017RSPSA.47370267B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operators ==
In Conway's notation, operations on polyhedra are applied like functions, from right to left. For example, a [[cuboctahedron]] is an ''ambo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/conway_notation.html |title=Conway Notation for Polyhedra| website=Virtual Polyhedra| date=1998| first=George| last=Hart}} (See fourth row in table, "a = ambo".)&lt;/ref&gt; cube'', i.e. {{tmath|1=a(C) = aC}}, and a [[truncated cuboctahedron]] is {{tmath|1=t(a(C)) = t(aC) = taC}}. Repeated application of an operator can be denoted with an exponent: ''j&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''o''. In general, Conway operators are not [[commutative]]. The resulting polyhedron has a fixed topology (vertices, edges, faces), while exact geometry is not specified: it can be thought of as one of many [[graph embedding|embeddings]] of a [[polyhedral graph]] on the sphere. Often the polyhedron is put into [[Canonical polyhedron|canonical form]].

Individual operators can be visualized in terms of "chambers", as below. Each white chamber is a rotated version of the others. For [[achiral]] operators, the red chambers are a reflection of the white chambers. Achiral and [[chiral]] operators are also called local symmetry-preserving operations (LSP) and local operations that preserve orientation-preserving symmetries (LOPSP), respectively, although the exact definition is a little more restrictive.&lt;ref name="Brinkmann" /&gt;

The relationship between the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the seed and the polyhedron created by the operations listed in this article can be expressed as a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_x&lt;/math&gt;. When ''x'' is the operator, &lt;math&gt;v,e,f&lt;/math&gt; are the vertices, edges, and faces of the seed (respectively), and &lt;math&gt;v',e',f'&lt;/math&gt; are the vertices, edges, and faces of the result, then 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_x \begin{bmatrix} v \\ e \\ f \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v' \\ e' \\ f' \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

The matrix for the composition of two operators is just the product of the matrixes for the two operators. Distinct operators may have the same matrix, for example, ''p'' and ''l''. The edge count of the result is an integer multiple ''d'' of that of the seed: this is called the inflation rate, or the edge factor.&lt;ref name="Brinkmann" /&gt;

The simplest operators, the [[identity operator]] ''S'' and the [[Dual polyhedron|dual operator]] ''d'', have simple matrix forms:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_S = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{I}_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_d = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Two dual operators cancel out; ''dd'' = ''S'', and the square of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]]. When applied to other operators, the dual operator corresponds to horizontal and vertical reflections of the matrix. Operators can be grouped into groups of four (or fewer if some forms are the same) by identifying the operators ''x'', ''xd'' (operator of dual), ''dx'' (dual of operator), and ''dxd'' (conjugate of operator). In this article, only the matrix for ''x'' is given, since the others are simple reflections.

Hart introduced the reflection operator ''r'', that gives the mirror image of the polyhedron.{{cn|date=October 2018 &lt;!--Hart 1998?--&gt;}} This is not strictly a LOPSP, since it does not preserve orientation (it reverses it). ''r'' has no effect on achiral seeds, and ''rr'' returns the original seed. An overline can be used to indicate the other chiral form of an operator, like {{overline|''s''}} = ''rsr''. ''r'' does not affect the matrix.

An operation is irreducible if it cannot be expressed as a composition of operators aside from ''d'' and ''r''. The majority of Conway's original operators are irreducible: the exceptions are ''e'', ''b'', ''o'', and ''m''.

Some open questions about Conway operators include:&lt;ref name="Brinkmann" /&gt;
* Are there two non-equivalent series of operations, not related by ''d'' or ''r'', that create the same polyhedron from the same seed?
* How many Conway operators exist for a given inflation rate?
* Can an algorithm be developed to generate all the Conway operators for a given inflation rate?
* Can an algorithm be developed to decompose a given polyhedron into a series of operations on a smaller seed?

== Original operations ==
Strictly, seed (''S''), needle (''n''), and zip (''z'') were not included by Conway, but they are related to original Conway operations by duality so are included here.

From here on, operations are visualized on cube seeds, drawn on the surface of that cube. Blue faces cross edges of the seed, and pink faces lie over vertices of the seed. There is some flexibility in the exact placement of vertices, especially with chiral operators.

== Seeds ==
Any polyhedron can serve as a seed, as long as the operations can be executed on it. Common seeds have been assigned a letter.
The [[Platonic solid]]s are represented by the first letter of their name ([[Tetrahedron|'''T'''etrahedron]], [[Octahedron|'''O'''ctahedron]], [[Cube|'''C'''ube]], [[Icosahedron|'''I'''cosahedron]], [[Dodecahedron|'''D'''odecahedron]]); the [[prism (geometry)|'''p'''rism]]s ('''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''n''-gonal forms; [[antiprism|'''a'''ntiprisms]] ('''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); [[Cupola (geometry)|c'''u'''polae]] ('''U'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); [[anticupola]]e ('''V'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); and [[pyramid (geometry)|p'''y'''ramid]]s ('''Y'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Any [[Johnson solid|'''J'''ohnson solid]] can be referenced as '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''n''=1..92.

All of the five regular polyhedra can be generated from prismatic generators with zero to two operators:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/zefiro2008/__generation_of_icosahedron_by_5tetrahedra.htm|title=Generation of an icosahedron by the intersection of five tetrahedra: geometrical and crystallographic features of the intermediate polyhedra|author=Livio Zefiro|journal=Vismath|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regular Euclidean tilings can also be used as seeds:
* Q = Quadrille = [[Square tiling]]
* H = Hextille  = [[Hexagonal tiling]] = dΔ
* Δ = Deltille = [[Triangular tiling]] = dH

== Extended operations ==
These are operations created after Conway's original set. Note that many more operations exist than have been named; just because an operation is not here does not mean it does not exist (or is not an LSP or LOPSP). To simplify, only irreducible operators are 
included in this list: others can be created by composing operators together.

==Indexed extended operations==
A number of operators can be grouped together by some criteria, or have their behavior modified by an index.&lt;ref name="Antiprism" /&gt; These are written as an operator with a subscript: ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

===Augmentation===
[[Augmentation (geometry)|Augmentation]] operations retain original edges. They may be applied to any independent subset of faces, or may be converted into a ''join''-form by removing the original edges. Conway notation supports an optional index to these operators: 0 for the join-form, or 3 or higher for how many sides affected faces have. For example, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=O: taking a square-based pyramid and gluing another pyramid to the square base gives an octahedron.

The truncate operator ''t'' also has an index form ''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', indicating that only vertices of a certain degree are truncated. It is equivalent to ''dk&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;d''.

Some of the extended operators can be created in special cases with ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' operators. For example, a [[chamfered cube]], ''cC'', can be constructed as ''t''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''daC'', as a [[rhombic dodecahedron]], ''daC'' or ''jC'', with its degree-4 vertices truncated. A lofted cube, ''lC'' is the same as ''t''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''kC''. A quinto-dodecahedron, ''qD'' can be constructed as ''t''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''daaD'' or ''t''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''deD'' or ''t''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''oD'', a [[deltoidal hexecontahedron]], ''deD'' or ''oD'', with its degree-5 vertices truncated.

===Meta/Bevel===
Meta adds vertices at the center and along the edges, while bevel adds faces at the center, seed vertices, and along the edges. The index is how many vertices or faces are added along the edges. Meta (in its non-indexed form) is also called [[cantitruncation]] or [[omnitruncation]]. Note that 0 here does not mean the same as for augmentation operations: it means zero vertices (or faces) are added along the edges.&lt;ref name="Antiprism" /&gt;

Medial is like meta, except it does not add edges from the center to each seed vertex.

Note that ''o'' and ''e'' have their own indexed forms, described below. Also note that some implementations start indexing at 0 instead of 1.&lt;ref name="Antiprism" /&gt;

===Goldberg-Coxeter===
The Goldberg-Coxeter (GC) Conway operators are two infinite families of operators that are an extension of the [[Goldberg-Coxeter construction]].&lt;ref name="Deza2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=[[Michel Deza|Deza, M.]]|author2=Dutour, M|title=Goldberg–Coxeter constructions for 3-and 4-valent plane graphs|journal=The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics |volume=11|year=2004|pp=#R20|url=http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v11i1r20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deza2015&gt;{{cite book|author1=Deza, M.-M.|author2=Sikirić, M. D.|author3=Shtogrin, M. I. | year=2015 |title=Geometric Structure of Chemistry-Relevant Graphs: Zigzags and Central Circuits|publisher=Springer|pp=131–148 |chapter=Goldberg–Coxeter Construction and Parameterization|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HLi4CQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=goldberg-coxeter&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=goldberg-coxeter&amp;f=false   |isbn=9788132224495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GC construction can be thought of as taking a triangular section of a triangular lattice, or a square section of a square lattice, and laying that over each face of the polyhedron. This construction can be extended to any face by identifying the chambers of the triangle or square (the "master polygon").&lt;ref name="Brinkmann" /&gt; Operators in the triangular family can be used to produce the [[Goldberg polyhedra]] and [[geodesic polyhedra]]: see [[List of geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra]] for formulas.

The two families are the triangular GC family, ''c&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''u&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the quadrilateral GC family, ''e&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''o&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;''. Both the GC families are indexed by two integers &lt;math&gt;a \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;. They possess many nice qualities:
* The indexes of the families have a relationship with certain [[Euclidean domain]]s over the complex numbers: the [[Eisenstein integers]] for the triangular GC family, and the [[Gaussian integers]] for the quadrilateral GC family.
* Operators in the ''x'' and ''dxd'' columns within the same family commute with each other.

The operators are divided into three classes (examples are written in terms of ''c'' but apply to all 4 operators):
* Class I: {{tmath|1=b=0}}. Achiral, preserves original edges. Can be written with the zero index suppressed, e.g. ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''a'',0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''.
* Class II: {{tmath|1=a=b}}. Also achiral. Can be decomposed as ''c&lt;sub&gt;a,a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''c&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;c''&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt;
* Class III: All other operators. These are chiral, and ''c&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''c&lt;sub&gt;b,a&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the chiral pairs of each other.

Of the original Conway operations, the only ones that do not fall into the GC family are ''g'' and ''s'' (gyro and snub). Meta and bevel (''m'' and ''b'') can be expressed in terms of one operator from the triangular family and one from the quadrilateral family.

===Archimedean and Catalan solids===
Conway's original set of operators can create all of the [[Archimedean solids]] and [[Catalan solids]], using the [[Platonic solids]] as seeds. (Note that the ''r'' operator is not necessary to create both chiral forms.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4686">In [[mathematics]], an '''elementary proof''' is a [[mathematical proof]] that only uses basic techniques. More specifically, the term is used in [[number theory]] to refer to proofs that make no use of [[complex analysis]]. For some time it was thought that certain theorems, like the [[prime number theorem]], could only be proved using "higher" mathematics.  However, over time, many of these results have been reproved using only elementary techniques.

While the meaning has not always been defined precisely, the term is commonly used in [[mathematical jargon]]. An elementary proof is not necessarily simple, in the sense of being easy to understand: some elementary proofs can be quite complicated.&lt;ref name="Diamond1982"&gt;{{citation|first=Harold G.|last=Diamond|title=Elementary methods in the study of the distribution of prime numbers|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=7|issue=3|year=1982|pages=553–89|mr=670132|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1982-15057-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime number theorem==
The distinction between elementary and non-elementary proofs has been considered especially important in regard to the [[prime number theorem]]. This theorem was first proved in 1896 by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin]] using complex analysis. Many mathematicians then attempted to construct elementary proofs of the theorem, without success. [[G. H. Hardy]] expressed strong reservations; he considered that the essential "[[Mathematical jargon#deep|depth]]" of the result ruled out elementary proofs:
{{quote|No elementary proof of the prime number theorem is known, and one may ask whether it is reasonable to expect one. Now we know that the theorem is roughly equivalent to a theorem about an analytic function, the theorem that Riemann's zeta function has no roots on a certain line. A proof of such a theorem, not fundamentally dependent on the theory of functions, seems to me extraordinarily unlikely. It is rash to assert that a mathematical theorem ''cannot'' be proved in a particular way; but one thing seems quite clear. We have certain views about the logic of the theory; we think that some theorems, as we say "lie deep" and others nearer to the surface. If anyone produces an elementary proof of the prime number theorem, he will show that these views are wrong, that the subject does not hang together in the way we have supposed, and that it is time for the books to be cast aside and for the theory to be rewritten.|G. H. Hardy (1921). Lecture to Mathematical Society of Copenhagen. Quoted in Goldfeld (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;ref name="Goldfeld_2003_page_3"/&gt;}}
However, in 1948, [[Atle Selberg]] produced new methods which led him and [[Paul Erdős]] to find elementary proofs of the prime number theorem.&lt;ref name="Goldfeld_2003_page_3"&gt;{{ Citation| last = Goldfeld | first = Dorian M. | authorlink = Dorian M. Goldfeld | title = The Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem: An Historical Perspective | year = 2003 | page = 3
| url = http://www.math.columbia.edu/~goldfeld/ErdosSelbergDispute.pdf | format = [[PDF]]
| accessdate = October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A possible formalization of the notion of "elementary" in connection to a proof of a number-theoretical result is the restriction that the proof can be carried out in [[Peano axioms#Arithmetic|Peano arithmetic]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Also in that sense, these proofs are elementary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Friedman's conjecture==
{{main|Grand conjecture}}
[[Harvey Friedman]] conjectured, "Every theorem published in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' whose statement involves only finitary mathematical objects (i.e., what logicians call an arithmetical statement) can be proved in elementary arithmetic."&lt;ref name="Avigad2003"&gt;{{citation|last=Avigad|first=Jeremy|title=Number theory and elementary arithmetic|url=http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~avigad/Papers/elementary.pdf|journal=Philosophia Mathematica|year=2003|volume=11|issue=3|page=257, at 258|doi=10.1093/philmat/11.3.257}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The form of elementary arithmetic referred to in this conjecture can be formalized by a small set of axioms concerning integer arithmetic and mathematical induction. For instance, according to this conjecture, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] should have an elementary proof; [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]] is not elementary. However, there are other simple statements about arithmetic such as the existence of [[Tetration|iterated exponential]] functions that cannot be proven in this theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2115">The '''Fielden Chair''' of Pure Mathematics is an endowed professorial position in the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester]], [[England]]. 

==History==
In 1870 Samuel Fielden, a wealthy mill owner from [[Todmorden]], donated £150 to Owens College (as the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] was then called) for the teaching of evening classes and a further £3000 for the development of natural sciences at the college. From 1877 this supported the '''Fielden Lecturer''', subsequently to become the '''Fielden Reader'''  with the appointment of L. J. Mordell in 1922 and then '''Fielden Professor'''  in 1923.  [[Alex Wilkie]] FRS  was appointed to the post in  2007.&lt;ref&gt;Job advert for Wilkie's dowary post at Manchester, downloaded July 2007, [http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~mprest/furthpart.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Previous holders of the Fielden Chair (and lectureship) are:&lt;ref&gt;The list was furnished by the Archivist at the John Rylands Library, University of Manchester in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A working group was convened in September 2014, following the 2014 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], by former IMU President [[Ingrid Daubechies]] and Chair [[Peter J. Olver]] of the IMU’s Committee on Electronic Information and Communication (CEIC). Currently{{when|date=November 2016}} the working group has eight members, namely:

==Background==
In the spring of 2014, the Committee on Planning a Global Library of the Mathematical Sciences released a comprehensive study entitled “Developing a 21st Century Global Library for Mathematics Research.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18619/developing-a-21st-century-global-library-for-mathematics-research|title=Developing a 21st Century Global Library for Mathematics Research|first=National Research|last=Council|date=18 March 2014|publisher=|doi=10.17226/18619}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report states in its Strategic Plan section, “There is a compelling argument that through a combination of machine learning methods and editorial effort by both paid and volunteer editors, a significant portion of the information and knowledge in the global mathematical corpus could be made available to researchers as [[linked open data]] through the GDML."

==Workshop==
A workshop titled "Semantic Representation of Mathematical Knowledge" was held at the [[Fields Institute]] in Toronto during February 3–5, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/15-16/semantic/|title=Fields Institute - Semantic Representation of Mathematical Knowledge Workshop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframfoundation.org/programs/computable-archive-of-mathematics.html|title=Computable Archive of Mathematics: Wolfram Foundation Project (or Program)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the workshop was to lay down the foundations of a prototype semantic representation language for the GDML.  The workshop's organizers recognized that the extremely wide scope of mathematics as a whole made it unrealistic to map out the detailed concepts, structures, and operations needed and used in individual mathematical subjects.  The workshop therefore limited itself to surveys of the status quo in mathematical representation languages including representation of prominent and fundamental theorems in certain areas that could serve as building blocks for additional mathematical results, and to discussing ways to best identify and design semantic components for individual disciplines of mathematics.

The workshop organizers are presently{{when|date=November 2016}} preparing a report summarizing the workshop's conclusions and making recommendations for further progress towards a GDML.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1095">{{about|several concepts in mathematics that are called harmonic|other uses of the word|Harmonic (disambiguation)}}

In [[mathematics]], a number of concepts employ the word '''harmonic'''.  The similarity of this terminology to that of [[Harmonic|music]] is not accidental: the [[equations of motion]] of vibrating strings, drums and columns of air are given by formulas involving [[Laplacian]]s; the solutions to which are given by [[eigenvalue]]s corresponding to their modes of vibration.  Thus, the term "harmonic" is applied when one is considering [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] with [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] variations, or solutions of [[Laplace's equation]] and related concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11531">The study of [[manifold]]s combines many important areas of [[mathematics]]: it generalizes concepts such as [[curve]]s and [[surface (topology)|surface]]s as well as ideas from [[linear algebra]] and [[topology]]. Certain special classes of manifolds also have additional algebraic structure; they may behave like [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, for instance. In that case, they are called [[Lie Group]]s. Alternatively, they may be described by [[polynomial equations]], in which case they are called [[algebraic varieties]], and if they additionally carry a group structure, they are called [[algebraic group]]s.


== Nomenclature ==
The term "manifold" comes from German ''Mannigfaltigkeit,'' by Riemann.

In English, "manifold" refers to spaces with a differentiable or topological structure, 
while "variety" refers to spaces with an algebraic structure, as in algebraic varieties.

In Romance languages, manifold is translated as "variety" – such spaces with a differentiable structure are literally translated as "analytic varieties", while spaces with an algebraic structure are called "algebraic varieties". Thus for example, the french word "[[:fr:variété topologique|variété topologique]]" means [[topological manifold]]. In the same vein, the Japanese word "{{nihongo|多様体}}" (tayōtai) also encompasses both manifold and variety. ("{{nihongo|多様}}" (tayō) means various.)


==Background==
Ancestral to the modern concept of a manifold were several important results of 18th and 19th century mathematics. The oldest of these was [[Non-Euclidean geometry]], which considers spaces where [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] fails. [[Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri|Saccheri]] first studied this geometry in 1733. [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]], [[János Bolyai|Bolyai]], and [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] developed the subject further 100 years later. Their research uncovered two types of spaces whose geometric structures differ from that of classical [[Euclidean space]]; these are called [[hyperbolic geometry]] and [[elliptic geometry]]. In the modern theory of manifolds, these notions correspond to manifolds with constant, negative and positive [[curvature]], respectively.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] may have been the first to consider abstract spaces as mathematical objects in their own right.  His [[theorema egregium]] gives a method for computing the [[curvature]] of a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] without considering the [[ambient space]] in which the surface lies.  In modern terms, the theorem proved that the curvature of the surface is an intrinsic property. Manifold theory has come to focus exclusively on these intrinsic properties (or invariants), while largely ignoring the extrinsic properties of the ambient space.

Another, more [[topology|topological]] example of an intrinsic [[topological property|property]] of a manifold is the [[Euler characteristic]]. For a non-intersecting [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in  the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean plane]], with ''V'' vertices (or corners), ''E'' edges and ''F'' faces (counting the exterior) [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] showed that ''V''-''E''+''F''= 2.  Thus 2 is called the Euler characteristic of the plane.  By contrast, in 1813 Antoine-Jean Lhuilier showed that the Euler characteristic of the [[torus]] is 0, since the [[complete graph]] on seven points can be embedded into the torus. The Euler characteristic of other surfaces is a useful [[topological invariant]], which has been extended to higher [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]] using [[Betti number]]s. In the mid nineteenth century, the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] linked the Euler characteristic to the [[Gaussian curvature]].

[[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], when considered geometrically, are naturally manifold theories.  All these use the notion of several characteristic [[axis (mathematics)|axes]] or [[dimension]]s (known as [[generalized coordinates]] in the latter two cases), but these dimensions do not lie along the physical dimensions of width, height, and breadth.

In the early 19th century the theory of [[elliptic function]]s succeeded in giving a basis for the theory of [[elliptic integral]]s, and this left open an obvious avenue of research. The standard forms for elliptic integrals involved the [[square root]]s of [[cubic polynomial|cubic]] and [[quartic polynomial]]s. When those were replaced by polynomials of higher degree, say [[quintic polynomial|quintics]], what would happen? 

In the work of [[Niels Abel]] and [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]], the answer was formulated: the [[Abelian integral|resulting integral]] would involve functions of [[two complex variables]], having four independent ''periods'' (i.e. period vectors). This gave the first glimpse of an '''abelian variety''' of dimension 2 (an '''abelian surface'''): what would now be called the ''[[Jacobian variety|Jacobian]] of a [[hyperelliptic curve]] of genus 2''.

==Riemann==

[[Bernhard Riemann]] was the first to do extensive work generalizing the idea of a surface to higher dimensions. The name ''manifold'' comes from Riemann's original [[German language|German]] term, ''Mannigfaltigkeit'', which [[William Kingdon Clifford]] translated as "manifoldness". In his Göttingen inaugural lecture, Riemann described the set of all possible values of a variable with certain constraints as a ''Mannigfaltigkeit'', because the variable can have ''many'' values. He distinguishes between ''stetige Mannigfaltigkeit'' and ''diskrete'' ''Mannigfaltigkeit'' (''continuous manifoldness'' and ''discontinuous manifoldness''), depending on whether the value changes continuously or not. As continuous examples, Riemann refers to not only colors and the locations of objects in space, but also the possible shapes of a spatial figure. Using [[Mathematical induction|induction]], Riemann constructs an ''n-fach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit'' (''n times extended manifoldness'' or ''n-dimensional manifoldness'') as a continuous stack of (n−1) dimensional manifoldnesses. Riemann's intuitive notion of a ''Mannigfaltigkeit'' evolved into what is today formalized as a manifold. [[Riemannian manifold]]s and [[Riemann surface]]s are named after Bernhard Riemann.

In 1857, Riemann introduced the concept of [[Riemann surface]]s as part of a study of the process of [[analytic continuation]]; Riemann surfaces are now recognized as one-dimensional complex manifolds. He also furthered the study of abelian and other multi-variable complex functions.

==Contemporaries of Riemann==

[[Johann Benedict Listing]], inventor of the word "[[topology]]", wrote an 1847 paper "Vorstudien zur Topologie" in which he defined a "[[simplicial complex|complex]]". He first defined the [[Möbius strip]] in 1861 (rediscovered four years later by [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]]), as an example of a non-[[orientable surface]].

After Abel, Jacobi, and Riemann, some of the most important contributors to the theory of [[abelian function]]s were [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Charles Émile Picard|Picard]]. The subject was very popular at the time, already having a large literature. By the end of the 19th century, mathematicians had begun to use geometric methods in the study of abelian functions.

==Poincaré==

[[Henri Poincaré]]'s 1895 paper [[Analysis Situs (paper)|Analysis Situs]] studied three-and-higher-dimensional manifolds(which he called "varieties"), giving rigorous definitions of homology, homotopy, and [[Betti number]]s and raised a question, today known as the [[Poincaré conjecture]], based his new concept of the [[fundamental group]].  In 2003, [[Grigori  Perelman]] proved the conjecture using [[Richard S. Hamilton]]'s [[Ricci flow]], this is after nearly a century of effort by many mathematicians.

==Later developments==

[[Hermann Weyl]] gave an intrinsic definition for differentiable manifolds in 1912. During the 1930s [[Hassler Whitney]] and others clarified the [[foundations of mathematics|foundational]] aspects of the subject, and thus intuitions dating back to the latter half of the 19th century became precise, and developed through [[differential geometry]] and [[Lie group]] theory.

The [[Whitney embedding theorem]] showed that manifolds intrinsically defined by charts could always be embedded in Euclidean space, as in the extrinsic definition, showing that the two concepts of manifold were equivalent. Due to this unification, it is said to be the first complete exposition of the modern concept of manifold.

Eventually, in the 1920s, [[Solomon Lefschetz|Lefschetz]] laid the basis for the study of abelian functions in terms of complex tori. He also appears to have been the first to use the name "[[abelian variety]]"; in [[Romance languages]], "variety" was used to translate Riemann's term "Mannigfaltigkeit". It was [[André Weil|Weil]] in the 1940s who gave this subject its modern foundations in the language of algebraic geometry.

An '''integrator''' in measurement and control applications is an element whose output signal is the time [[integral]] of its input signal. It accumulates the input quantity over a defined time to produce a representative output.

Integration is an important part of many [[engineering]] and [[science|scientific]] applications. Mechanical integrators are the oldest application, and are still used in such  as metering of water flow or electric power. Electronic analogue integrators are the basis of [[analog computer]]s and charge amplifiers. Integration is also performed by digital computing algorithms.

==In signal processing circuits==
[[File:Op-Amp Integrating Amplifier.svg|400px|thumbnail|right|A circuit diagram of an integrating amplifier made using an operational amplifier.]]
:''See also [[Operational amplifier applications#Integration and differentiation|Integrator at op amp applications]]''

An [[electronics|electronic]] integrator is a form of first-order [[low-pass filter]], which can be performed in the continuous-time (analog) domain or approximated (simulated) in the discrete-time (digital) domain. An integrator will have a low pass filtering effect but when given an offset it will accumulate a value building it until it reaches a limit of the system or overflows.

A ''voltage integrator'' is an electronic device performing a time integration of an electric voltage, thus measuring the total volt-second product.

A ''current integrator'' is an electronic device performing a time integration of an [[electric current]], thus measuring a total [[electric charge]]. A [[charge amplifier]] is an example of current integrator. A current integrator is also used to measure the electric charge on a [[Faraday cup]] in a [[residual gas analyzer]] to measure partial pressures of gasses in a vacuum. Another application of current integration is in [[ion beam deposition]], where the measured charge directly corresponds to the number of ions deposited on a substrate, assuming the charge state of the [[ion]]s is known. The two current-carrying electrical leads must to be connected to the [[ion source]] and the substrate, closing the [[electrical network|electric circuit]] which in part is given by the ion beam.

==In software==
{{main|Numerical integration}}
* Integrators may also be software components.
* In some [[computational physics]] [[computer simulation]]s, such as [[numerical weather prediction]], [[molecular dynamics]], [[flight simulator]]s, [[reservoir simulation]], [[noise barrier]] design, [[architectural acoustics]], and [[electronic circuit simulation]], an integrator is a numerical method for integrating trajectories from forces (and thereby accelerations) that are only calculated at discrete time steps.

==Mechanical integrators==
{{Main|Differential analyser}}

Mechanical integrators were key elements in the mechanical [[differential analyser]], used to solve practical physical problems.  Mechanical integration mechanisms were also used in control systems such as regulating flows or temperature in industrial processes. Mechanisms such as the [[ball-and-disk integrator]] were used both for computation in differential analysers and as components of instruments such as [[Ship gun fire-control system|naval gun directors]], flow totalizers and others. A [[planimeter]] is a mechanical device used for calculating the definite integral of a curve given in graphical form, or more generally finding the area of a closed curve.  An [[integraph]] is used to plot the indefinite integral of a function given in graphical form.

== Drawbacks of ideal integrator ==
* Bandwidth is very small and used for only small range of input frequencies.
* For dc input (f = 0), the reactance of the capacitance, Xc, is infinite. Because of this op-amp goes into open loop configuration.In open loop configuration the gain is infinite and hence the small input offset voltages are also amplified and appears at output as error. This is referred as false triggering and must be avoided. Due to all such limitations, an ideal integrator needs to be modified. Some additional components are used along with ideal integrator circuit to reduce the effect of an error voltage in practice. This modified integrator is referred as practical integrator.

== Practical integrator (lossy integrator) ==
[[File:Frequency response of ideal and practical integrator.png|thumb|381x381px|
Frequency response of ideal and practical integrator
]]The gain of an integrator at low frequency can be limited to avoid the saturation problem if the feedback capacitor is shunted by a resistor Rf. The parallel combination of Rf and C behaves like a practical capacitor which dissipates power, unlike an ideal capacitor. For this reason this circuit is also called a lossy integrator. The resistor Rf limits the low frequency gain to (-Rf/R), generally [Rf=10*R1] and thus provides DC stabilisation.

== Applications ==
* Op-amp integrating amplifiers are used to perform calculus operations in analogue computers.
* Integrating circuits are most commonly used in analogue-to-digital converters, ramp generators and also in wave shaping applications.
* Another application would be to integrate a signal representing water flow, producing a signal representing the total quantity of water that has passed by the flow meter. This application of an integrator is sometimes called a totalizer in the industrial instrumentation trade.

[[File:Lawoflargenumbers.svg|An illustration of the law of large numbers using a particular run of rolls of a single [[dice|die]].  As the number of rolls in this run increases, the average of the values of all the results approaches 3.5.  While different runs would show a different shape over a small number of throws (at the left), over a large number of rolls (to the right) they would be extremely similar.|thumb|right|400 px]]
{{Probability fundamentals}}
In [[probability theory]], the '''law of large numbers''' ('''LLN''') is a [[theorem]] that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times.  According to the law, the [[average]] of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the [[expected value]], and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.

The LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the [[roulette]] wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. It is important to remember that the law only applies (as the name indicates) when a ''large number'' of observations is considered. There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be "balanced" by the others (see the [[gambler's fallacy]]).

==Examples==
For example, a single roll of a fair, six-sided die produces one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, each with equal [[probability]].  Therefore, the expected value of a single die roll is
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = 3.5&lt;/math&gt;
According to the law of large numbers, if a large number of six-sided dice are rolled, the average of their values (sometimes called the [[sample mean]]) is likely to be close to 3.5, with the precision increasing as more dice are rolled.

It follows from the law of large numbers that the [[empirical probability]] of success in a series of [[Bernoulli trial]]s will converge to the theoretical probability. For a [[Bernoulli random variable]], the expected value is the theoretical probability of success, and the average of ''n'' such variables (assuming they are [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)]]) is precisely the relative frequency.

For example, a [[fair coin]] toss is a Bernoulli trial. When a fair coin is flipped once, the theoretical probability that the outcome will be heads is equal to 1/2. Therefore, according to the law of large numbers, the proportion of heads in a "large" number of coin flips "should be" roughly 1/2.  In particular, the proportion of heads after ''n'' flips will [[almost surely]] [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to 1/2 as ''n'' approaches infinity.

Although the proportion of heads (and tails) approaches 1/2, almost surely the [[absolute difference]] in the number of heads and tails will become large as the number of flips becomes large. That is, the probability that the absolute difference is a small number, approaches zero as the number of flips becomes large. Also, almost surely the ratio of the absolute difference to the number of flips will approach zero. Intuitively, expected absolute difference grows, but at a slower rate than the number of flips, as the number of flips grows.

==History==
[[File:DiffusionMicroMacro.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Molecular diffusion|Diffusion]] is an example of the law of large numbers, applied to [[chemistry]]. Initially, there are [[solution|solute]] molecules on the left side of a barrier (magenta line) and none on the right. The barrier is removed, and the solute diffuses to fill the whole container.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Top:&lt;/u&gt; With a single molecule, the motion appears to be quite random.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Middle:&lt;/u&gt; With more molecules, there is clearly a trend where the solute fills the container more and more uniformly, but there are also random fluctuations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Bottom:&lt;/u&gt; With an enormous number of solute molecules (too many to see), the randomness is essentially gone: The solute appears to move smoothly and systematically from high-concentration areas to low-concentration areas. In realistic situations, chemists can describe diffusion as a deterministic macroscopic phenomenon (see [[Fick's law]]s), despite its underlying random nature.]]

The Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501–1576) stated without proof that the accuracies of empirical statistics tend to improve with the number of trials.&lt;ref&gt;Mlodinow, L. ''The Drunkard's Walk.'' New York: Random House, 2008.  p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; This was then formalized as a law of large numbers. A special form of the LLN (for a binary random variable) was first proved by [[Jacob Bernoulli]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Bernoulli, ''Ars Conjectandi: Usum &amp; Applicationem Praecedentis Doctrinae in Civilibus, Moralibus &amp; Oeconomicis'', 1713, Chapter 4, (Translated into English by Oscar Sheynin)&lt;/ref&gt; It took him over 20 years to develop a sufficiently rigorous mathematical proof which was published in his ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' (The Art of Conjecturing) in 1713. He named this his "Golden Theorem" but it became generally known as "'''Bernoulli's Theorem'''". This should not be confused with [[Bernoulli's principle]], named after Jacob Bernoulli's nephew [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. In 1837, [[Siméon Denis Poisson|S.D. Poisson]] further described it under the name "''la loi des grands nombres''" ("The law of large numbers").&lt;ref&gt;Poisson names the "law of large numbers" (''la loi des grands nombres'') in:  S.D. Poisson, ''Probabilité des jugements en matière criminelle et en matière civile, précédées des règles générales du calcul des probabilitiés'' (Paris, France:  Bachelier, 1837), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uovoFE3gt2EC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage p. 7]. He attempts a two-part proof of the law on pp. 139–143 and pp. 277 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian. (1983) "19th-century Cracks in the Concept of Determinism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 44 (3), 455-475 {{jstor|2709176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, it was known under both names, but the "Law of large numbers" is most frequently used.

After Bernoulli and Poisson published their efforts, other mathematicians also contributed to refinement of the law, including [[Pafnuty Chebyshev|Chebyshev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tchebichef | first1 = P. | title = Démonstration élémentaire d'une proposition générale de la théorie des probabilités | doi = 10.1515/crll.1846.33.259 | journal = Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Crelles Journal) | volume = 1846 | issue = 33 | pages = 259–267 | year = 1846 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrey Markov|Markov]], [[Émile Borel|Borel]], [[Francesco Paolo Cantelli|Cantelli]] and [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]] and [[Aleksandr Khinchin|Khinchin]]. Markov showed that the law can apply to a random variable that does not have a finite variance under some other weaker assumption, and Khinchin showed in 1929 that if the series consists of independent identically distributed random variables, it suffices that the [[expected value]] exists for the weak law of large numbers to be true.{{sfn|Seneta|2013}}&lt;ref name=EncMath&gt;{{cite web|author1=Yuri Prohorov|authorlink1=Yuri Vasilyevich Prokhorov|title=Law of large numbers|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Law_of_large_numbers| website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; These further studies have given rise to two prominent forms of the LLN. One is called the "weak" law and the other the "strong" law, in reference to two different modes of [[limit of a sequence|convergence]] of the cumulative sample means to the expected value; in particular, as explained below, the strong form implies the weak.{{sfn|Seneta|2013}}

==Forms==
Two different versions of the '''law of large numbers''' are described below; they are called the '' '''strong law''' of large numbers'', and the '' '''weak law''' of large numbers''.
Stated for the case where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... is an infinite sequence of [[i.i.d.]] Lebesgue integrable random variables with expected value E(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = E(''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ...= ''µ'', both versions of the law state that &amp;ndash; with virtual certainty &amp;ndash; the sample average

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n=\frac1n(X_1+\cdots+X_n) &lt;/math&gt;

converges to the expected value
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
\overline{X}_n \, \to \, \mu \qquad\textrm{for}\qquad n \to \infty,
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|law. 1}}}}

(Lebesgue integrability of ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' means that the expected value E(''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'') exists according to [[Lebesgue integration]] and is finite.  It does ''not'' mean that the associated probability measure is [[absolutely continuous]] with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]].)

An assumption of finite [[variance]] Var(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = Var(''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ... = ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; ∞ is '''not necessary'''. Large or infinite variance will make the convergence slower, but the LLN holds anyway. This assumption is often used because it makes the proofs easier and shorter.

[[Independence (probability theory)#More than two random variables|Mutual independence]] of the random variables can be replaced by [[pairwise independence]] in both versions of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etemadi|first1=N.Z.|title=An elementary proof of the strong law of large numbers|journal=Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie verw Gebiete|date=1981|volume=55|issue=1|pages=119–122|doi=10.1007/BF01013465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between the strong and the weak version is concerned with the mode of convergence being asserted. For interpretation of these modes, see [[Convergence of random variables]].

===Weak law===
[[File:Lawoflargenumbersanimation2.gif|thumb|Simulation illustrating the law of large numbers. Each frame, a coin that is red on one side and blue on the other is flipped, and a dot is added in the corresponding column. A pie chart shows the proportion of red and blue so far. Notice that while the proportion varies significantly at first, it approaches 50% as the number of trials increases.]]
The '''weak law of large numbers''' (also called [[Aleksandr Khinchin|Khinchin]]'s law) states that the sample average [[Convergence in probability|converges in probability]]  towards the expected value&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loève|1977|loc=Chapter 1.4, p. 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{P}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|law. 2}}}}

That is, for any positive number ''ε'',

: &lt;math&gt;
    \lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr\!\left(\,|\overline{X}_n-\mu| &gt; \varepsilon\,\right) = 0.
  &lt;/math&gt;

Interpreting this result, the weak law states that for any nonzero margin specified, no matter how small, with a sufficiently large sample there will be a very high probability that the average of the observations will be close to the expected value; that is, within the margin.

As mentioned earlier, the weak law applies in the case of i.i.d. random variables, but it also applies in some other cases. For example, the variance may be different for each random variable in the series, keeping the expected value constant. If the variances are bounded, then the law applies, as shown by [[Pafnuty Chebyshev|Chebyshev]] as early as 1867. (If the expected values change during the series, then we can simply apply the law to the average deviation from the respective expected values. The law then states that this converges in probability to zero.) In fact, Chebyshev's proof works so long as the variance of the average of the first ''n'' values goes to zero as ''n'' goes to infinity.&lt;ref name=EncMath/&gt; As an example, assume that each random variable in the series follows a [[Gaussian distribution]] with mean zero, but with variance equal to &lt;math&gt;2n/\log(n+1).&lt;/math&gt; At each stage, the average will be normally distributed (as the average of a set of normally distributed variables). The variance of the sum is equal to the sum of the variances, which is [[asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;n^2/\log n&lt;/math&gt;. The variance of the average is therefore asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;1/\log n&lt;/math&gt; and goes to zero.

An example where the law of large numbers does ''not'' apply is the [[Cauchy distribution]]. Let the random numbers equal the tangent of an angle uniformly distributed between −90° and +90°. The [[median]] is zero, but the expected value does not exist, and indeed the average of ''n'' such variables has the same distribution as one such variable. It does not tend toward zero as ''n'' goes to infinity.

There are also examples of the weak law applying even though the expected value does not exist. See [[#Differences between the weak law and the strong law]].

===Strong law===
The '''strong law of large numbers''' states that the sample average [[Almost sure convergence|converges almost surely]] to the expected value&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loève|1977|loc=Chapter 17.3, p. 251}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \bar{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{\text{a.s.}}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|law. 3}}}}

That is,

: &lt;math&gt;
    \Pr\!\left( \lim_{n\to\infty}\bar{X}_n = \mu \right) = 1.
  &lt;/math&gt;
What this means is that as the number of trials ''n'' goes to infinity, the probability that the average of the observations is equal to the expected value will be equal to one.

The proof is more complex than that of the weak law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/06/18/the-strong-law-of-large-numbers/ |title=The strong law of large numbers – What's new |publisher=Terrytao.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law justifies the intuitive interpretation of the expected value (for Lebesgue integration only) of a random variable when sampled repeatedly as the "long-term average".

Almost sure convergence is also called strong convergence of random variables. This version is called the strong law because random variables which converge strongly (almost surely) are guaranteed to converge weakly (in probability). The strong law implies the weak law but not vice versa, when the strong law conditions hold the variable converges both strongly (almost surely) and  weakly (in probability). 
However the weak law may hold in conditions where the strong law does not hold and then the convergence is only weak (in probability).{{clarify|reason=Warning: This is ambiguous. By using the fuzzy word "may", it says that EITHER the weak law is known to hold under broader conditions than the strong law, OR the weak law is known to hold under certain conditions where the strong law is not known to hold, OR it is not known whether the weak law holds under broader conditions that the strong law. |date=November 2016}}

&lt;!--The reference provided for the following doesn't seem to say this:
There are different views among mathematicians whether the two laws could be unified to one law, thereby replacing the weak law.&lt;ref name="Testing Statistical Hypotheses"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kzPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;lpg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q=is%20of%20very%20limited%20interest%20and%20should%20be%20replaced%20by%20the%20more%20precise%20and%20more%20useful%20strong%20law%20of%20large%20numbers | title=Law of large numbers views }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date it has not been possible to prove that the strong law conditions are the same as those of the weak law.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
--&gt;

The strong law of large numbers can itself be seen as a special case of the [[Ergodic theory#Ergodic theorems|pointwise ergodic theorem]].

The strong law applies to independent identically distributed random variables having an expected value (like the weak law). This was proved by Kolmogorov in 1930. It can also apply in other cases. Kolmogorov also showed, in 1933, that if the variables are independent and identically distributed, then for the average to converge almost surely on ''something'' (this can be considered another statement of the strong law), it is necessary that they have an expected value (and then of course the average will converge almost surely on that).&lt;ref name=EMStrong&gt;{{cite web|author1=Yuri Prokhorov|title=Strong law of large numbers|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Strong_law_of_large_numbers|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the summands are independent but not identically distributed, then

: &lt;math&gt;
    \bar{X}_n - \operatorname{E}\big[\bar{X}_n\big]\ \xrightarrow{\text{a.s.}}\ 0,
  &lt;/math&gt;

provided that each ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; has a finite second moment and

: &lt;math&gt;
    \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2} \operatorname{Var}[X_k] &lt; \infty.
  &lt;/math&gt;

This statement is known as ''Kolmogorov's strong law'', see e.g. {{harvtxt|Sen|Singer|1993|loc=Theorem 2.3.10}}.

An example of a series where the weak law applies but not the strong law is when ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is plus or minus &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{k/\log\log\log k}&lt;/math&gt; (starting at sufficiently large ''k'' so that the denominator is positive) with probability 1/2 for each.&lt;ref name=EMStrong/&gt; The variance of ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is then &lt;math&gt;k/\log\log\log k.&lt;/math&gt; Kolmogorov's strong law does not apply because the partial sum in his criterion up to ''k=n'' is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;\log n/\log\log\log n&lt;/math&gt; and this is unbounded.

If we replace the random variables with Gaussian variables having the same variances, namely &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{k/\log\log\log k},&lt;/math&gt; then the average at any point will also be normally distributed. The width of the distribution of the average will tend toward zero (standard deviation asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2\log\log\log n}&lt;/math&gt;), but for a given ε, there is probability which does not go to zero with ''n'' that the average sometime after the ''n''th trial will come back up to ε. Since this probability does not go to zero {{clarify|reason=How can we see this does not go to zero? |date=October 2018}}, it must have a positive lower bound ''p''(ε), which means there is a probability of at least ''p''(ε) that the average will attain ε after ''n'' trials. It will happen with probability ''p''(ε)/2 before some ''m'' which depends on ''n''. But even after ''m'', there is still a probability of at least ''p''(ε) that it will happen. (This seems to indicate that ''p''(ε)=1 and the average will attain ε an infinite number of times.)

===Differences between the weak law and the strong law===
The ''weak law'' states that for a specified large ''n'', the average &lt;math style="vertical-align:-.35em"&gt;\overline{X}_n&lt;/math&gt; is likely to be near ''μ''. Thus, it leaves open the possibility that &lt;math style="vertical-align:-.4em"&gt;|\overline{X}_n -\mu| &gt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; happens an infinite number of times, although at infrequent intervals. (Not necessarily &lt;math style="vertical-align:-.4em"&gt;|\overline{X}_n -\mu| \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all n).

The ''strong law'' shows that this [[almost surely]] will not occur. In particular, it implies that with probability 1, we have that for any {{nowrap|''ε'' &gt; 0}} the inequality &lt;math style="vertical-align:-.4em"&gt;|\overline{X}_n -\mu| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; holds for all large enough ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong law does not hold in the following cases, but the weak law does.&lt;ref name="Weak law converges to constant"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K6t5qn-SEp8C&amp;pg=PA432&amp;lpg=PA432&amp;q=%22even%20if%20the%20mean%20does%20not%20exist%22 | title=Weak law converges to constant | isbn=9780387276052 | author1=Lehmann | first1=Erich L | last2=Romano | first2=Joseph P | date=2006-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A NOTE ON THE WEAK LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS FOR EXCHANGEABLE RANDOM VARIABLES|url=http://www.mathnet.or.kr/mathnet/kms_tex/31810.pdf|publisher=Dguvl Hun Hong and Sung Ho Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=weak law of large numbers: proof using characteristic functions vs proof using truncation VARIABLES|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/266870/weak-law-of-large-numbers-proof-using-characteristic-functions-vs-proof-using-t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Let X be an [[Exponential distribution|exponentially]] distributed random variable with parameter 1. The random variable &lt;math&gt;\sin(X)e^X X^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; has no expected value according to Lebesgue integration, but using conditional convergence and interpreting the integral as a [[Dirichlet integral]], which is an improper [[Riemann integral]], we can say:

:&lt;math&gt; E\left(\frac{\sin(X)e^X}{X}\right) =\ \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x)e^x}{x}e^{-x}dx = \frac{\pi}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

2. Let x be [[Geometric distribution|geometric]] distribution with probability 0.5. The random variable &lt;math&gt;2^X(-1)^X X^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; does not have an expected value in the conventional sense because the infinite [[Series (mathematics)|series]] is not absolutely convergent, but using conditional convergence, we can say:

:&lt;math&gt; E\left(\frac{2^X(-1)^X}{X}\right) =\ \sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{2^x(-1)^x}{x}2^{-x}=-\ln(2) &lt;/math&gt;

3. If the cumulative distribution function of a random variable is

:&lt;math&gt; 1-F(x)=\frac{e}{2x\ln(x)},x \ge e  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  F(x)=\frac{e}{-2x\ln(-x)},x \le -e &lt;/math&gt;
:then it has no expected value, but the weak law is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Sayan|title=Law of large numbers|url=http://www.isds.duke.edu/courses/Fall09/sta205/lec/lln.pdf|access-date=2014-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309032810/http://www.isds.duke.edu/courses/Fall09/sta205/lec/lln.pdf|archive-date=2013-03-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=J.

===Uniform law of large numbers===
Suppose ''f''(''x'',''θ'') is some [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined for ''θ'' ∈ Θ, and continuous in ''θ''. Then for any fixed ''θ'', the sequence {''f''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''θ''), ''f''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''θ''), …} will be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, such that the sample mean of this sequence converges in probability to E[''f''(''X'',''θ'')]. This is the ''pointwise'' (in ''θ'') convergence.

The '''uniform law of large numbers''' states the conditions under which the convergence happens ''uniformly'' in ''θ''. If&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newey|McFadden|1994|loc=Lemma 2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177697731|title=Asymptotic Properties of Non-Linear Least Squares Estimators|year=1969|last1=Jennrich|first1=Robert I.|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|volume=40|issue=2|pages=633–643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Θ is compact,
# ''f''(''x'',''θ'') is continuous at each ''θ'' ∈ Θ for [[Almost everywhere|almost all]] ''x''s, and measurable function of ''x'' at each ''θ''.
# there exists a [[Dominated convergence theorem|dominating]] function ''d''(''x'') such that E[''d''(''X'')] &lt; ∞, and
#: &lt;math&gt; \left\| f(x,\theta) \right\| \leq d(x) \quad\text{for all}\ \theta\in\Theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Then E[''f''(''X'',''θ'')] is continuous in ''θ'', and

: &lt;math&gt;
    \sup_{\theta\in\Theta} \left\| \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i,\theta) - \operatorname{E}[f(X,\theta)] \right\| \xrightarrow{\mathrm{a.s.}} \ 0.
  &lt;/math&gt;

This result is useful to derive consistency of a large class of estimators (see [[Extremum estimator]]).

===Borel's law of large numbers===
'''Borel's law of large numbers''', named after [[Émile Borel]], states that if an experiment is repeated a large number of times, independently under identical conditions, then the proportion of times that any specified event occurs approximately equals the probability of the event's occurrence on any particular trial; the larger the number of repetitions, the better the approximation tends to be. More precisely, if ''E'' denotes the event in question, ''p'' its probability of occurrence, and ''N&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''E'') the number of times ''E'' occurs in the first ''n'' trials, then with probability one,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2323947?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103621939777 An Analytic Technique to Prove Borel's Strong Law of Large Numbers Wen, L. Am Math Month 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{N_n(E)}{n}\to p\text{ as }n\to\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
This theorem makes rigorous the intuitive notion of probability as the long-run relative frequency of an event's occurrence.  It is a special case of any of several more general laws of large numbers in probability theory.

'''[[Chebyshev's inequality]]'''. Let ''X'' be a [[random variable]] with finite [[expected value]] ''μ'' and finite non-zero [[variance]] ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then for any [[real number]] {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; 0}},
: &lt;math&gt;
    \Pr(|X-\mu|\geq k\sigma) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}.
  &lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of the weak law==
Given ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... an infinite sequence of [[i.i.d.]] random variables with finite expected value ''E''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''E''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ... = µ &lt; ∞, we are interested in the convergence of the sample average

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n=\tfrac1n(X_1+\cdots+X_n). &lt;/math&gt;

The weak law of large numbers states:
{{NumBlk||'''Theorem:''' &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{P}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationNote|law. 2}}}}

===Proof using Chebyshev's inequality assuming finite variance===
This proof uses the assumption of finite [[variance]] &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var} (X_i)=\sigma^2 &lt;/math&gt; (for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;). The independence of the random variables implies no correlation between them, and we have that

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Var}(\overline{X}_n) = \operatorname{Var}(\tfrac1n(X_1+\cdots+X_n)) = \frac{1}{n^2} \operatorname{Var}(X_1+\cdots+X_n) = \frac{n\sigma^2}{n^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The common mean μ of the sequence is the mean of the sample average:

:&lt;math&gt;
E(\overline{X}_n) = \mu.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Chebyshev's inequality]] on &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n &lt;/math&gt; results in

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{P}( \left| \overline{X}_n-\mu \right| \geq \varepsilon) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{n\varepsilon^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This may be used to obtain the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{P}( \left| \overline{X}_n-\mu \right| &lt; \varepsilon) = 1 - \operatorname{P}( \left| \overline{X}_n-\mu \right| \geq \varepsilon) \geq 1 - \frac{\sigma^2}{n \varepsilon^2 }.
&lt;/math&gt;

As ''n'' approaches infinity, the expression approaches 1. And by definition of [[convergence in probability]], we have obtained

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{P}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationNote|law. 2}}}}

===Proof using convergence of characteristic functions===
By [[Taylor's theorem]] for [[complex function]]s, the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of any random variable, ''X'', with finite mean μ, can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_X(t) = 1 + it\mu + o(t), \quad t \rightarrow 0.&lt;/math&gt;

All ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... have the same characteristic function, so we will simply denote this ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Among the basic properties of characteristic functions there are

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\frac 1 n X}(t)= \varphi_X(\tfrac t n) \quad \text{and} \quad
 \varphi_{X+Y}(t)=\varphi_X(t) \varphi_Y(t) \quad &lt;/math&gt; if ''X'' and ''Y'' are independent.

These rules can be used to calculate the characteristic function of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\overline{X}_n&lt;/math&gt; in terms of ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\overline{X}_n}(t)= \left[\varphi_X\left({t \over n}\right)\right]^n = \left[1 + i\mu{t \over n} + o\left({t \over n}\right)\right]^n \, \rightarrow \, e^{it\mu}, \quad \text{as} \quad n \rightarrow \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The limit &amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''it''μ&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the characteristic function of the constant random variable μ, and hence by the [[Lévy continuity theorem]], &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle\overline{X}_n&lt;/math&gt; [[Convergence in distribution|converges in distribution]] to μ:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n \, \xrightarrow{\mathcal D} \, \mu \qquad\text{for}\qquad n \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

μ is a constant, which implies that convergence in distribution to μ and convergence in probability to μ are equivalent (see [[Convergence of random variables]].) Therefore,
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{P}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationNote|law. 2}}}}
This shows that the sample mean converges in probability to the derivative of the characteristic function at the origin, as long as the latter exists.

The table below is intended to assist people working with the alternative calculus called the [[Multiplicative calculus|"geometric calculus"]] (or its discrete analog). Interested readers are encouraged to improve the table by inserting citations for verification, and by inserting more functions and more calculi.

== Table==

In the following table &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[digamma function]], &lt;math&gt;K(x)=e^{\zeta^\prime(-1,x)-\zeta^\prime(-1)}=e^{\frac{z-z^2}{2}+\frac z2 \ln (2\pi)-\psi^{(-2)}(z)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[K-function]], &lt;math&gt;(!x)=\frac{\Gamma(x+1,-1)}{e}&lt;/math&gt; is [[subfactorial]], &lt;math&gt;B_a(x)=-a\zeta(-a+1,x)&lt;/math&gt; are the generalized to real numbers [[Bernoulli polynomials]].

{{main|Duality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''duality''', generally speaking, translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] operation: if the dual of ''A'' is ''B'', then the dual of ''B'' is ''A''.

'''MatheAss''' (former '''Math-Assist''') is a [[computer program]] for [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] solutions in school mathematics and functions in some points similar to [[Microsoft Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vmancer.com/matheass-microsoft-mathematics-rival/] vmancer.com: "MatheAss: Microsoft Mathematics rival"&lt;/ref&gt; "MatheAss is widely spread in math classes"&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.chip.eu/en/MatheAss_74274.html] download.chip.eu: "MatheAss Download Info"&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany. For schools in the federal state of Hessen (Germany) exists a state license, which allows all secondary schools to use MatheAss&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienzentren-hessen.de/?page_id=75] MatheAss {{!}} LKM - Hessen&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Its functionality is limited compared to other numerical programs, for example, MatheAss has no [[Scripting language|script language]] and does no [[symbolic computation]]. On the other side it is easy to use and offers the user fully worked out solutions, in which only the necessary quantities need to be entered. MatheAss covers the topics algebra, geometry, analysis, stochastics, and linear algebra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathforum.org/library/view/61507.html] mathforum.org: "Math Forum @ Drexel Internet Mathematics Library: Math-Assist"&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After a precursor for the [[home computer]]s, usual around 1980, MatheAss appeared in 1983 as a shareware version for the PC, so it was one of the first [[shareware]] programs on the German market. MatheAss is available on the manufacturer's website for download for various versions of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.matheass.eu/download1.html] MatheAss: Download&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since version 8.2 (released in February 2011) MatheAss again offers a context-sensitive help, which was supplemented in many places by showing mathematical examples and background information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.matheass.eu/new.html] MatheAss: News&lt;/ref&gt; The MatheAss help file can also be viewed online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.matheass.eu/en/Content.html] MatheAss: Online Help&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematical diagrams''' are [[diagram]]s in the field of [[mathematics]], and diagrams using mathematics such as [[chart]]s and [[graph of a function|graphs]], that are mainly designed to convey mathematical relationships, for example, comparisons over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=2993&amp;topic=all Working with diagrams] at LearningSpace.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific types of mathematical diagrams ==

=== Argand diagram ===
[[Image:Complex number illustration.svg|thumb|120px|Argand diagram.]]
A [[complex number]] can be visually represented as a pair of numbers forming a vector on a diagram called an [[Argand diagram]]
The [[complex plane]] is sometimes called the ''Argand plane'' because it is used in ''Argand diagrams''. These are named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]] (1768–1822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician [[Caspar Wessel]] (1745–1818).&lt;ref&gt;Wessel's memoir was presented to the Danish Academy in 1797; Argand's paper was published in 1806.&lt;br/&gt;({{cite book |first1=Edmund Taylor |last1=Whittaker |first2=G.N. |last2=Watson |title=A Course of Modern Analysis: An Introduction to the General Theory of Infinite Processes and of Analytic Functions, with an Account of the Principal Transcendental Functions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULVdGZmi9VcC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=1927 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-58807-2 |page=9}})&lt;/ref&gt; Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[root of a function|zeroes]] of a [[mathematical function|function]] in the complex plane.

The concept of the complex plane allows a [[geometric]] interpretation of complex numbers. Under [[addition]], they add like [[vector (spatial)|vector]]s. The [[multiplication]] of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in [[polar coordinates]] — the magnitude or ''modulus'' of the product is the product of the two [[absolute value]]s, or moduli, and the angle or ''argument'' of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.

[[Image:Butterfly-FFT.png|thumb|120px|left|Butterfly diagram]]

=== Butterfly diagram ===
In the context of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms, a [[Butterfly diagram|butterfly]] is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller [[discrete Fourier transform]]s (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms). The name "butterfly" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case, as described below. The same structure can also be found in the [[Viterbi algorithm]], used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.

The [[butterfly diagram]] show a data-flow diagram connecting the inputs ''x'' (left) to the outputs ''y'' that depend on them (right) for a "butterfly" step of a radix-2 [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]]. This diagram resembles a [[butterfly]] as in the [[morpho|morpho butterfly]] shown for comparison), hence the name.

[[Image:5 lemma.svg|thumb|300px|A commutative diagram depicting the [[five lemma]]]]

=== Commutative diagram ===
{{Main|Commutative diagram}}

In mathematics, and especially in [[category theory]], a commutative diagram is a diagram of [[Object (category theory)|objects]], also known as vertices, and [[morphism]]s, also known as arrows or edges, such that when selecting two objects any directed path through the diagram leads to the same result by composition.

Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.

[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|left|120px|Hasse diagram.]]

=== Hasse diagrams ===
A [[Hasse diagram]] is a simple picture of a finite [[partially ordered set]], forming a [[Graph drawing|drawing]] of the partial order's [[transitive reduction]]. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from ''x'' to ''y'' precisely when ''x'' &lt; ''y'' and there is no ''z'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. In this case, we say y [[covering relation|covers]] x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.

[[Image:TrefoilKnot 01.svg|right|thumb|120px|Knot diagram.]]

=== Knot diagrams ===
In [[Knot theory]] a useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—;think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small perturbation in the choice of projection will ensure that it is [[Injective function|one-to-one]] except at the double points, called ''crossings'', where the "shadow" of the knot crosses itself once transversely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Rolfsen |title=Knots and links |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFLvAAAAMAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Publish or Perish |isbn=978-0-914098-16-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each crossing we must indicate which section is "over" and which is "under", so as to be able to recreate the original knot. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. If by following the diagram the knot alternately crosses itself "over" and "under", then the diagram represents a particularly well-studied class of knot, [[alternating knot]]s.

[[Image:Venn diagram cmyk.svg|thumb|120px|right|Venn diagram.]]

=== Venn diagram ===
A [[Venn diagram]] is a representation of mathematical sets: a mathematical diagram representing sets as circles, with their relationships to each other expressed through their overlapping positions, so that all possible relationships between the sets are shown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861733754/venn_diagram.html "Venn diagram"], Encarta World English Dictionary, North American Edition 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5ZATal Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is notnull.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Irving Lewis]] (1918). [https://archive.org/details/asurveyofsymboli00lewiuoft ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'']. Republished in part by Dover in 1960. p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Voronoi centerlines skeleton.gif|left|thumb|120px|Voronoi centerlines.]]

=== Voronoi diagram ===
A [[Voronoi diagram]] is a special kind of decomposition of a [[metric space]] determined by distances to a specified discrete set of objects in the space, e.g., by a [[discrete set]] of points. This diagram is named after [[Georgy Voronoi]], also called a Voronoi [[tessellation]], a Voronoi decomposition, or a Dirichlet tessellation after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

In the simplest case, we are given a set of points S in the plane, which are the Voronoi sites. Each site s has a Voronoi cell V(s) consisting of all points closer to s than to any other site. The segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to two sites. The Voronoi nodes are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites

[[Image:Wallpaper group diagram p4m square.svg|thumb|120px|right|Wallpaper group diagram.]]

=== Wallpaper group diagrams ===
A [[wallpaper group]] or ''plane symmetry group'' or ''plane crystallographic group'' is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. There are 17 possible distinct [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

Wallpaper groups are two-dimensional [[symmetry groups]], intermediate in complexity between the simpler [[frieze group]]s and the three-dimensional [[crystallographic group]]s, also called [[space group]]s. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. Subtle differences may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns which are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may belong to the same group.

=== Young diagram ===
A ''Young diagram'' or [[Young tableau]], also called [[Ferrers diagram]], is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row sizes weakly decreasing (each row has the same or shorter length than its predecessor). 
[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|120px|left|Young diagram.]]
Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of a positive integer ''n'', the total number of boxes of the diagram. The Young diagram is said to be of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and it carries the same information as that partition. Listing the number of boxes in each column gives another partition, the '''conjugate''' or ''transpose'' partition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;; one obtains a Young diagram of that shape by reflecting the original diagram along its main diagonal.

Young tableaux were introduced by [[Alfred Young]], a [[mathematician]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], in 1900. They were then applied to the study of symmetric group by [[Georg Frobenius]] in 1903. Their theory was further developed by many mathematicians.

A '''mathematician''' is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of [[mathematics]] in his or her work, typically to solve [[mathematical problem]]s.

Mathematics is concerned with [[number]]s, [[data]], [[quantity]], [[mathematical structure|structure]], [[space]], [[Mathematical model|models]], and [[mathematics#Change|change]].

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is on the history of mathematicians. For a history of mathematics in general, see [[History of mathematics]]}}

One of the earliest known mathematicians was [[Thales of Miletus]] (c. 624–c.546 BC); he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Boyer|year=1991|title=A History of Mathematics|page= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' Theorem]].

The number of known mathematicians grew when [[Pythagoras of Samos]] (c. 582–c. 507 BC) established the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean School]], whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was "All is number".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term "mathematics", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins.

The first woman mathematician recorded by history was [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (AD 350 - 415). She succeeded her father as Librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the Christian community in Alexandria punished her, presuming she was involved, by stripping her naked and scraping off her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/hypatia.html Ecclesiastical History, Bk VI: Chap. 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

Science and mathematics in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models and modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs,&lt;ref&gt;Abattouy, M., Renn, J. &amp; Weinig, P., 2001. Transmission as Transformation: The Translation Movements in the Medieval East and West in a Comparative Perspective. Science in Context, 14(1-2), 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and it turned out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. An example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this type of support was [[al-Khawarizmi]]. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths. Examples include the work on [[optics]], [[Mathematics|maths]] and [[astronomy]] of [[Ibn al-Haytham]].

The [[Renaissance]] brought an increased emphasis on mathematics and science to Europe. During this period of transition from a mainly feudal and ecclesiastical culture to a predominantly secular one, many notable mathematicians had other occupations: [[Luca Pacioli]] (founder of [[accounting]]); [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] (notable engineer and bookkeeper); [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (earliest founder of probability and binomial expansion); [[Robert Recorde]] (physician) and [[François Viète]] (lawyer).

As time passed, many mathematicians gravitated towards universities. An emphasis on free thinking and experimentation had begun in Britain's oldest universities beginning in the seventeenth century at Oxford with the scientists [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Robert Boyle]], and at Cambridge where [[Isaac Newton]] was [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Professor of Mathematics &amp; Physics]]. Moving into the 19th century, the objective of universities all across Europe evolved from teaching the “regurgitation of knowledge” to “encourag[ing] productive thinking.”&lt;ref&gt;Röhrs, "The Classical Idea of the University," ''Tradition and Reform of the University under an International Perspective'' p.20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Humboldt convinced the King of Prussia to build a university in Berlin based on [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]’s liberal ideas; the goal was to demonstrate the process of the discovery of knowledge and to teach students to “take account of fundamental laws of science in all their thinking.” Thus, seminars and laboratories started to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

British universities of this period adopted some approaches familiar to the Italian and German universities, but as they already enjoyed substantial freedoms and [[autonomy]] the changes there had begun with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the same influences that inspired Humboldt. The Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] emphasized the importance of [[research]], arguably more authentically implementing Humboldt’s idea of a university than even German universities, which were subject to state authority.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, science (including mathematics) became the focus of universities in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students could conduct research in [[seminars]] or [[laboratories]] and began to produce doctoral theses with more scientific content.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt; According to Humboldt, the mission of the [[University of Berlin]] was to pursue scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The German university system fostered professional, bureaucratically regulated scientific research performed in well-equipped laboratories, instead of the kind of research done by private and individual scholars in Great Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.17-18&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Rüegg asserts that the German system is responsible for the development of the modern research university because it focused on the idea of “freedom of scientific research, teaching and study.”&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Required education==
Mathematicians usually cover a breadth of topics within mathematics in their [[undergraduate education]], and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the [[graduate-level|graduate level]]. In some universities, a [[qualifying exam]] serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of mathematics; the students, who pass, are permitted to work on a [[doctoral dissertation]].

==Activities==
[[File:Noether.jpg|thumb|[[Emmy Noether]], mathematical theorist and teacher.]]

===Applied mathematics===
{{main|Applied mathematics}}
Mathematicians involved with solving problems with applications in real life are called [[applied mathematician]]s. Applied mathematicians are mathematical scientists who, with their specialized knowledge and [[professional]] methodology, approach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields. With professional focus on a wide variety of problems, theoretical systems, and localized constructs, applied mathematicians work regularly in the study and formulation of [[mathematical models]]. Mathematicians and applied mathematicians are considered to be two of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The discipline of [[applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry; thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[professional]] specialty in which mathematicians work on problems, often concrete but sometimes abstract. As professionals focused on problem solving, ''applied mathematicians'' look into the ''formulation, study, and use of mathematical models'' in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and other areas of mathematical practice.

===Abstract mathematics===
{{main|Pure mathematics}}
[[Pure mathematics]] is [[mathematics]] that studies entirely abstract [[concept]]s. From the eighteenth century onwards, this was a recognized category of mathematical activity, sometimes characterized as ''speculative mathematics'',&lt;ref&gt;See for example titles of works by [[Thomas Simpson]] from the mid-18th century: ''Essays on Several Curious and Useful Subjects in Speculative and Mixed Mathematicks'', ''Miscellaneous Tracts on Some Curious and Very Interesting Subjects in Mechanics, Physical Astronomy and Speculative Mathematics''.{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Simpson, Thomas |volume=25 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of [[navigation]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], and other applications.

Another insightful view put forth is that ''pure mathematics is not necessarily [[applied mathematics]]'': it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature, and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.&lt;ref name=Magid&gt;Andy Magid, Letter from the Editor, in ''Notices of the AMS'', November 2005, American Mathematical Society, p.1173. [http://www.ams.org/notices/200510/commentary.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.

To develop accurate models for describing the real world, many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be "pure" mathematics. On the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research.

===Mathematics teaching===
Many professional mathematicians also engage in the teaching of mathematics. Duties may include:
* teaching university mathematics courses;
* supervising undergraduate and graduate research; and
* serving on academic committees.

===Consulting===
Many careers in mathematics outside of universities involve consulting. For instance, actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk. Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design and price insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner which will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis.

As another example, mathematical finance will derive and extend the [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] or [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory, taking observed market prices as input. Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with economic theory. Thus, for example, while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain [[share price]], a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, and attempt to use [[stochastic calculus]] to obtain the corresponding value of [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s of the [[stock]] (''see: [[Valuation of options]]; [[Financial modeling#Quantitative finance|Financial modeling]]'').

== Quotations about mathematicians ==
The following are quotations about mathematicians, or by mathematicians.

: ''A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.''
::—Attributed to both [[Alfréd Rényi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Renyi.html |title=Biography of Alfréd Rényi |publisher=History.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Erdős]]

: ''Die Mathematiker sind eine Art Franzosen; redet man mit ihnen, so übersetzen sie es in ihre Sprache, und dann ist es alsobald ganz etwas anderes.'' (Mathematicians are [like] a sort of Frenchmen; if you talk to them, they translate it into their own language, and then it is immediately something quite different.)

: ''Each generation has its few great mathematicians...and [the others'] research harms no one.''
::—[[Alfred W. Adler]] (1930- ), "Mathematics and Creativity"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Adler, "Mathematics and Creativity," ''The New Yorker'', 1972, reprinted in Timothy Ferris, ed., ''The World Treasury of Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics'', Back Bay Books, reprint, June 30, 1993, p, 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.''
::—[[Edgar Allan Poe]], ''The purloined letter''

: ''A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.''
::—[[G. H. Hardy]], ''A Mathematician's Apology''

: ''Some of you may have met mathematicians and wondered how they got that way.''
::—[[Tom Lehrer]]

: ''It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul.''
::—[[Sofia Kovalevskaya]]

: ''There are two ways to do great mathematics. The first is to be smarter than everybody else. The second way is to be stupider than everybody else—but persistent.''
::—[[Raoul Bott]]
: ''Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and arithmetic the queen of mathematics.''
::—[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]&lt;ref&gt;''Sartorius von Waltershausen: Gauss zum Gedachtniss.

== Prizes in mathematics ==
There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics, though sometimes mathematicians have won the Nobel Prize in a different field, such as economics. Prominent prizes in mathematics include the [[Abel Prize]], the [[Chern Medal]], the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Gauss Prize]], the [[Frederic Esser Nemmers Prize|Nemmers Prize]], the [[Balzan Prize]], the [[Crafoord Prize]], the [[Shaw Prize]], the [[Steele Prize]], the [[Wolf Prize]], the [[Schock Prize]], and the [[Nevanlinna Prize]].

The [[American Mathematical Society]], [[Association for Women in Mathematics]], and other mathematical societies offer several prizes aimed at increasing the representation of women and minorities in the future of mathematics.

==Mathematical autobiographies==
Several well known mathematicians have written autobiographies in part to explain to a general audience what it is about mathematics that has made them want to devote their lives to its study. These provide some of the best glimpses into what it means to be a mathematician. The following list contains some works that are not autobiographies, but rather essays on mathematics and mathematicians with strong autobiographical elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3156">'''Mathematics mastery''' is an approach to [[mathematics education]] which is based on [[mastery learning]] in which most students are expected to achieve a high level of competence before progressing.  This technique is used in countries such as China and [[Singapore math|Singapore]] where good results have been achieved and so the approach is now being promoted in the [[UK]] by people such as schools minister [[Nick Gibb]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCETM/&gt;&lt;ref name=MM/&gt;&lt;ref name=TES/&gt;  Chinese teachers were brought to the UK to demonstrate the Shanghai mastery approach in 2015.&lt;ref name=G2/&gt;  A trial was made in the UK with about 10,000 students of ages 5–6 and 11–12.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  In one year, test scores indicated that the students were about a month ahead of students in schools using other approaches.&lt;ref name=G/&gt; This result was considered small but significant.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;

The National Association of Mathematics Advisers has highlighted five issues in understanding this approach.&lt;ref name=NAMA/&gt;
#Variation in the methods promoted by different organisations

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">A '''minimax theorem''' is a theorem providing conditions that guarantee that the [[max–min inequality]] is also an equality. 
The first theorem in this sense is [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s minimax theorem from 1928, which was considered the starting point of [[game theory]]. 
Since then, several generalizations and alternative versions of von Neumann's original theorem have appeared in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Du|editor1-first=Ding-Zhu|editor2-last=Pardalos|editor2-first=Panos M.|title=Minimax and Applications|date=1995|publisher=Springer US|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781461335573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brandt|first1=Felix|last2=Brill|first2=Markus|last3=Suksompong|first3=Warut|year=2016|title=An ordinal minimax theorem|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825615001670|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=95|pages=107–112|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2015.12.010|arxiv=1412.4198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zero-sum Games ==
The minimax theorem was first proven and published in 1928 by [[John von Neumann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Von Neumann |first=J. |title=Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen|Math. Ann.]] |volume=100 |year=1928 |issue= |pages=295–320 |doi=10.1007/BF01448847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is quoted as saying "''As far as I can see, there could be no theory of games … without that theorem … I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved''".&lt;ref name=Casti&gt;{{cite book

Formally, von Neumann's minimax theorem states:

Let &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y \subset \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; be [[compact space|compact]] [[Convex set|convex]] sets. If &lt;math&gt;f: X \times Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function that is convex-concave, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot,y):X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is convex for fixed &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and
: &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot):Y\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is concave for fixed &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we have that

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{x\in X}\max_{y\in Y} f(x,y)=\max_{y\in Y}\min_{x\in X}f(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], a '''non-perturbative''' [[function (mathematics)|function]] or process is one that cannot be accurately described by [[perturbation theory]]. An example is the function

&lt;math&gt;f(x)=e^{-1/x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:expinvsq.svg|frame|The function ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−1/''x''²&lt;/sup&gt;. The Taylor series is identically zero, but the function is not.]]

The [[Taylor series]] at x = 0  for this function is exactly zero to all orders in perturbation theory, but the function is non-zero if ''x'' ≠ 0.

The implication of this for physics is that there are some phenomena which are impossible to understand by perturbation theory, regardless of how many orders of perturbation theory we use. [[Instanton]]s are an example.

Therefore, in [[theoretical physics]], a '''non-perturbative''' solution or theory is one that does not require perturbation theory to explicate, or does not simply describe the dynamics of perturbations around some fixed background.  For this reason, non-perturbative solutions and theories yield insights into areas and subjects perturbative methods cannot reveal.

{{broader|energy modeling}}

'''Open energy system models''' are [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]] that are [[open source software|open source]].{{efn|
The terminology is not settled.  These models can also be known as '''open energy models''' or '''open source energy system models''' or some combination thereof.
}}  Similarly open energy system data employs [[open data]] methods to produce and distribute [[dataset]]s primarily for use by open energy system models.

Energy system models are used to explore future energy systems and are often applied to questions involving [[energy policy|energy]] and [[Politics of global warming|climate policy]].  The models themselves vary widely in terms of their type, design, programming, application, scope, level of detail, sophistication, and shortcomings.&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}  For many models, some form of [[mathematical optimization]] is used to inform the solution process.

Several drivers favor the development of open models and open data.  There is an increasing interest in making [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a desire to leverage the benefits that open data and [[open-source software development|open software development]] can bring, including reduced duplication of effort, better sharing of ideas and information, improved quality, and wider engagement and adoption.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"/&gt;  Model development is therefore usually a [[collaborative software development model|team effort]] and constituted as either an academic project, a commercial venture, or a genuinely inclusive community initiative.

This article does not cover projects which simply make their [[source code]] or [[spreadsheet]]s available for public download, but which omit a recognized [[free software license|free and open-source software license]].

== General considerations ==

{{see also|Energy modeling|Open-source software development}}

=== Organization ===

An open energy system modeling project typically comprises a [[codebase]], [[dataset]]s, and [[software documentation]] and perhaps [[Scientific literature|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The project repository may be hosted on an institutional server or on a public [[Comparison of open source software hosting facilities|code-hosting site]], such as [[GitHub]].  Some projects release only their [[codebase]], while others ship some or all of their [[dataset]]s as well.  Projects may also offer [[Electronic mailing list|email lists]], [[Online chat|chat rooms]], and [[Internet forum|web forums]] to aid collaboration.

The majority of projects are based within university research groups, either singingly or as academic collaborations.

A 2017 paper lists the benefits of open data and models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;

 | access-date = 2017-02-03
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  The paper makes a number of recommendations for projects wishing to transition to a more open approach.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|214}}  The authors also conclude that, in terms of openness, energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213–214}}

=== Growth ===

Open energy system modeling came of age in the 2010s.  Just two projects were cited in a 2011 paper on the topic: [[#OSeMOSYS|OSeMOSYS]] and [[#TEMOA|TEMOA]].&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"/&gt;{{rp|5861}}  [[#Balmorel|Balmorel]] was also active at that time, having been made public in 2001.{{efn|
[[#NEMO|NEMO]] was also under development in 2011 but it is unclear whether its codebase was public at that point.
}}  {{as of|2017|03}}, this article lists 25 such undertakings (with a further six waiting to be [[Talk:Open energy system models#Further models|added]]).

=== Transparency, comprehensibility, and reproducibility ===

{{see also|Open Energy Modelling Initiative#Context}}

The use of open energy system models and open energy data represents one attempt to improve the transparency, comprehensibility, and reproducibility of energy system models, particularly those used to aid public policy development.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"/&gt;

A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that "an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development".&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010a"&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/ref&gt;  To further honor the process of [[peer review]], researchers argue, in a 2012 paper, that it is essential to place both the [[source code]] and [[dataset]]s under publicly accessible [[version control]] so that third-parties can run, verify, and scrutinize specific models.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 paper contends that model-based energy scenario studies, seeking to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent.  To these ends, the paper provides a [[checklist]] of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers.  The authors however state that they "consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice."&lt;ref name="cao-etal-2016"&gt;

A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State projects ===

State-sponsored open source projects in any domain are a relatively new phenomena.

{{as of|2017}}, the [[European Commission]] now supports several open source energy system modeling projects to aid the transition to a low-carbon energy system for Europe.  The Dispa-SET project ([[#Dispa-SET|below]]) is modeling the European electricity system and hosts its codebase on [[GitHub]].  The MEDEAS project, which will design and implement a new open source energy-economy model for Europe, held its kick-off meeting in February 2016.&lt;ref name="set-plan-2016-one"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2017|02}}, the project had yet to publish any source code.  The established OSeMOSYS project ([[#OSeMOSYS|below]]) is developing a multi-sector energy model for Europe with Commission funding to support stakeholder outreach.&lt;ref name="howells-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[National Energy Modeling System|NEMS]] national model is available but nonetheless difficult to use.  NEMS does not classify as an open source project in the accepted sense.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"/&gt;

== Open electricity sector models ==

Open electricity sector models are confined to just the electricity sector.  These models invariably have a temporal resolution of one hour or less.  Some models concentrate on the engineering characteristics of the system, including a good representation of [[Electric power transmission|high-voltage transmission networks]] and [[Power-flow study|AC power flow]].  Others models depict electricity [[spot market]]s and are known as dispatch models.  While other models embed [[Agent-based model|autonomous agents]] to capture, for instance, [[Auction|bidding decisions]] using techniques from [[bounded rationality]].  The ability to handle [[variable renewable energy]], transmission systems, and [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] are becoming important considerations.

DIETER stands for Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables.  DIETER is a dispatch and investment model. It was first used to study the role of [[Grid energy storage|power storage]] and other flexibility options in a future [[Greenfield project|greenfield]] setting with high shares of renewable generation.  DIETER is being developed at the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), [[Berlin]], Germany.  The [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] for Germany can be downloaded from the project website.  The basic model is fully described in a DIW working paper and a journal article.&lt;ref name="zerrahn-and-schill-2015"&gt;

DIETER is framed as a pure [[Linear programming|linear]] (no integer variables) cost minimization problem.

The first study using DIETER examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60% to 100%.  Under the baseline scenario of 80% (the lower bound German government target for 2050), [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost.  Nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves.  Storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables, but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly biomass availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schill|first=Wolf-Peter|last2=Zerrahn|first2=Alexander|title=Long-run power storage requirements for high shares of renewables: Results and sensitivities|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model power system is managed by a single operator with full knowledge of the economic and technical characteristics of the generation units, the loads at each node, and the heavily simplified transmission network.  Demand is deemed fully [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic]].  The system is subject to intra-period and inter-period [[Unit commitment problem in electrical power production|unit commitment]] constraints (the latter covering nuclear and thermal generation for the most part) and operated under [[economic dispatch]].&lt;ref name="quoilin-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  Hourly data is used and the simulation horizon is normally one year.  But to ensure the model remains tractable, two day rolling horizon optimization is employed.

EMLab-Generation simulates the actions of [[Electric power industry|power companies]] investing in generation capacity and uses this to explore the long-term effects of various [[Energy policy|energy]] and [[Climate change mitigation|climate protection]] policies.  These policies may target renewable generation, {{CO2}} emissions, security of supply, and/or energy affordability.  The power companies are the main agents: they bid into power markets and they invest based on the [[net present value]] (NPV) of prospective power plant projects.  They can adopt a variety of technologies, using scenarios from the 2011 [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] [[World Energy Outlook]].&lt;ref name="iea-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The agent-based methodology enables different sets of assumptions to be tested, such as the heterogeneity of actors, the consequences of imperfect expectations, and the behavior of investors outside of ideal conditions.

EMLab-Generation offers a new way of modeling the effects of public policy on electricity markets.  It can provide insights into actor and system behaviors over time – including such things as investment cycles, abatement cycles, delayed responses, and the effects of uncertainty and risk on investment decisions.

A 2014 study using EMLab-Generation investigates the effects of introducing floor and ceiling prices for {{CO2}} under the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU ETS]].  And in particular, their influence on the dynamic investment pathway of two interlinked electricity markets (loosely Great Britain and Central Western Europe).  The study finds a common, moderate {{CO2}} auction reserve price results in a more continuous decarbonisation pathway and reduces {{CO2}} price volatility.  Adding a ceiling price can shield consumers from extreme price shocks.  Such price restrictions should not lead to an overshoot of emissions targets in the long-run.&lt;ref name="richstein-etal-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  EMMA is written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]] and uses the [[CPLEX]] commercial solver.

EMMA models electricity dispatch and investment, minimizing the total cost with respect to investment, generation, and trades between market areas.  In economic terms, EMMA classifies as a [[partial equilibrium]] model of the wholesale [[electricity market]] with a focus on the supply-side.  EMMA identifies short-term or long-term optima (or equilibria) and estimates the corresponding capacity mix, hourly prices, dispatch, and cross-border trading.  Technically, EMMA is a pure [[Linear programming|linear program]] (no integer variables) with about two million {{nowrap|non-zero}} variables.  {{as of|2016}}, the model covers Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland and supports conventional generation, renewable generation, and [[cogeneration]].&lt;ref name="hirth-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hirth-2014"&gt;

EMMA has been used to study the economic effects of the increasing penetration of [[variable renewable energy]] (VRE), specifically solar power and wind power, in the Northwestern European power system.  A 2013 study finds that increasing VRE shares will depress prices and, as a consequence, the competitive large-scale deployment of renewable generation will be more difficult to accomplish than many anticipate.&lt;ref name="hirth-2013"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Detailed descriptions of the software are available.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2016"/&gt;  GENESYS is written in [[C++]] and uses [[Boost (C++ libraries)|Boost]] libraries, the [[MySQL]] relational database, the [[Qt (software)|Qt{{nbsp}}4]] application framework, and optionally the [[CPLEX]] solver.

The GENESYS simulation tool is designed to optimize a future EUMENA (Europe, Middle East, and North Africa) power system and assumes a high share of renewable generation.  It is able to find an economically optimal distribution of generator, storage, and transmission capacities within a 21{{nbsp}}region EUMENA.  It allows for the optimization of this energy system in combination with an evolutionary method.  The optimization is based on a [[CMA-ES|covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy]] (CMA-ES), while the operation is simulated as a hierarchical set-up of system elements which balance the load between the various regions at minimum cost using the [[network simplex algorithm]].  GENESYS ships with a set of input time series and a set of parameters for the year 2050, which the user can modify.

A future EUMENA energy supply system with a high share of renewable energy sources (RES) will need a strongly interconnected energy transport grid and significant energy storage capacities.  GENESYS was used to dimension the storage and transmission between the 21{{nbsp}}different regions.  Under the assumption of 100% self-supply, about {{val|2500|u=GW}} of RES in total and a storage capacity of about {{val|240000|u=GWh}} are needed, corresponding to 6% of the annual energy demand, and a HVDC transmission grid of {{val|375000|u=GW·km}}.  The combined cost estimate for generation, storage, and transmission, excluding distribution, is 6.87{{nbsp}}¢/kWh.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"&gt;

A 2016 study looked at the relationship between storage and transmission capacity under high shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in an EUMENA power system.  It found that, up to a certain extent, transmission capacity and storage capacity can substitute for each other.  For a transition to a fully renewable energy system by 2050, major structural changes are required.  The results indicate the optimal allocation of photovoltaics and wind power, the resulting demand for storage capacities of different technologies (battery, pumped hydro, and hydrogen storage) and the capacity of the transmission grid.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2016"&gt;

NEMO, the National Electricity Market Optimiser, is a chronological dispatch model for testing and optimizing different portfolios of conventional and renewable electricity generation technologies.  It applies solely to the Australian [[National Electricity Market]] (NEM), which, despite its name, is limited to east and south Australia.  NEMO has been in development at the [http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/ Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets] (CEEM), [[University of New South Wales]] (UNSW), [[Sydney]], Australia since 2011.&lt;ref name="nemo-website"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The project maintains a small website and runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]].  NEMO is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  NEMO itself is described in two publications.&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2012"/&gt;{{rp|sec{{nnbsp}}2}}&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|sec{{nnbsp}}2}}  The data sources are also noted.&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2012"/&gt;{{rp|sec{{nnbsp}}3}}  Optimizations are carried out using a single-objective evaluation function, with penalties.  The solution space of generator capacities is searched using the [[CMA-ES]] (covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy) algorithm.  The timestep is arbitrary but one hour is normally employed.

NEMO has been used to explore generation options for the year 2030 under a variety of renewable energy (RE) and abated fossil fuel technology scenarios.  A 2012 study investigates the feasibility of a fully renewable system using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) with thermal storage, [[Wind power|windfarms]], [[photovoltaics]], existing [[hydroelectricity]], and [[biofuel]]led [[gas turbine]]s.  A number of potential systems, which also meet NEM reliability criteria, are identified.  The principal challenge is servicing peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days and periods of low wind.&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2012"&gt;

OnSSET is the OpeN Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit.  OnSSET is being developed by the [https://www.kth.se/en/itm/inst/energiteknik/forskning/desa Energy Systems Analysis Group] (dESA), [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden.  The software is used to examine areas not served by grid-based electricity and identify the technology options and investment requirements that will provide least-cost access to electricity services.  OnSSET is designed to support the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals|SDG{{nnbsp}}7]]: the provision of affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.  The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] implementation of the toolkit is known as PyOnSSET and was released on 26{{nbsp}}November 2016.  PyOnSSET does not ship with data, but suitable datasets are available from [[Open energy system databases#energydata.info|energydata.info]].  The project maintains a website and hosts a forum on [[Reddit]].&lt;ref name="onsset-website"&gt;

pandapower is a power system analysis and optimization program being jointly developed by the Energy Management and Power System Operation research group, [[University of Kassel]] and the Department for Distribution System Operation, [[Fraunhofer Institute]] for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology (IEE), both of [[Kassel]], Germany.  The codebase is hosted on [[GitHub]] and is also available as a [[Python Package Index|package]].  The project maintains a website, an [[Electronic mailing list|emailing list]], and online documentation.  pandapower is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  It uses the [[pandas (software)|pandas]] library for data manipulation and analysis and the PYPOWER library{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="pypower-website"&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; to solve for [[Power-flow study|power flow]].  Unlike some open source power system tools, pandapower does not depend on proprietary platforms like [[MATLAB]].

pandapower supports the automated analysis and optimization of [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] and transmission networks.  This allows a large of number of scenarios to be explored, based on different future grid configurations and technologies.  pandapower offers a collection of power system elements, including: lines, 2-winding transformers, 3-winding transformers, and ward-equivalents.  It also contains a switch model that allows the modeling of ideal bus-bus switches as well as bus-line/bus-trafo switches.  The software supports topological searching.  The network itself can be plotted, with or without geographical information, using the [[matplotlib]] and [[plotly]] libraries.

A 2016 publication evaluates the usefulness of the software by undertaking several case studies with major distribution system operators (DSO).  These studies examine the integration of increasing levels of [[photovoltaics]] into existing distribution grids.  The study concludes that being able to test a large number of detailed scenarios is essential for robust grid planning.  Notwithstanding, issues of data availability and problem dimensionality will continue to present challenges.&lt;ref name="scheidler-etal-2016"&gt;

A 2018 paper describes the package and its design and provides an example case study.  The article explains how users work with an element-based model (EBM) which is converted internally to a bus-branch model (BBM) for computation.  The package supports power system simulation, optimal power flow calculations (cost information is required), state estimation (should the system characterization lacks fidelity), and [[graph theory|graph]]-based network analysis.  The case study shows how a few tens of lines of scripting can interface with pandapower to advance the design of a system subject to diverse operating requirements.  The associated code is hosted on GitHub as [[Project Jupyter|jupyter notebooks]].&lt;ref name="thurner-etal-2018"&gt;

The PowerMatcher software implements a [[smart grid]] coordination mechanism which balances [[Distributed generation|distributed energy resources]] (DER) and flexible loads through autonomous [[bidding]].  The project is managed by the Flexiblepower Alliance Network (FAN) in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands.  The project maintains a website and the [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  {{as of|2016|06}}, existing datasets are not available.  PowerMatcher is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

Each device in the smart grid system – whether a washing machine, a wind generator, or an industrial turbine – expresses its willingness to consume or produce electricity in the form of a bid.  These bids are then collected and used to determine an equilibrium price.  The PowerMatcher software thereby allows high shares of renewable energy to be integrated into existing electricity systems and should also avoid any local overloading in possibly aging distribution networks.&lt;ref name="kok-2013"&gt;

renpass is an electricity dispatch model which minimizes system costs for each time step (optimization) within the limits of a given infrastructure (simulation).  Time steps are optionally 15 minutes or one hour.  The method assumes perfect foresight.  renpass supports the electricity systems found in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

The optimization problem for each time step is to minimize the electricity supply cost using the existing power plant fleet for all regions.  After this regional dispatch, the exchange between the regions is carried out and is restricted by the grid capacity.  This latter problem is solved with a heuristic procedure rather than calculated deterministically.  The input is the merit order, the marginal power plant, the excess energy (renewable energy that could be curtailed), and the excess demand (the demand that cannot be supplied) for each region.  The exchange algorithm seeks the least cost for all regions, thus the target function is to minimize the total costs of all regions, given the existing grid infrastructure, storage, and generating capacities.  The total cost is defined as the residual load multiplied by the price in each region, summed over all regions.

A 2012 study uses renpass to examine the feasibility of a 100% renewable electricity system for the [[Baltic Sea]] region (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden) in the year 2050.  The base scenario presumes conservative renewable potentials and grid enhancements, a 20% drop in demand, a moderate uptake of storage options, and the deployment of biomass for flexible generation.  The study finds that a 100% renewable electricity system is possible, albeit with occasional imports from abutting countries, and that biomass plays a key role in system stability.  The costs for this transition are estimated at 50{{nbsp}}€/MWh.&lt;ref name="bernhardi-etal-2012"&gt;

SciGRID, short for Scientific Grid, is an open source model of the German and European [[Electric power transmission|electricity transmission networks]].  The research project is managed by [http://www.next-energy.de/en/ Next Energy] (officially the EWE Research Centre for Energy Technology) located at the [[University of Oldenburg]], [[Oldenburg (Oldenburg)|Oldenburg]], Germany.  The project maintains a website and an email newsletter.  SciGRID is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses a [[PostgreSQL]] database.  The first release (v0.1) was made on 15{{nbsp}}June 2015.

SciGRID aims to rectify the lack of open research data on the structure of electricity transmission networks within Europe.  This lack of data frustrates attempts to build, characterise, and compare high resolution energy system models.  SciGRID utilizes transmission network data available from the [[OpenStreetMap]] project, available under the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), to automatically author transmission connections.  SciGRID will not use data from closed sources.  SciGRID can also mathematically decompose a given network into a simpler representation for use in energy models.&lt;ref name="matke-etal-2015"&gt;

SWITCH is a loose acronym for solar, wind, conventional and hydroelectric generation, and transmission.  SWITCH is an optimal planning model for power systems with large shares of renewable energy.  SWITCH is being developed by the Department of Electrical Engineering, [[University of Hawai'i]], [[Mānoa]], [[Hawaii]], USA.  The project runs a small website and hosts its [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] on [[GitHub]].  SWITCH is written in [[Pyomo]], an optimization components library programmed in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  It can use either the open source [[GLPK]] solver or the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.

SWITCH is a power system model, focused on renewables integration.  It can identify which generator and transmission projects to build in order to satisfy electricity demand at the lowest cost over a several year period while also reducing {{CO2}} emissions.  SWITCH utilizes multi-stage [[Stochastic linear program|stochastic linear optimization]] with the objective of minimizing the present value of the cost of power plants, transmission capacity, fuel usage, and an arbitrary per-tonne {{CO2}} charge (to represent either a carbon tax or a certificate price), over the course of a multi-year investment period.  It has two major sets of decision variables.  First, at the start of each investment period, SWITCH selects how much generation capacity to build in each of several geographic load zones, how much power transfer capability to add between these zones, and whether to operate existing generation capacity during the investment period or to temporarily mothball it to avoid fixed operation and maintenance costs.  Second, for a set of sample days within each investment period, SWITCH makes hourly decisions about how much power to generate from each dispatchable power plant, store at each [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]] facility, or transfer along each transmission interconnector.  The system must also ensure enough generation and transmission capacity to provide a planning reserve margin of 15% above the load forecasts.  For each sampled hour, SWITCH uses electricity demand and renewable power production based on actual measurements, so that the weather-driven correlations between these elements remain intact.

Following the optimization phase, SWITCH is used in a second phase to test the proposed investment plan against a more complete set of weather conditions and to add backstop generation capacity so that the planning reserve margin is always met.  Finally, in a third phase, the costs are calculated by freezing the investment plan and operating the proposed power system over a full set of weather conditions.

A 2012 paper uses [[California]] from 2012 to 2027 as a [[case study]] for SWITCH.  The study finds that there is no ceiling on the amount of wind and solar power that could be used and that these resources could potentially reduce emissions by 90% or more (relative to 1990 levels) without reducing reliability or severely raising costs.  Furthermore, policies that encourage electricity customers to shift demand to times when renewable power is most abundant (for example, though the well-timed charging of [[electric vehicle]]s) could achieve radical emission reductions at moderate cost.&lt;ref name="fripp-2012"&gt;

URBS, [[Latin]] for city, is a [[linear programming]] model for exploring capacity expansion and unit commitment problems and is particularly suited to [[Distributed generation|distributed energy systems]] (DES).  It is being developed by the [https://www.ens.ei.tum.de/en/ Institute for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Systems], [[Technical University of Munich]], Germany.  The [[codebase]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  URBS is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] optimization packages.

URBS classes as an energy modeling framework and attempts to minimize the total discounted cost of the system.  A particular model selects from a set of technologies to meet a predetermined electricity demand.  It uses a time resolution of one hour and the spatial resolution is model-defined.  The decision variables are the capacities for the production, storage, and transport of electricity and the time scheduling for their operation.&lt;ref name="huber-etal-2012"&gt;

== Open energy system models ==

Open energy system models capture some or all of the energy commodities found in an energy system.  All models include the electricity sector.  Some models add the heat sector, which can be important for countries with significant [[district heating]].  Other models add gas networks.  With the advent of [[Electric vehicle|emobility]], other models still include aspects of the transport sector.  Indeed, coupling these various sectors using [[power-to-X]] technologies is an emerging area of research.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Balmorel is written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]].

The original aim of the Balmorel project was to construct a [[partial equilibrium]] model of the electricity and [[Cogeneration|CHP]] sectors in the [[Baltic Sea]] region, for the purposes of policy analysis.&lt;ref name="ravn-etal-2001"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  These ambitions and limitations have long since been superseded and Balmorel is no longer tied to its original geography and policy questions.&lt;ref name="ravn-2012"/&gt;  Balmorel classes as a dispatch and investment model and uses a time resolution of one hour.  It models electricity and heat supply and demand, and supports the intertemporal storage of both.  Balmorel is structured as a pure [[linear programming|linear program]] (no integer variables).

{{as of|2016}}, Balmorel has been the subject of some 22{{nbsp}}publications.  A 2008 study uses Balmorel to explore the Nordic energy system in 2050.  The focus is on renewable energy supply and the deployment of hydrogen as the main transport fuel.  Given certain assumptions about the future price of oil and carbon and the uptake of hydrogen, the model shows that it is economically optimal to cover, using renewable energy, more than 95% of the primary energy consumption for electricity and district heat and 65% of the transport.&lt;ref name="karlsson-and-meibom-2008"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2010 study uses Balmorel to examine the integration of [[Plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid vehicle]]s (PHEV) into a system comprising one quarter wind power and three quarters thermal generation.  The study shows that PHEVs can reduce the {{CO2}} emissions from the power system if actively integrated, whereas a hands-off approach – letting people charge their cars at will – is likely to result in an increase in emissions.&lt;ref name="goeransson-etal-2010"&gt;

Calliope is an energy system modeling framework, with a focus on flexibility, high spatial and temporal resolution, and the ability to execute different runs using the same base-case dataset.  The project is being developed at the [https://www.usys.ethz.ch/en/ Department of Environmental Systems Science], [[ETH Zurich]], [[Zürich]], Switzerland.  The project maintains a website, hosts the [[codebase]] at [[GitHub]], operates an [https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope/issues issues tracker], and runs two [[Electronic mailing list|email lists]].  Calliope is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  It can link to the open source [[GLPK]] solver and the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.  PDF documentation is available.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A Calliope model consists of a collection of structured text files, in [[YAML]] and [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] formats, that define the technologies, locations, and resource potentials.  Calliope takes these files, constructs a pure [[Linear programming|linear optimization]] (no integer variables) problem, solves it, and reports the results in the form of [[pandas (software)|pandas]] [[data structures]] for analysis.  The framework contains five [[Abstract type|abstract]] base technologies – supply, demand, conversion, storage, transmission – from which new concrete technologies can be derived.  The design of Calliope enforces the clear separation of framework (code) and model (data).

A 2015 study uses Calliope to compare the future roles of [[nuclear power]] and [[Concentrated solar power|CSP]] in [[South Africa]].  It finds CSP could be competitive with nuclear by 2030 for baseload and more competitive when producing above baseload.  CSP also offers less investment risk, less environmental risk, and other co-benefits.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-and-keirstead-2015-a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A second 2015 study compares a large number of cost-optimal future power systems for [[Great Britain]].  Three generation technologies are tested: renewables, nuclear power, and fossil fuels with and without [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  The scenarios are assessed on financial cost, emissions reductions, and energy security.  Up to 60% of [[Variable renewable energy|variable renewable]] capacity is possible with little increase in cost, while higher shares require large-scale [[Grid energy storage|storage]], imports, and/or [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] renewables such as [[Tidal power|tidal range]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-and-keirstead-2015-b"&gt;

DESSTinEE stands for Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE.  DESSTinEE is a model of the European energy system in 2050 with a focus on the electricity system.  DESSTinEE is being developed primarily at the [[Imperial College Business School]], [[Imperial College London]] (ICL), [[London]], United Kingdom.  The software can be downloaded from the project website.  DESSTinEE is written in [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]/[[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] and comprises a set of standalone [[spreadsheet]]s.  A flier is available.&lt;ref name="desstinee-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

DESSTinEE is designed to investigate assumptions about the technical requirements for energy transport – particularly electricity – and the scale of the economic challenge to develop the necessary infrastructure.  Forty countries are considered in and around Europe and ten forms of primary and secondary energy are supported.  The model uses a predictive simulation technique, rather than solving for either [[Partial equilibrium|partial]] or [[Computable general equilibrium|general equilibrium]].  The model projects annual energy demands for each country to 2050, synthesizes hourly profiles for electricity demand in 2010 and 2050, and simulates the least-cost generation and transmission of electricity around the region.&lt;ref name="openmod-wiki-desstinee"&gt;

A 2016 study using DESSTinEE (and a second model eLOAD) examines the evolution of electricity load curves in Germany and Britain from the present until 2050.  In 2050, peak loads and ramp rates rise 20–60% and system utilization falls 15–20%, in part due to the substantial uptake of [[heat pump]]s and [[electric vehicle]]s.  These are significant changes.&lt;ref name="bossmann-and-staffell-2016"&gt;

The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is an interactive web-based model using a holistic description of a country's energy system.  It is being developed by Quintel Intelligence, [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands.  The project maintains a project website, an interactive website, and a [[GitHub]] repository.  ETM is written in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] (on [[Ruby on Rails|Rails]]) and displays in a [[web browser]].  ETM consists of several software components as described in the documentation.

ETM is fully interactive.  After selecting a region (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom, EU-27, or Brazil) and a year (2020, 2030, 2040, or 2050), the user can set 300 sliders (or enter numerical values) to explore the following:

* targets: set goals for the scenario and see if they can be achieved, targets comprise: {{CO2}} reductions, renewables shares, total cost, and caps on imports 
* demands: expand or restrict energy demand in the future
* costs: project the future costs of energy carriers and energy technologies, these costs do not include taxes or subsidies
* supplies: select which technologies can be used to produce heat or electricity

ETM is based on an energy graph ([[Directed graph|digraph]]) where nodes ([[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]]) can convert from one type of energy to another, possibly with losses.  The connections ([[Glossary of graph theory#edge|directed edges]]) are the energy flows and are characterized by volume (in [[megajoule]]s) and carrier type (such as coal, electricity, usable-heat, and so forth).  Given a demand and other choices, ETM calculates the primary energy use, the total cost, and the resulting {{CO2}} emissions.  The model is demand driven, meaning that the digraph is traversed from ''useful demand'' (such as space heating, hot water usage, and car-kilometers) to ''primary demand'' (the extraction of gas, the import of coal, and so forth).

EnergyPATHWAYS is a bottom-up energy sector model used to explore the near-term implications of long-term deep decarbonization.  The lead developer is energy and climate protection consultancy, Evolved Energy Research, [[San Francisco]], USA.  The code is hosted on [[GitHub]].  EnergyPATHWAYS is written in [[Python (computer language)|Python]] and links to the open source [[COIN-OR#CBC|Cbc]] solver.  Alternatively, the [[GLPK]], [[CPLEX]], or [[Gurobi]] solvers can be employed.  EnergyPATHWAYS utilizes the [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database management system]] (ORDBMS) to manage its [[Data (computing)|data]].

EnergyPATHWAYS is a comprehensive accounting framework used to construct economy-wide energy infrastructure scenarios.  While portions of the model do use [[linear programming]] techniques, for instance, for electricity dispatch, the EnergyPATHWAYS model is not fundamentally an optimization model and embeds few decision dynamics.  EnergyPATHWAYS offers detailed energy, cost, and emissions accounting for the energy flows from primary supply to final demand.  The energy system representation is flexible, allowing for differing levels of detail and the nesting of cities, states, and countries.  The model uses hourly least-cost electricity dispatch and supports [[power-to-gas]], short-duration energy storage, long-duration energy storage, and [[demand response]].  Scenarios typically run to 2050.

A predecessor of the EnergyPATHWAYS software, named simply PATHWAYS, has been used to construct policy models.  The California PATHWAYS model was used to inform Californian state climate targets for 2030.&lt;ref name="williams-etal-2012"&gt;

ETEM is a bottom-up model that identifies the optimal energy and technology options for a regional or city.  The model finds an energy policy with minimal cost, while investing in new equipment (new technologies), developing production capacity (installed technologies), and/or proposing the feasible import/export of primary energy.  ETEM typically casts forward 50{{nbsp}}years, in two or five year steps, with time slices of four seasons using typically individual days or finer.  The spatial resolution can be highly detailed.  Electricity and heat are both supported, as are [[district heating]] networks, household energy systems, and grid storage, including the use of [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).  ETEM-SG, a development, supports [[demand response]], an option which would be enabled by the development of [[smart grid]]s.

The ETEM model has been applied to Luxembourg, the Geneva and Basel-Bern-Zurich cantons in Switzerland, and the Grenoble metropolitan and Midi-Pyrénées region in France.  A 2005 study uses ETEM to study climate protection in the Swiss housing sector.  The ETEM model was coupled with the GEMINI-E3 world [[Computable general equilibrium|computable general equilibrium model]] (CGEM) to complete the analysis.&lt;ref name="drouet-etal-2005"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 study examines the design of [[smart grid]]s.  As distribution systems become more intelligent, so must the models needed to analysis them.  ETEM is used to assess the potential of smart grid technologies using a [[case study]], roughly calibrated on the [[Geneva]] canton, under three scenarios.  These scenarios apply different constraints on {{CO2}} emissions and electricity imports.  A stochastic approach is used to deal with the uncertainty in future electricity prices and the uptake of electric vehicles.&lt;ref name="babonneau-2012"&gt;

ficus is a [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] optimization model for local energy systems.  It is being developed at the [https://www.ewk.ei.tum.de/en/startseite/ Institute for Energy Economy and Application Technology], [[Technical University of Munich]], [[Munich]], Germany.  The project maintains a website.  The project is hosted on [[GitHub]].  ficus is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  The user can choose between the open source [[GLPK]] solver or the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.

Based on [[#URBS|URBS]], ficus was originally developed for optimizing the energy systems of factories and has now been extended to include local energy systems.  ficus supports multiple energy commodities – goods that can be imported or exported, generated, stored, or consumed – including electricity and heat.  It supports multiple-input and multiple-output energy conversion technologies with load-dependent efficiencies.  The objective of the model is to supply the given demand at minimal cost.  ficus uses exogenous cost time series for imported commodities as well as peak demand charges with a configurable timebase for each commodity in use.

Energy systems can be represented using spreadsheets ([[Comma-separated values|CSV]]) which should simplify data preparation.  {{nowrap|Version 0.1.0}} was released on 1{{nbsp}}December 2016.

oemof classes as an energy modeling framework.  It consists of a [[Linear programming|linear]] or [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] optimization problem formulation library (solph), an input data generation library (feedin-data), and other auxiliary libraries.  The solph library is used to represent multi-regional and multi-sectoral (electricity, heat, gas, mobility) systems and can optimize for different targets, such as financial cost or {{CO2}} emissions.  Furthermore, it is possible to switch between dispatch and investment modes.  In terms of scope, oemof can capture the European power system or alternatively it can describe a complex local power and heat sector scheme.

OSeMOSYS stands for Open Source Energy Modelling System.  OSeMOSYS is intended for national and regional policy development and uses an intertemperal optimization framework.  The model posits a single socially motivated operator/investor with perfect foresight.  The OSeMOSYS project is a community endeavor, supported by the Energy Systems Analysis Group (dESA), [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden.  The project maintains a website providing background. The project also offers several active [[internet forum]]s on [[Reddit]].  OSeMOSYS was originally written in [[MathProg]], a high-level [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programming]] language.  It was subsequently reimplemented in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and all three codebases are now maintained.  The project also provides a test model called UTOPIA.&lt;ref name="lavigne-2017"/&gt;  A manual is available.&lt;ref name="moksnes-etal-2015"&gt;

OSeMOSYS provides a framework for the analysis of energy systems over the medium (10–15 years) and long term (50–100 years).  OSeMOSYS uses pure [[Linear programming|linear optimization]], with the option of [[mixed integer programming]] for the treatment of, for instance, discrete power plant capacity expansions.  It covers most energy sectors, including heat, electricity, and transport.  OSeMOSYS is driven by exogenously defined [[Energy system#Energy-services|energy services]] demands.  These are then met through a set of technologies which draw on a set of resources, both characterized by their potentials and costs.  These resources are not limited to energy commodities and may include, for example, water and [[Land use, land-use change and forestry|land-use]].  This enables OSeMOSYS to be applied in domains other than energy, such as water systems.  Technical constraints, economic restrictions, and/or environmental targets may also be imposed to reflect policy considerations.  OSeMOSYS is available in extended and compact MathProg formulations, either of which should give identical results.  In its extended version, OSeMOSYS comprises a little more than 400 [[Source lines of code|lines of code]].

PyPSA stands for Python for Power System Analysis.  PyPSA is a free software toolbox for simulating and optimizing electric power systems and allied sectors.  It supports conventional generation, variable wind and solar generation, electricity storage, [[Power-to-X#Sector coupling concepts|coupling]] to the natural gas, hydrogen, heat, and transport sectors, and hybrid alternating and direct current networks.  Moreover, PyPSA is designed to scale well.  The project is managed by the [https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics] (IAI), [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), [[Karlsruhe]], Germany, although the project itself exists independently under its own name and accounts.  The project maintains a website and runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]].  PyPSA itself is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  The [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]] and is also released periodically as a [[Python Package Index|PyPI]] package.

[[File:Simulated locational marginal prices produced by PyPSA energy system model.svg|thumb|left|Simulated [[Electricity market#Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices|locational marginal prices]] across [[Germany]] under conditions of high wind and low load.  Bottlenecks in north/south power transmission elicit the large differences.&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-pypsa"/&gt;{{rp|11}}]]

The basic functionality of PyPSA is described in a 2018 paper.  PyPSA sits between traditional steady-state power flow analysis software and full multi-period energy system models.  It can be invoked using either non-linear power flow equations for system simulation or linearized approximations to enable the joint optimization of operations and investment across multiple periods.  Generator ramping and multi-period up and down-times can be specified, [[demand side management|DSM]] is supported, but demand remains [[price elasticity of demand|price inelastic]].&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-pypsa"&gt;

A 2018 study examines potential synergies between [[power-to-X#sector coupling concepts|sector coupling]] and [[electric power transmission|transmission]] reinforcement in a future European energy system constrained to reduce [[carbon dioxide equivalent|carbon]] emissions by 95%.  The PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30 model captures the [[energy demand management|demand-side management]] potential of [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV) as well as the role that [[power-to-gas]], long-term [[thermal energy storage]], and related technologies can play.  Results indicate that BEVs can smooth the daily variations in solar power while the remaining technologies smooth the [[wiktionary:synoptic|synoptic]] and seasonal variations in both demand and renewable supply.  Substantial [[wiktionary:buildout|buildout]] of the electricity grid is required for a least-cost configuration.  More generally, such a system is both feasible and affordable.  The underlying datasets are available from [[Zenodo]].&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-synergies"&gt;

TEMOA can be used with any solver that [[Pyomo]] supports, including the open source [[GLPK]] solver.  TEMOA uses [[version control]] to publicly archive [[source code]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] and thereby enable third-parties to verify all published modeling work.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

TEMOA classes as a modeling framework and is used to conduct analysis using a bottom-up, technology rich energy system model.  The model objective is to minimize the system-wide cost of energy supply by deploying and utilizing energy technologies and commodities over time to meet a set of [[wiktionary:exogenous|exogenously]] specified end-use demands.&lt;ref name="hunter-etal-2013"&gt;

== Programming components ==

=== Component models ===

A number of technical component models are now also open source.  While these component models do not constitute systems models aimed at public policy development (the focus of this page), they nonetheless warrant a mention.  Component models can be linked or otherwise adapted into these broader initiatives.

A number of electricity auction models have been written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]], [[AMPL]], [[MathProg]], and other languages.{{efn|
[[MathProg]] is a subset of [[AMPL]].  It is sometimes possible to convert an AMPL model into MathProg without much effort.

=== Open solvers ===

Many projects rely on a [[Linear programming|pure linear]] or [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] solver to perform classical optimization, constraint satisfaction, or some mix of the two.  While there are several open source solver projects, the most commonly deployed solver is [[GLPK]].  GLPK has been adopted by [[#Calliope|Calliope]], [[#ETEM|ETEM]], [[#ficus|ficus]], [[#OSeMOSYS|OSeMOSYS]], [[#SWITCH|SWITCH]], and [[#TEMOA|TEMOA]].  Another alternative is the Clp solver.&lt;ref name="clp-homepage"&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Proprietary solvers outperform open source solvers by a considerable margin (perhaps ten-fold), so choosing an open solver will limit performance in terms of both speed and memory consumption.&lt;ref name="koch-etal-2011"&gt;

A '''percentage point''' or '''percent point''' is the [[unit (measurement)|unit]] for the [[Difference (mathematics)|arithmetic difference]] of two [[percentage]]s. For example, moving up from 40% to 44% is a 4 ''percentage point'' increase, but is an actual 10 percent increase in what is being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brechner |first=Robert |date=2008 |title=Contemporary Mathematics for Business and Consumers, Brief Edition |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jSsHAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=percentage%20points&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q=percentage%20points&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=190 |access-date=7 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518123546/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jSsHAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=percentage%20points&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q=percentage%20points&amp;f=false |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= |isbn=9781111805500 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the literature, the percentage point unit is usually either written out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wickham |first=Kathleen |date=2003 |title=Math Tools for Journalists |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RYtYmMD2ReAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=textbook%20mathematics%20%22percentage%20points%22&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=points&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=30 |access-date=7 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518123538/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RYtYmMD2ReAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=textbook%20mathematics%20%22percentage%20points%22&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=points&amp;f=false |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= |isbn=9780972993746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or abbreviated as ''pp'' or ''p.p.'' to avoid ambiguity. After the first occurrence, some writers abbreviate by using just "point" or "points".

Consider the following hypothetical example: In 1980, 50 percent of the population smoked, and in 1990 only 40 percent smoked. One can thus say that from 1980 to 1990, the prevalence of smoking decreased by 10 ''percentage points'' although smoking did not decrease by 10 percent (it decreased by ''20 percent'') – percentages indicate ratios, not differences.

Percentage-point differences are one way to express a risk or [[probabilities|probability]]. Consider a drug that cures a given disease in 70 percent of all cases, while without the drug, the disease heals spontaneously in only 50 percent of cases. The drug reduces absolute risk by 20 percentage points. Alternatives may be more meaningful to consumers of statistics, such as the  [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]], also known as the [[number needed to treat]] (NNT). In this case, the reciprocal transform of the percentage-point difference would be 1/(20pp) = 1/0.20 = 5. Thus if 5 patients are treated with the drug, one could expect to heal one more case of the disease than would have occurred in the absence of the drug.

For measurements involving percentages as a unit, such as, growth, [[yield (finance)|yield]], or [[ejection fraction]], [[statistical deviation]]s and related [[descriptive statistics]], including the [[standard deviation]] and [[root-mean-square error]], the result should be expressed in units of percentage points instead of percentage. Mistakenly using percentage as the unit for the standard deviation is confusing, since percentage is also used as a unit for the [[relative standard deviation]], i.e. standard deviation divided by average value ([[coefficient of variation]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5420">In [[Bayesian inference]], '''plate notation''' is a method of representing variables that repeat in a [[graphical model]].  Instead of drawing each repeated variable individually, a plate or rectangle is used to group variables into a subgraph that repeat together, and a number is drawn on the plate to represent the number of repetitions of the subgraph in the plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech

==Example==
[[Image:Latent Dirichlet allocation.svg|thumb|right|300px|Plate notation for [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]]]]

In this example, we consider [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]], a [[Bayesian network]] that models how documents in a corpus are topically related.  There are two variables not in any plate; ''α'' is the parameter of the uniform [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet]] prior on the per-document topic distributions, and ''β'' is the parameter of the uniform Dirichlet prior on the per-topic word distribution.

The outermost plate represents all the variables related to a specific document, including &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;, the topic distribution for document ''i''.  The ''M'' in the corner of the plate indicates that the variables inside are repeated ''M'' times, once for each document.  The inner plate represents the variables associated with each of the &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; words in document ''i'': &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the topic for the ''j''th word in document ''i'', and &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the actual word used.

The ''N'' in the corner represents the repetition of the variables in the inner plate &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; times, once for each word in document ''i''.  The circle representing the individual words is shaded, indicating that each &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is [[observable variable|observable]], and the other circles are empty, indicating that the other variables are [[latent variable]]s.  The directed edges between variables indicate dependencies between the variables: for example, each &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and ''β''.

{{clear}}

==Extensions==
[[File:bayesian-gaussian-mixture-vb.svg|right|300px|thumb|Bayesian [[multivariate normal distribution|multivariate Gaussian]] [[mixture model]] using plate notation.  Smaller squares indicate fixed parameters; larger circles indicate random variables.  Filled-in shapes indicate known values.  The indication [K] means a vector of size ''K''; [D,D] means a matrix of size ''D''&amp;times;''D''; K alone means a [[categorical variable]] with ''K'' outcomes.  The squiggly line coming from ''z'' ending in a crossbar indicates a ''switch'' — the value of this variable selects, for the other incoming variables, which value to use out of the size-''K'' array of possible values.]]

A number of extensions have been created by various authors to express more information than simply the conditional relationships.  However, few of these have become standard.  Perhaps the most commonly used extension is to use rectangles in place of circles to indicate non-random variables—either parameters to be computed, [[hyperparameter]]s given a fixed value (or computed through [[empirical Bayes]]), or variables whose values are computed deterministically from a random variable.

The diagram on the right shows a few more non-standard conventions used in some articles in Wikipedia (e.g. [[variational Bayes]]):
*Variables that are actually [[random vector]]s are indicated by putting the vector size in brackets in the middle of the node.
*Variables that are actually [[random matrices]] are similarly indicated by putting the matrix size in brackets in the middle of the node, with commas separating row size from column size.
*[[Categorical variable]]s are indicated by placing their size (without a bracket) in the middle of the node.
*Categorical variables that act as "switches", and which pick one or more other random variables to condition on from a large set of such variables (e.g. mixture components), are indicated with a special type of arrow containing a squiggly line and ending in a T junction.
*Boldface is consistently used for vector or matrix nodes (but not categorical nodes).

==Software implementation==
Plate notation has been implemented in various [[TeX]]/[[LaTeX]] drawing packages, but also as part of graphical user interfaces to Bayesian statistics programs such as [[Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling|BUGS]] and [[BayesiaLab]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1778">A '''procept''' is an amalgam of three components: a '''process''' which produces a mathematical '''object''' and a '''symbol''' which is used to represent either process or object. It derives from the work of Eddie Gray and [[David O. Tall]], and is a much used construct in [[mathematics education]] research.

The notion was first published in a paper in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051025030243/http://my.nctm.org/eresources/journal_home.asp?journal_id=1 Journal for Research in Mathematics Education] in 1994, and is part of the process-object literature. This body of literature suggests that mathematical objects are formed by encapsulating processes, that is to say that the mathematical object 3 is formed by an encapsulation of the process of counting: 1,2,3...

Gray &amp; Tall's notion of procept improved upon the existing literature by noting that [[mathematical notation]] is often ambiguous as to whether it refers to process or object. Examples of such notations are:

:&lt;math&gt;3+4&lt;/math&gt; : refers to the process of adding as well as the outcome of the process.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; : refers to the process of summing an infinite sequence, and to the outcome of the process.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x+2&lt;/math&gt; : refers to the process of mapping x to 3x+2 as well as the outcome of that process, the function f(x).

A '''quantitative analyst''' (or, in financial jargon, a '''quant''') is a person who specializes in the application of mathematical and statistical methods – such as numerical or quantitative techniques – to financial and risk management problems.  The occupation is similar to those in [[industrial mathematics]] in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;See Definition in the Society for Applied and Industrial Mathematics http://www.siam.org/about/pdf/brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the original quantitative analysts were "[[sell side]] quants" from market maker firms, concerned with [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] pricing and [[risk management]], the meaning of the term has expanded over time to include those individuals involved in almost any application of [[mathematical finance|mathematics in finance]], including the [[buy side]].&lt;ref&gt;Derman, E. (2004). My life as a quant: reflections on physics and finance. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[statistical arbitrage]], quantitative [[investment management]], [[algorithmic trading]],  and electronic market making. 

==History==
[[File:Robert C. Merton.jpg|thumb|[[Robert C. Merton]], one of the pioneers of quantitative analysis, promoted [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.]]
[[Quantitative finance]] started in 1900 with [[Louis Bachelier]]'s doctoral thesis ''Theory of Speculation'', which provided a model to price [[Option (finance)|options]] under a [[Normal Distribution]].

[[Harry Markowitz]]'s 1952 doctoral [[thesis]] "Portfolio Selection" and its published version was one of the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance (mathematics was until then confined to mathematics, statistics or specialized economics journals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markowitz |first=H. |year=1952 |title=Portfolio Selection |journal=[[Journal of Finance]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=77–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of "diversification" in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors should hold only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return.  Although the language of finance now involves [[Itō calculus]], management of risk in a quantifiable manner underlies much of the modern theory.

In 1965 [[Paul Samuelson]] introduced [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=P. A. |year=1965 |title=Rational Theory of Warrant Pricing |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=13–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry McKean]] the co-founder of stochastic calculus (along with [[Kiyosi Itô]]) wrote the appendix: see {{cite journal |last=McKean |first=H. P. Jr. |year=1965 |title=Appendix (to Samuelson): a free boundary problem for the heat equation arising from a problem of mathematical economics |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=32–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]] promoted continuous stochastic calculus and [[continuous-time]] processes. Merton was motivated by the desire to understand how prices are set in financial markets, which is the classical economics question of "equilibrium," and in later papers he used the machinery of stochastic calculus to begin investigation of this issue.

At the same time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]] developed the [[Black–Scholes model]], which was awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].  It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock at a specified price and time.  Such options are frequently purchased by investors as a risk-hedging device. In 1981, Harrison and Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to put the [[Black–Scholes]] model on a solid theoretical basis, and showed how to price numerous other derivative securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrison |first=J. Michael |last2=Pliska |first2=Stanley R. |title=Martingales and Stochastic Integrals in the Theory of Continuous Trading |journal=Stochastic Processes and their Applications |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=215–260 |year=1981 |doi=10.1016/0304-4149(81)90026-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Derman]]'s 2004 book ''My Life as a Quant'' helped to both make the role of a quantitative analyst better known outside of finance, and to popularize the abbreviation "quant" for a quantitative analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derman |first=Emanuel |year=2004 |title=My Life as a Quant |publisher=John Wiley and Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Quantitative analysts often come from applied mathematics, physics or engineering backgrounds rather than economics-related fields, and quantitative analysis is a major source of employment for people with mathematics and physics PhD degrees, or with financial mathematics [[Diplôme d'études approfondies|DEA]] degrees in the French education system.  Typically, a quantitative analyst will also need extensive skills in computer programming, most commonly [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[MATLAB]], [[Mathematica]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

This demand for quantitative analysts has led to a resurgence in demand for [[actuarial]] qualifications as well as creation of specialized Masters and PhD courses in [[financial engineering]], [[mathematical finance]], [[computational finance]], and/or [[financial reinsurance]].  In particular, Master's degrees in [[mathematical finance]], [[financial engineering]], [[operations research]], [[computational statistics]], [[machine Learning|machine learning]], and [[financial analysis]] are becoming more popular with students and with employers. See [[Master of Quantitative Finance]]; [[Master of Financial Economics]].

[[Data science]] and [[machine learning]] analysis and modelling methods are being increasingly employed in portfolio performance and portfolio risk modelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketsmedia.com/machine-learning-in-finance-theory-and-applications/|title=Machine Learning in Finance: Theory and Applications|author=|date=22 January 2013|website=marketsmedia.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qminitiative.org/UserFiles/files/S_Cl%C3%A9men%C3%A7on_ML.pdf|title=A Machine-Learning View of Quantitative Finance|author=|date=|website=qminitiative.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such data science and machine learning Master's graduates are also in demand as quantitative analysts.

==Types==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

===Front office quantitative analyst===
In sales &amp; trading, quantitative analysts work to determine prices, manage risk, and identify profitable opportunities. Historically this was a distinct activity from trading but the boundary between a desk quantitative analyst and a quantitative trader is increasingly blurred, and it is now difficult to enter trading as a profession without at least some quantitative analysis education. In the field of [[algorithmic trading]] it has reached the point where there is little meaningful difference. Front office work favours a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling. FOQs typically are significantly better paid than those in back office, risk, and model validation. Although highly skilled analysts, FOQs frequently lack software engineering experience or formal training, and bound by time constraints and business pressures tactical solutions are often adopted.

===Quantitative investment management===
Quantitative analysis is used extensively by asset managers. Some, such as FQ, AQR or Barclays, rely almost exclusively on quantitative strategies while others, such as Pimco, Blackrock or Citadel use a mix of quantitative and fundamental methods.

===Library quantitative analysis===
Major firms invest large sums in an attempt to produce standard methods of evaluating prices and risk. These differ from front office tools in that Excel is very rare, with most development being in C++, though Java and C# are sometimes used in non-performance critical tasks. LQs spend more time modeling ensuring the analytics are both efficient and correct, though there is tension between LQs and FOQs on the validity of their results. LQs are required to understand techniques such as [[Monte Carlo methods]] and [[finite difference methods]], as well as the nature of the products being modeled.

===Algorithmic trading quantitative analyst===
Often the highest paid form of Quant, ATQs make use of methods taken from [[signal processing]], [[game theory]], gambling [[Kelly criterion]], [[market microstructure]], [[econometrics]], and [[time series]] analysis. [[Algorithmic trading]] includes [[statistical arbitrage]], but includes techniques largely based upon speed of response, to the extent that some ATQs modify hardware and Linux kernels to achieve ultra low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]].

===Risk management===
This has grown in importance in recent years, as the credit crisis exposed holes in the mechanisms used to ensure that positions were correctly hedged, though in no bank does the pay in risk approach that in front office. A core technique is [[value at risk]], and this is backed up with various forms of [[stress test (financial)]], [[economic capital]] analysis and direct analysis of the positions and models used by various bank's divisions.

===Innovation===
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there surfaced the recognition that quantitative valuation methods were generally too narrow in their approach. An agreed upon fix adopted by numerous financial institutions has been to improve collaboration.

===Model validation===
Model validation (MV) takes the models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group might well be seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.

===Quantitative developer===
Quantitative developers are computer specialists that assist, implement and maintain the quantitative models. They tend to be highly specialised language technicians that bridge the gap between software developer and quantitative analysts.

==Mathematical and statistical approaches==
Because of their backgrounds, quantitative analysts draw from various forms of mathematics: [[statistics]] and [[probability]], [[calculus]] centered around [[partial differential equation]]s, [[linear algebra]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[econometrics]]. Some on the buy side may use [[machine learning]]. The
majority of quantitative analysts have received little formal education in mainstream economics, and often apply a mindset drawn from the physical sciences. Quants use mathematical skills learned from diverse fields such as computer science, physics and engineering. These skills include (but are not limited to) advanced statistics,  linear algebra and partial differential equations as well as solutions to these based upon [[numerical analysis]].

Commonly used numerical methods are:
* [[Finite difference method]] &amp;ndash; used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s;
* [[Monte Carlo method]] &amp;ndash; Also used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s, but [[Monte Carlo simulation]] is also common in risk management;
* [[Ordinary least squares]] &amp;ndash; used to estimate parameters in [[regression analysis|statistical regression analysis]];
* [[Spline interpolation]] &amp;ndash; used to interpolate values from [[yield curve|spot and forward interest rates curves]], and [[volatility smile]]s;
* [[Bisection method|Bisection]], [[Newton method|Newton]], and [[Secant method]]s &amp;ndash; used to find the [[root of a function|roots]], [[maxima and minima]] of functions (e.g. [[internal rate of return]].)

==Techniques==
A typical problem for a mathematically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for pricing, hedging, and risk-managing a complex derivative product. These quantitative analysts tend to rely more on numerical analysis than statistics and econometrics. The mindset is to prefer a deterministically "correct" answer, as once there is agreement on input values and market variable dynamics, there is only [[law of one price|one correct price]] for any given security (which can be demonstrated, albeit often inefficiently, through a large volume of Monte Carlo simulations).

A typical problem for a statistically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for deciding which stocks are relatively expensive and which stocks are relatively cheap. The model might include a company's book value to price ratio, its trailing earnings to price ratio, and other accounting factors. An investment manager might implement this analysis by buying the underpriced stocks, selling the overpriced stocks, or both. Statistically oriented quantitative analysts tend to have more of a reliance on statistics and econometrics, and less of a reliance on sophisticated numerical techniques and object-oriented programming. These quantitative analysts tend to be of the psychology that enjoys trying to find the best approach to modeling data, and can accept that there is no "right answer" until time has passed and we can retrospectively see how the model performed. Both types of quantitative analysts demand a strong knowledge of sophisticated mathematics and computer programming proficiency.

One of the principal mathematical tools of quantitative finance is [[stochastic calculus]].

'''Quasi-empirical methods''' are [[methodology|methods]] applied in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] to achieve [[epistemology]] similar to that of [[empiricism]] (thus ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]] + empirical'') when [[experience]] cannot [[falsifiability|falsify]] the ideas involved. [[Empirical research]] relies on [[empirical evidence]], and its empirical methods involve [[experiment]]ation and disclosure of apparatus for [[reproducibility]], by which scientific findings are [[verification and validation|validated]] by other scientists. Empirical methods are studied extensively in the [[philosophy of science]], but they cannot be used directly in fields whose hypotheses cannot be falsified by real experiment (for example, [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[ideology]]). Because of such [[empirical limits in science]], the [[scientific method]] must rely not only on empirical methods but sometimes also on quasi-empirical ones. The prefix ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]]'' came to denote methods that are "almost" or "socially approximate" an ideal of truly empirical methods.

It is unnecessary to find all counterexamples to a theory; all that is required to disprove a theory logically is one counterexample. The converse does not prove a theory; [[Bayesian inference]] simply makes a theory more likely, by weight of evidence.

One can argue that no science is capable of finding all counter-examples to a theory, therefore, no science is strictly empirical, it's all quasi-empirical. But usually, the term "quasi-empirical" refers to the means of choosing problems to focus on (or ignore), selecting prior work on which to build an argument or proof, notations for informal claims, peer review and acceptance, and incentives to discover, ignore, or correct errors.  These are common to both [[science]] and [[mathematics]], and do not include experimental method.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s discovery of the [[general relativity]] theory relied upon [[thought experiments]] and [[mathematics]]. Empirical methods only became relevant when confirmation was sought. Furthermore, some empirical confirmation was found only some time after the general acceptance of the theory.

Thought experiments are almost standard procedure in [[philosophy]], where a conjecture is tested out in the imagination for possible effects on experience; when these are thought to be implausible,  unlikely to occur, or not actually occurring, then the conjecture may be either rejected or amended.  [[Logical positivism]] was a perhaps extreme version of this practice, though this claim is open to debate.

Post-20th-century [[philosophy of mathematics]] is mostly concerned with [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical mathematical methods]], especially as reflected in the actual [[mathematical practice]] of working mathematicians.

'''SAMPL''', which stands for '''"Stochastic [[AMPL]]"''', is an [[algebraic modeling language]] resulting by expanding the well-known language [[AMPL]] with extended syntax and keywords. It is designed specifically for representing [[stochastic programming]] problems&lt;ref name="ExtendingAlgebraicLanguages"&gt;
{{cite journal | author=Christian Valente, Gautam Mitra, Mustapha Sadki and Robert Fourer| title=Extending algebraic modelling languages for stochastic programming| journal=INFORMS Journal on Computing| year=2009| volume=21| issue=1| pages=107–122| url=http://joc.journal.informs.org/content/21/1/107.abstract| doi=10.1287/ijoc.1080.0282}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and, through recent extensions, problems with chance constraints, integrated chance constraints and [[robust optimization]] problems. 
It can generate the deterministic equivalent version of the instances, using all the solvers AMPL connects to,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ampl.com/solvers.html&lt;/ref&gt; or generate an [[MPS (format)#extensions|SMPS]] representation and use specialized decomposition based solvers, like [[FortSP]].

== Language Features ==

SAMPL shares all language features with AMPL, and adds some constructs specifically designed for expressing scenario based [[stochastic programming]] and [[robust optimization]].

=== Stochastic programming features and constructs ===

To express scenario-based SP problems, additional constructs describe the tree structure and group the decision variable into stages. Moreover, it is possible to specify which parameter stores the probabilities for each branch of the tree and which set represents the scenario set. Other constructs to easily define chance constraints and integrated chance constraint in an SP problem are available as well.
Using these language constructs allows to retain the structure of the problem, hence making it available to the solvers, which might exploit it using specialized decomposition methods like [[Benders' decomposition]] to speed-up the solution.

=== Robust optimization constructs ===

SAMPL supports constructs to describe three types of robust optimization formulations:

== Availability ==

SAMPL is currently available as a part of the software AMPLDev (distributed by [http://www.optirisk-systems.com www.optirisk-systems.com]). It supports many popular 32- and 64-bit platforms including [[Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]]. A free evaluation version with limited functionality is available.&lt;ref&gt;http://optirisk-systems.com/products_ampldevSP.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

It does not include the data file, which follows the normal AMPL syntax (see the [[AMPL#example|example]] provided in the AMPL Wikipedia page for further reference).

 sales{p in Prod, s in Scen}: amountsell[p,s] &lt;= Demand[p,s];
 ''# Respect initial budget''
 budgetres: sum{r in Resource} Cost[r] * buy[r] &lt;= Budget;

== Solvers connectivity ==

SAMPL instance level format for SP problems is SMPS, and therefore the problem can be solved by any solver which supports that standard. One of such solvers (FortSP) is included in the standard SAMPL distribution. Regarding robust optimization problems, the needed solver depend on the specific formulation used, as Ben-Tal and Nemirovski formulation need a [[Second-order cone programming|second-order cone]] capable solver.

[[File:Abax from Darius Vase.jpg|thumb|Abax depicted on the [[Darius Vase]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Michael R.|title=A history of computing technology|year=1998|publisher=IEEE Computer Soc.|location=Los Alamitos, Calif.|isbn=978-0-8186-7739-7|page=56|edition=2nd ed., 2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

A '''sand table''' uses constrained sand for modelling or educational purposes. The original version of a sand table may be the abax used by early Greek students. In the modern era, one common use for a sand table is to make terrain models for [[military plan]]ning and [[wargaming]].

==Abax==
An abax was a table covered with sand commonly used by students, particularly in Greece, to perform studies such as writing, geometry, and calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1958:177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

An abax was the predecessor to the [[abacus]]. Objects, such as stones, were added for counting and then columns for place-valued arithmetic. The demarcation between an abax and an abacus seems to be poorly defined in history;&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah 2000:125–126 and others&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, modern definitions of the word ''abacus'' universally describe it as a frame with rods and beads&lt;ref&gt;See American Heritage definition of "abacus" in External Links below&lt;/ref&gt; and, in general, do not include the definition of "sand table".

The sand table may well have been the predecessor to some [[board games]]. ("The word abax, or abacus, is used both for the reckoning-board with its counters and the play-board with its pieces, ...").&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1879:28&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abax'' is from the [[Old Greek#Evolution from Ancient to Modern Greek|old Greek]] for "sand table".&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage:abacus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghubar==
An Arabic word for sand (or dust) is ''ghubar'' (or ''gubar''), and Western numerals (the [[decimal]] digits 0&amp;ndash;9) are derived from the style of digits written on ''ghubar'' tables in North-West Africa and Iberia, also described as the 'West Arabic' or 'gubar' style.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J. J.,  and E. F. Robertson, ''The Arabic numeral system http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use==
[[File:Marine table2.gif|thumb|Marines view a sand table model  of the operating area of [[Exercise Desert Punch]] constructed on the desert floor near [[Yuma, Arizona]].]]
Sand tables have been used for [[military plan]]ning and [[wargaming]] for many years as a field expedient, [[Scale (map)|small-scale map]], and in [[Military training|training]] for [[Battle|military actions]]. In 1890 a Sand table room was built at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] for use in teaching cadets military tactics; this replaced the old sand table room in a pre-college building, in which the weight of the sand had damaged the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Preston `Canada`s RMC: A History of the Royal Military College` (University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sand tables increasingly fell out of favour with improved maps, aerial and satellite photography, and later, with digital terrain simulations. More modern sand tables have incorporated [[Augmented reality|Augmented Reality]], such as the [[Augmented Reality Sandtable (ARES)]] developed by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/yp5w8y/the-armys-new-projection-mapped-sandtable|title=Design Digital Terrain with the Army's Projection-Mapped Sandtable|last=Mufson|first=Beckett|date=November 5, 2014|work=Vice Creators|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, virtual and conventional sand tables are used in operations training.

In 1991, "Special Forces teams discovered an elaborate sand-table model of the Iraqi military plan for the defense of Kuwait City. Four huge red arrows from the sea pointed at the coastline of Kuwait City and the huge defensive effort positioned there. Small fences of concertina wire marked the shoreline and models of artillery pieces lined the shore area. Throughout the city were plastic models of other artillery and air defense positions, while thin, red-painted strips of board designated supply routes and main highways."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/timeline/022891.htm Arab Forces, Marines Take Kuwait City]'' – ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 28 February 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Google Earth]] users looking at satellite photography of China found a several ''kilometre'' large "sand table" scale model, strikingly reminiscent of a mountainous region ([[Aksai Chin]]) which China occupies militarily in a disputed zone with India, 2400&amp;nbsp;km from the model's location. Speculation has been rife that the terrain is used for military exercises of familiarisation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/chinese-xfile-excites-spotters/2006/07/20/1153166503699.html Chinese X-file excites spotters]'' – ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 20 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/from-sky-see-how-china-builds-model-of-indian-border-2400-km-away/9972/ From sky, see how China builds model of Indian border 2400 km away]'' – ''[[indianexpress.com]]'', 4 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG)''' was an American academic [[think tank]] focused on the subject of reform in [[mathematics education]].  Directed by [[Edward G. Begle]] and financed by the [[National Science Foundation]], the group was created in the wake of the [[Sputnik crisis]] in 1958 and tasked with creating and implementing [[mathematics]] [[curriculum|curricula]] for [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], which it did until its termination in 1977.  The efforts of the SMSG yielded a reform in mathematics education known as [[New Math]] which was promulgated in a series of reports, culminating in a series published by [[Random House]] called the ''New Mathematical Library''.  In the early years, SMSG also produced a set of draft textbooks in typewritten paperback format for elementary, middle and high school students. 

Perhaps the most authoritative collection of materials from the School Mathematics Study Group is now housed in the [[Archives of American Mathematics]] in the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s Center for American History.

In [[logic]], the '''scope''' of a [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] or a quantification is the range in the [[Well-formed formula#Predicate logic|formula]] where the quantifier "engages in". It is put right after the quantifier, often in parentheses. Some authors describe this as including the variable put right after the forall or exists symbol. In the formula {{math|∀''xP''}}, for example, {{math|''P''}} (or {{math|''xP''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=John L.|authorlink1=John Lane Bell|last2=Machover|first2=Moshé|authorlink2=Moshé Machover|title=A Course in Mathematical Logic|date=April 15, 2007|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd|isbn=978-0-7204-2844-5|page=17|chapter=Chapter 1. Beginning mathematical logic}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the scope of the quantifier {{math|∀''x''}} (or {{math|∀}}).

A variable in the formula is [[free variable|free]], if and only if it does not occur in the scope of any quantifier for that variable. A [[term (logic)|term]] is free for a variable in the formula (i.e. free to substitute that variable that occurs free), if and only if that variable does not occur free in the scope of any quantifier for any variable in the term.

The degrees of self-dissimilarity between the [[pattern recognition|patterns]] of a [[system theory|system]] observed at various [[scale factor|scale]]s (e.g. the average [[matter density]] of a physical body for [[volume]]s at different [[orders of magnitude]]) constitute a complexity "signature" of that system.

When extending the concept of line to the [[line at infinity]], a set of '''parallel planes''' can be seen as a ''sheaf of planes'' intersecting in a ''line at infinity''.

In [[mathematics]], '''transport of structure''' is the definition of a new structure on an object by reference to another object on which a similar structure already exists. Definitions by transport of structure are regarded as canonical.

Since mathematical structures are often defined in reference to an underlying [[space (mathematics)|space]], many examples of transport of structure involve spaces and mappings between them.  For example, if ''V'' and ''W'' are [[vector space]]s, and if &lt;math&gt;\phi \colon V \to W&lt;/math&gt; is an [[isomorphism]], and if &lt;math&gt;(\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[inner product]] on &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, then we can define an inner product &lt;math&gt;[\cdot, \cdot]&lt;/math&gt; on ''V'' by
:&lt;math&gt;[v_1, v_2] = (\phi(v_1), \phi(v_2))&lt;/math&gt;.
Although the equation makes sense even when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is not an isomorphism, it only defines an inner product on ''V'' when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is, since otherwise it will cause &lt;math&gt;[\cdot,\cdot]&lt;/math&gt; to be [[degenerate bilinear form|degenerate]].  The idea is that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; allows us to consider ''V'' and ''W'' as "the same" vector space, and if we follow this analogy, we can transport an inner product from one to the other.

A more involved example comes from [[differential topology]], in which we have the notion of a [[smooth manifold]].  If ''M'' is such a manifold, and if ''X'' is any topological space which is [[homeomorphic]] to ''M'', we can consider ''X'' as a smooth manifold as well.  That is, let &lt;math&gt;\phi \colon X \to M&lt;/math&gt; be a homeomorphism; we must define coordinate charts on ''X'', which we will do by "pulling back" coordinate charts on ''M'' through &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  Recall that a coordinate chart on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an open set ''U'' together with an [[injective map]]
:&lt;math&gt;c \colon U \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''n''; to get such a chart on ''X'', we let
:&lt;math&gt;U' = \phi^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c' = c \circ \phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Furthermore, it is required that the charts cover ''M'', we must check that the transported charts cover ''X'', which follows immediately from the fact that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[bijection]].  Finally, since ''M'' is a ''smooth'' manifold, we have that if ''U'' and ''V'', with their maps
:&lt;math&gt;c \colon U \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d \colon V \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;,
are two charts on ''M'', then the composition, the "transition map"
:&lt;math&gt;d \circ c^{-1} \colon c(U \cap V) \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (a self-map of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;)
is smooth.  We must check this for our transported charts on ''X''.  We have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(U) \cap \phi^{-1}(V) = \phi^{-1}(U \cap V)&lt;/math&gt;,
and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;c'(U' \cap V') = (c \circ \phi)(\phi^{-1}(U \cap V)) = c(U \cap V)&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;d' \circ (c')^{-1} = (d \circ \phi) \circ (c \circ \phi)^{-1} = d \circ (\phi \circ \phi^{-1}) \circ c^{-1} = d \circ c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore the transition map for &lt;math&gt;U'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is the same as that for ''U'' and ''V'', hence smooth.  Therefore ''X'' is a smooth manifold via transport of structure.

Although the second example involved considerably more checking, the principle was the same, and any experienced mathematician would have no difficulty performing the necessary verifications.  Therefore when such an operation is indicated, it is invoked merely as "transport of structure" and the details left to the reader, if desired.

The second example also illustrates why "transport of structure" is not always desirable.  Namely, we can take ''M'' to be the plane, and we can take ''X'' to be an infinite one-sided cone.  By "flattening" the cone we achieve a homeomorphism of ''X'' and ''M'', and therefore the structure of a smooth manifold on ''X'', but the cone is not "naturally" a smooth manifold.  That is, we can consider ''X'' as a subspace of 3-space, in which context it is not smooth at the cone point.  A more surprising example is that of [[exotic sphere]]s, discovered by [[Milnor]], which states that there are exactly 28 smooth manifolds which are homeomorphic (but by definition ''not'' diffeomorphic) to &lt;math&gt;S^7&lt;/math&gt;, the 7-dimensional sphere in 8-space.  Thus, transport of structure is most productive when there exists a [[canonical form|canonical]] isomorphism between the two objects.

There have been several attempts in history to reach a '''unified theory of mathematics'''. Some of the greatest [[mathematician]]s have expressed views that the whole subject should be fitted into one theory.

==Historical perspective==

The process of unification might be seen as helping to define what constitutes mathematics as a discipline.

For example, [[mechanics]] and [[mathematical analysis]] were commonly combined into one subject during the 18th century, united by the [[differential equation]] concept; while [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] were considered largely distinct. Now we consider analysis, algebra, and geometry, but not mechanics, as parts of mathematics because they are primarily deductive [[formal science]]s, while mechanics like [[physics]] must proceed from observation. There is no major loss of content, with [[analytical mechanics]] in the old sense now expressed in terms of [[symplectic topology]], based on the newer theory of [[manifold]]s.

==Mathematical theories==

The term ''theory'' is used informally within mathematics to mean a self-consistent body of [[definition]]s, [[axiom]]s, [[theorem]]s, examples, and so on. (Examples include [[group theory]], [[Galois theory]], [[control theory]], and [[K-theory]].) In particular there is no connotation of ''hypothetical''. Thus the term ''unifying theory'' is more like a [[sociological]] term used to study the actions of mathematicians. It may assume nothing conjectural that would be analogous to an undiscovered scientific link. There is really no cognate within mathematics to such concepts as ''[[Proto-World language|Proto-World]]'' in [[linguistics]] or the [[Gaia hypothesis]].

Nonetheless there have been several episodes within the history of mathematics in which sets of individual theorems were found to be special cases of a single unifying result, or in which a single perspective about how to proceed when developing an area of mathematics could be applied fruitfully to multiple branches of the subject.

==Geometrical theories==

A well-known example was the development of [[analytic geometry]], which in the hands of mathematicians such as [[Descartes]] and [[Fermat]] showed that many theorems about [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s of special types could be stated in algebraic language (then new), each of which could then be proved using the same techniques. That is, the theorems were very similar algebraically, even if the geometrical interpretations were distinct.

In 1859 [[Arthur Cayley]] initiated a unification of [[metric geometry|metric geometries]] through use of the [[Cayley-Klein metric]]s. Later [[Felix Klein]] used such metrics to provide a foundation for [[non-Euclidean geometry]].

In 1872, Felix Klein noted that the many branches of geometry which had been developed during the 19th century ([[affine geometry]], [[projective geometry]], [[hyperbolic geometry]], etc.) could all be treated in a uniform way. He did this by considering the [[group theory|group]]s under which the geometric objects were invariant. This unification of geometry goes by the name of the [[Erlangen programme]].

==Through-axiomatisation==

Early in the 20th century, many parts of mathematics began to be treated by delineating useful sets of axioms and then studying their consequences. Thus, for example, the studies of "[[hypercomplex number]]s", such as considered by the [[Quaternion Society]], were put onto an axiomatic footing as branches of [[ring theory]] (in this case, with the specific meaning of [[associative algebra]]s over the field of complex numbers.) In this context, the [[quotient ring]] concept is one of the most powerful unifiers.

This was a general change of methodology, since the needs of applications had up until then meant that much of mathematics was taught by means of [[algorithm]]s (or processes close to being algorithmic). [[Arithmetic]] is still taught that way. It was a parallel to the development of [[mathematical logic]] as a stand-alone branch of mathematics. By the 1930s [[symbolic logic]] itself was adequately included within mathematics.

In most cases, mathematical objects under study can be defined (albeit non-canonically) as sets or, more informally, as sets with additional structure such as an addition operation. [[Set theory]] now serves as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' for the development of mathematical themes.

==Bourbaki==

The cause of axiomatic development was taken up in earnest by the [[Bourbaki group]] of mathematicians. Taken to its extreme, this attitude was thought to demand mathematics developed in its greatest generality. One started from the most general axioms, and then specialized, for example, by introducing [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over [[commutative ring]]s, and limiting to [[vector space]]s over the [[real number]]s only when absolutely necessary. The story proceeded in this fashion, even when the specializations were the theorems of primary interest.

In particular, this perspective placed little value on fields of mathematics (such as [[combinatorics]]) whose objects of study are very often special, or found in situations which can only superficially be related to more axiomatic branches of the subject.

==Category theory as a rival==

[[Category theory]] is a unifying theory of mathematics that was initially developed in the second half of the 20th century. In this respect it is an alternative and complement to set theory. A key theme from the "categorical" point of view is that mathematics requires not only certain kinds of objects ([[Lie group]]s, [[Banach space]]s, etc.) but also mappings between them that preserve their structure.

In particular, this clarifies exactly what it means for mathematical objects to be considered to be ''the same''. (For example, are all equilateral triangles ''the same'', or does size matter?) [[Saunders Mac Lane]] proposed that any concept with enough 'ubiquity' (occurring in various branches of mathematics) deserved isolating and studying in its own right. Category theory is arguably better adapted to that end than any other current approach. The disadvantages of relying on so-called ''[[abstract nonsense]]'' are a certain blandness and abstraction in the sense of breaking away from the roots in concrete problems. Nevertheless, the methods of category theory have steadily advanced in acceptance, in numerous areas (from [[D-module]]s to [[categorical logic]]).

==Uniting theories==

On a less grandiose scale, there are frequent instances in which it appears that sets of results in two different branches of mathematics are similar, and one might ask whether there is a unifying framework which clarifies the connections. We have already noted the example of analytic geometry, and more generally the field of [[algebraic geometry]] thoroughly develops the connections between geometric objects ([[algebraic varieties]], or more generally [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s) and algebraic ones ([[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s); the touchstone result here is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] which roughly speaking shows that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the two types of objects.

One may view other theorems in the same light. For example, the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]] asserts that there is a one-to-one correspondence between extensions of a field and subgroups of the field's [[Galois group]]. The [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]] for elliptic curves (now proven) establishes a one-to-one correspondence between curves defined as [[modular forms]] and [[elliptic curve]]s defined over the [[rational number]]s. A research area sometimes nicknamed [[Monstrous Moonshine]] developed connections between modular forms and the finite simple group known as the [[Monster group|Monster]], starting solely with the surprise observation that in each of them  the rather unusual number 196884 would arise very naturally. Another field, known as the [[Langlands program]], likewise starts with apparently haphazard similarities (in this case, between number-theoretical results and representations of certain groups) and looks for constructions from which both sets of results would be corollaries.

==Recent developments in relation with modular theory==

A well-known example is the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]], now the [[modularity theorem]], which proposed that each [[elliptic curve]] over the rational numbers can be translated into a [[modular form]] (in such a way as to preserve the associated [[L-function]]). There are difficulties in identifying this with an isomorphism, in any strict sense of the word. Certain curves had been known to be both elliptic curves (of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1) and [[modular curve]]s, before the conjecture was formulated (about 1955). The surprising part of the conjecture was the extension to factors of [[Jacobian variety|Jacobian]]s of modular curves of genus &gt; 1. It had probably not seemed plausible that there would be 'enough' such rational factors, before the conjecture was enunciated; and in fact the numerical evidence was slight until around 1970, when tables began to confirm it. The case of elliptic curves with [[complex multiplication]] was proved by Shimura in 1964. This conjecture stood for decades before being proved in generality.

In fact the [[Langlands program]] (or philosophy) is much more like a web of unifying conjectures; it really does postulate that the general theory of [[automorphic form]]s is regulated by the [[Langlands dual group|L-group]]s introduced by [[Robert Langlands]]. His ''principle of functoriality'' with respect to the L-group has a very large explanatory value with respect to known types of ''lifting'' of automorphic forms (now more broadly studied as [[automorphic representation]]s). While this theory is in one sense closely linked with the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, it should be understood that the conjecture actually operates in the opposite direction. It requires the existence of an automorphic form, starting with an object that (very abstractly) lies in a category of [[motive (mathematics)|motives]].

Another significant related point is that the Langlands approach stands apart from the whole development triggered by [[monstrous moonshine]] (connections between [[elliptic modular function]]s as [[Fourier series]], and the [[group representation]]s of the [[Monster group]] and other [[sporadic group]]s). The Langlands philosophy neither foreshadowed nor was able to include this line of research.

==Isomorphism conjectures in K-theory==

Another case, which so far is less well-developed but covers a wide range of mathematics, is the conjectural basis of some parts of [[K-theory]]. The [[Baum–Connes conjecture]], now a long-standing problem, has been joined by others in a group known as the [[isomorphism conjectures in K-theory]]. These include the [[Farrell–Jones conjecture]] and [[Bost conjecture]].

'''Veṇvāroha''' is a work in [[Sanskrit]] composed by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama|Mādhava (c.1350 – c.1425) of Sangamagrāma]]  the founder of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]]. It is a work in 74 verses describing methods for the computation of the true positions of the [[Moon]] at intervals of about half an hour for various days in an [[Moon cycle|anomalistic cycle]]. This work is an elaboration of an earlier and shorter work of Mādhava himself titled ''[[Sphuta-chandrapti|Sphutacandrāpti]]''.&lt;ref name="Pingree"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Edwin Pingree|title=Census of the exact sciences in Sanskrit|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|location=Philadelphia|date=1981|volume=4|pages=414 |isbn=0-87169-146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Veṇvāroha'' is the most popular astronomical work of Mādhava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Helaine Selin|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Westen Cultures |publisher=Springer|date=1997|pages=522|chapter=Article by R.C. Gupta|isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dated 1403 [[Common Era|CE]]. [[Achyuta Pisharati|Acyuta Piṣārati]] (1550–1621), another prominent [[mathematician]]/[[astronomer]] of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala school]], has composed a [[Malayalam]] [[Close reading|commentary]] on ''Veṇvāroha''.&lt;ref name="Pingree"/&gt; This astronomical treatise is of a type generally described as Karaṇa texts in [[India]]. Such works are characterized by the fact that they are compilations of [[algorithm|computational methods]] of [[astronomy|practical astronomy]]. The title ''Veṇvāroha'' literally means [[Bamboo]] Climbing and it is indicative of the computational procedure expounded in the text. The computational scheme is like climbing a bamboo tree, going up and up step by step at measured equal heights.

The novelty and ingenuity of the method attracted the attention of several of the followers of Mādhava and they composed similar texts thereby creating a genre of works in Indian mathematical tradition  collectively referred to as ‘veṇvāroha texts’. These include ''Drik-veṇvārohakriya'' of unknown authorship of epoch 1695 and ''Veṇvārohastaka'' of [[Puthumana Somayaji|Putuman Somāyaji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b5e_1.pdf|author=K.V. Sarma|title=A survey of source materials |publisher=Indian national Academy of Science|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the technical terminology of astronomy, the ingenuity introduced by Mādhava in ''Veṇvāroha'' can be explained thus: Mādhava has endeavored   to compute the true [[longitude]] of the Moon by making use of the true motions rather than the epicyclic astronomy of the [[Aryabhata]] tradition. He made  use of the anomalistic revolutions for computing the true positions of the [[Moon]] using the successive true daily velocity specified in ''[[Candravakyas|Candravākyas]]'' (Table of Moon-mnemonics) for easy memorization and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12625">In [[mathematics]], '''point-free geometry''' is a [[geometry]] whose primitive [[ontology|ontological]] notion is ''region'' rather than [[point (geometry)|point]]. Two [[axiomatic system]]s are set out below, one grounded in [[mereology]], the other in [[mereotopology]] and known as ''connection theory''. A point can mark a space or objects.

==Motivation==
Point-free geometry was first formulated in [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] (1919, 1920), not as a theory of [[geometry]] or of [[spacetime]], but of "events" and of an "extension relation" between events. Whitehead's purposes were as much philosophical as scientific and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;See Kneebone (1963), chpt. 13.5, for a gentle introduction to Whitehead's theory. Also see Lucas (2000), chpt. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead did not set out his theories in a manner that would satisfy present-day canons of formality. The two formal [[first order theory|first order theories]] described in this entry were devised by others in order to clarify and refine Whitehead's theories. The [[domain of discourse|domain]] for both theories consists of "regions." All unquantified variables in this entry should be taken as tacitly [[Quantification (logic)|universally quantified]]; hence all axioms should be taken as universal closures. No axiom requires more than three quantified variables; hence a translation of first order theories into [[relation algebra]] is possible. Each set of axioms has but four [[existential quantifier]]s.

==Inclusion-based point-free geometry ([[mereology]])==
The axioms '''G1-G7''' are, but for numbering, those of Def. 2.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008) (see also Gerla (1995)). The identifiers of the form '''WPn''', included in the verbal description of each axiom, refer to the corresponding axiom in Simons (1987: 83).

The fundamental primitive [[binary relation]] is ''Inclusion'', denoted by [[infix]] "&amp;le;". (''Inclusion'' corresponds to the binary ''Parthood'' relation that is a standard feature of all mereological theories.) The intuitive meaning of ''x''&amp;le;''y'' is "''x'' is part of ''y''." Assuming that [[identity function|identity]], denoted by infix "=", is part of the background logic, the [[binary relation]] ''Proper Part'', denoted by infix "&lt;", is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; x&lt;y \leftrightarrow (x\le y \and x \not = y).&lt;/math&gt;

The axioms are:
*Inclusion [[partial order|partially orders]] the [[domain of discourse|domain]].
:'''G1.'''  &lt;math&gt;x\le x.&lt;/math&gt;      ([[reflexive relation|reflexive]])
:'''G2.''' &lt;math&gt;(x\le z \and z\le y) \rightarrow x\le y.&lt;/math&gt;   ([[transitive relation|transitive]]) '''WP4'''.
:'''G3.''' &lt;math&gt;(x\le y \and  y\le x) \rightarrow x = y.&lt;/math&gt;   ([[antisymmetric relation|anti-symmetric]])

*Given any two regions, there exists a region that includes both of them. '''WP6'''.
:'''G4.''' &lt;math&gt;\exists z[x\le z\and y\le z].&lt;/math&gt;

*Proper Part [[dense order|densely orders]] the [[domain of discourse|domain]]. '''WP5'''.
:'''G5.''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y\rightarrow\exists z [x&lt;z&lt;y].&lt;/math&gt;

*Both [[atomic (order theory)|atomic regions]] and a [[mereology|universal region]] do not exist. Hence the [[domain of discourse|domain]] has neither an upper nor a lower bound. '''WP2'''.
:'''G6.''' &lt;math&gt;\exists yz[y&lt;x \and x&lt;z].&lt;/math&gt;

* Proper Parts Principle. If all the proper parts of ''x'' are proper parts of ''y'', then ''x'' is included in ''y''. '''WP3'''. 
:'''G7.''' &lt;math&gt;\forall z[z&lt;x \rightarrow z&lt;y] \rightarrow x\le y.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[model theory|model]] of '''G1–G7''' is an ''inclusion space''.

'''Definition''' (Gerla and Miranda 2008: Def. 4.1). Given some inclusion space, an '''abstractive class''' is a class ''G'' of regions such that ''G'' is [[total order|totally ordered]] by Inclusion. Moreover, there does not exist a region included in all of the regions included in ''G''.

Intuitively, an abstractive class defines a geometrical entity whose dimensionality is less than that of the inclusion space. For example, if the inclusion space is the [[Euclidean plane]], then the corresponding abstractive classes are [[point (geometry)|point]]s and [[line (geometry)|line]]s.

Inclusion-based point-free geometry (henceforth "point-free geometry") is essentially an axiomatization of Simons's (1987: 83) system '''W.''' In turn, '''W''' formalizes a theory in Whitehead (1919) whose axioms are not made explicit. Point-free geometry is '''W''' with this defect repaired. Simons (1987) did not repair this defect, instead proposing in a footnote that the reader do so as an exercise. The primitive relation of '''W''' is Proper Part, a [[strict partial order]]. The theory&lt;ref&gt;Kneebone (1963), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; of Whitehead (1919) has a single primitive binary relation ''K'' defined as ''xKy'' &amp;harr; ''y''&lt;''x''. Hence ''K'' is the [[converse relation|converse]] of Proper Part. Simons's '''WP1''' asserts that Proper Part is [[irreflexive]] and so corresponds to '''G1'''. '''G3''' establishes that inclusion, unlike Proper Part, is [[Antisymmetric relation|anti-symmetric]].

Point-free geometry is closely related to a [[List of first-order theories|dense linear order]] '''D''', whose axioms are '''G1-3''', '''G5''', and the totality axiom &lt;math&gt; x \le y \or y \le x.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Stoll, R. R., 1963. ''Set Theory and Logic''. Dover reprint, 1979. P. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence inclusion-based point-free geometry would be a proper extension of '''D''' (namely '''D'''&amp;cup;{'''G4''', '''G6''', '''G7'''}), were it not that the '''D''' relation "&amp;le;" is a [[total order]].

==Connection theory==
In his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'', [[A. N. Whitehead]] proposed a different approach, one inspired by De Laguna (1922). Whitehead took as primitive the [[topological]] notion of "contact" between two regions, resulting in a primitive "connection relation" between events. Connection theory '''C''' is a [[first order theory]] that distills the first 12 of the 31 assumptions in chpt. 2 of ''[[Process and Reality]]'' into 6 axioms, '''C1-C6'''. '''C''' is a proper fragment of the theories proposed in Clarke (1981), who noted their [[mereology|mereological]] character. Theories that, like '''C''', feature both inclusion and [[topology|topological]] primitives, are called [[mereotopology|mereotopologies]].

'''C''' has one primitive [[relation (mathematics)|relation]], binary "connection," denoted by the [[prefix]]ed [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate letter]] ''C''. That ''x'' is included in ''y'' can now be defined as ''x''&amp;le;''y'' &amp;harr; &amp;forall;z[''Czx''&amp;rarr;''Czy'']. Unlike the case with inclusion spaces, connection theory enables defining "non-tangential" inclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Presumably this is Casati and Varzi's (1999) "Internal Part" predicate, IP''xy'' &amp;harr; (x&amp;le;y)&amp;and;(C''zx''&amp;rarr;&amp;exist;''v''[''v''&amp;le;''z'' &amp;and; ''v''&amp;le;''y'']. This definition combines their (4.8) and (3.1).&lt;/ref&gt; a total order that enables the construction of abstractive classes. Gerla and Miranda (2008) argue that only thus can mereotopology unambiguously define a [[Point (geometry)|point]].

The axioms '''C1-C6''' below are, but for numbering, those of Def. 3.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008).

*''C'' is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. '''C.1.'''
:'''C1. '''&lt;math&gt; \ Cxx.&lt;/math&gt;

*''C'' is [[symmetric]]. '''C.2.'''
:'''C2.'''  &lt;math&gt;Cxy\rightarrow Cyx.&lt;/math&gt;

*''C'' is [[extensionality|extensional]]. '''C.11.'''
:'''C3.'''   &lt;math&gt;\forall z[Czx \leftrightarrow Czy] \rightarrow x = y.&lt;/math&gt;

* All regions have proper parts, so that '''C''' is an [[atomic (order theory)|atomless]] theory. '''P.9.'''
:'''C4.'''    &lt;math&gt;\exists y[y&lt;x].&lt;/math&gt;

*Given any two regions, there is a region connected to both of them.
:'''C5.'''   &lt;math&gt;\exists z[Czx\and Czy].&lt;/math&gt;

*All regions have at least two unconnected parts. '''C.14.'''
:'''C6.'''   &lt;math&gt;\exists yz[(y\le x)\and (z\le x)\and\neg Cyz].&lt;/math&gt;

A model of '''C''' is a ''connection space''.

Following the verbal description of each axiom is the identifier of the corresponding axiom in Casati and Varzi (1999). Their system '''SMT''' (''strong mereotopology'') consists of '''C1-C3''', and is essentially due to Clarke (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorczyk (1960) proposed a similar theory, whose motivation was primarily [[topology|topological]].&lt;/ref&gt; Any [[mereotopology]] can be made [[atomic (order theory)|atomless]] by invoking '''C4''', without risking paradox or triviality. Hence '''C''' extends the atomless variant of '''SMT''' by means of the axioms '''C5''' and '''C6''', suggested by chpt. 2 of ''[[Process and Reality]]''. For an advanced and detailed discussion of systems related to '''C''', see Roeper (1997).

Biacino and Gerla (1991) showed that every [[model theory|model]] of Clarke's theory is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and models of such algebras cannot distinguish connection from overlap. It is doubtful whether either fact is faithful to Whitehead's intent.

In [[computational science]], '''wildfire modeling''' is concerned with [[numerical weather prediction|numerical simulation]] of [[wildland fire]]s in order to understand and predict fire behavior. Wildfire modeling can ultimately aid [[wildland fire suppression]], namely increase safety of [[firefighter]]s and the public, reduce risk, and minimize damage. Wildfire modeling can also aid in protecting [[ecosystem]]s, [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s, and [[air quality]].

==Objectives of wildfire modeling==

Wildfire modeling attempts to reproduce fire behavior, such as how quickly the fire spreads, in which direction, how much heat it generates. A key input to behavior modeling is the [[Fuel model|Fuel Model]], or type of fuel, through which the fire is burning.  Behavior modeling can also include whether the fire transitions from the surface (a "surface fire") to the tree crowns (a "crown fire"), as well as extreme fire behavior including rapid rates of spread, [[fire whirl]]s, and tall well-developed convection columns. Fire modeling also attempts to estimate fire effects, such as the [[ecology|ecological]] and [[hydrology|hydrological]] effects of the fire, fuel consumption, tree mortality, and amount and rate of smoke produced.

==Environmental factors==

Wildland fire behavior is affected by [[weather]], [[fuel]] characteristics, and [[topography]].

Weather influences fire through [[wind]] and [[moisture]].  [[Wind]] increases the fire spread in the wind direction, higher [[temperature]] makes the fire burn faster, while higher [[relative humidity]], and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (rain or snow) may slow it down or extinguish it altogether. Weather involving fast wind changes can be particularly dangerous, since they can suddenly change the fire direction and behavior. Such weather includes [[cold front]]s, [[foehn wind]]s, [[thunderstorm]] [[downdrafts]], [[sea breeze|sea and land breeze]], and [[Daytime (astronomy)|diurnal]] [[slope wind]]s.

Wildfire fuel includes grass, wood, and anything else that can burn. Small dry twigs burn faster while large logs burn slower; dry fuel ignites more easily and burns faster than wet fuel.

Topography factors that influence wildfires include the orientation toward the sun, which influences the amount of energy received from the sun, and the slope (fire spreads faster uphill). Fire can accelerate in narrow canyons and it can be slowed down or stopped by barriers such as creeks and roads.

These factors act in combination. Rain or snow increases the fuel moisture, high [[relative humidity]] slows the drying of the fuel, while winds can make fuel dry faster. Wind can change the fire-accelerating effect of slopes to effects such as downslope windstorms (called [[Santa Ana winds|Santa Ana]]s, foehn winds, East winds, depending on the geographic location). Fuel properties may vary with topography as plant density varies with elevation or aspect with respect to the sun.

It has long been recognized that "fires create their own weather." That is, the heat and moisture created by the fire feed back into the atmosphere, creating intense winds that drive the fire behavior. The heat produced by the wildfire changes the temperature of the atmosphere and creates strong updrafts, which can change the direction of surface winds. The water vapor released by the fire changes the moisture balance of the atmosphere. The water vapor can be carried away, where the [[latent heat]] stored in the vapor is released through [[condensation]].

==Approaches to fire modeling==

Like all models in computational science, fire models need to strike a balance between fidelity, availability of data, and fast execution. Wildland fire models span a vast range of complexity, from simple cause and effect principles to the most physically complex presenting a difficult supercomputing challenge that cannot hope to be solved faster than real time.

[[Forest-fire model]]s have been developed since 1940 to the present, but a lot of chemical and thermodynamic questions related to fire behaviour are still to be resolved. Scientists and their forest fire models from 1940 till 2003 are listed in article.&lt;ref&gt;E. Pastor, L. Zarate, E. Planas and J. Arnaldos. Mathematical models and calculation systems for the study of wildland fire behaviour. Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 29:139–153, 2003.  Doi:10.1016/S0360-1285(03)00017-0)&lt;/ref&gt; Models can be divided into three groups: Empirical, Semi-empirical, and Physically based.

===Empirical models===

Conceptual models from experience and intuition from past fires can be used to anticipate the future. Many semi-empirical fire spread equations, as in those published by the USDA Forest Service,&lt;ref name="Rothermel-1972-MMP"&gt;Richard C. Rothermel. A mathematical model for predicting fire spread in wildland fires. USDA Forest Service Research Paper INT-115, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Forestry Canada,&lt;ref name="Forestry-1992-DSC"&gt;Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group. Development and structure of the Canadian forest fire behavior prediction system. Forestry Canada, Science and Sustainable Development Directorate, Ottawa, ON, Information Report ST-X-3, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel, Bary, and Gill,&lt;ref name="Noble-1980-FMD"&gt;I. R. Noble, G. A. V. Bary, and A. M. Gill. McArthur's fire danger meters expressed as equations. ''Australian Journal of Ecology'', 5:201--203, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cheney, Gould, and Catchpole&lt;ref name="Cheney-1993-IFW"&gt;N. P. Cheney, J. S. Gould, and W. R. Catchpole. The influence of fuel, weather, and fire shape variables on fire-spread in grasslands. ''International Journal of Wildland Fire'', 3:31--44, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; for Australasian fuel complexes have been developed for quick estimation of fundamental parameters of interest such as fire spread rate, flame length, and fireline intensity of surface fires at a point for specific fuel complexes, assuming a representative point-location wind and terrain slope. Based on the work by Fons's in 1946,&lt;ref name="Fons-1946-AFS"&gt;W. L. Fons. Analysis of fire spread in light fuels. ''Journal of Agricultural Research'', 72:93--121, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; and Emmons in 1963,&lt;ref name="Emmons-1963-FF"&gt;H. W. Emmons. Fire in the forest. ''Fire Research Abstracts and Reviews'', 5:163, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; the quasi-steady equilibrium spread rate calculated for a surface fire on flat ground in no-wind conditions was calibrated using data of piles of sticks burned in a flame chamber/wind tunnel to represent other wind and slope conditions for the fuel complexes tested.

Two-dimensional fire growth models such as [[FARSITE]]&lt;ref name="Finney-1998-FFA"&gt;Mark A. Finney. FARSITE: Fire area simulator-model development and evaluation. Res. Pap. RMRS-RP-4, Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station. 47 p., http://www.farsite.org, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and Prometheus,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://firegrowthmodel.ca/  | title = PROMETHEUS | publisher =  Tymstra, C.; Bryce, R.W.; Wotton, B.M.; Armitage, O.B. 2009. Development and structure of Prometheus: the Canadian wildland fire growth simulation Model.  Inf. Rep. NOR-X-417. Nat. Resour. Can., Can. For. Serv., North. For. Cent., Edmonton, AB. | accessdate = 2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canadian wildland fire growth model designed to work in Canadian fuel complexes, have been developed that apply such semi-empirical relationships and others regarding ground-to-crown transitions to calculate fire spread and other parameters along the surface. Certain assumptions must be made in models such as FARSITE and Prometheus to shape the fire growth. For example, Prometheus and FARSITE use the Huygens principle of wave propagation. A set of equations that can be used to propagate (shape and direction) a fire front using an elliptical shape was developed by Richards in 1990.&lt;ref name="Richards-1990-EGM"&gt;G.D. Richards, “An Elliptical Growth Model of Forest Fire Fronts and Its Numerical Solution”, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng.,. 30:1163-1179, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more sophisticated applications use a three-dimensional numerical weather prediction system to provide inputs such as wind velocity to one of the fire growth models listed above, the input was passive and the feedback of the fire upon the atmospheric wind and humidity are not accounted for.

===Physically based models and coupling with the atmosphere===

A simplified physically based two-dimensional fire spread models based upon conservation laws that use radiation as the dominant heat transfer mechanism and convection, which represents the effect of wind and slope, lead to [[reaction–diffusion system]]s of [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref name="Asensio-2002-WFM"&gt;M. I. Asensio and L. Ferragut. On a wildland fire model with radiation. ''Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engrg.'', 54:137--157, 2002 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nme.420 fultext]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandel-2008-WMD"&gt;Jan Mandel, Lynn S. Bennethum, Jonathan D. Beezley, Janice L. Coen, Craig C.

More complex physical models join [[computational fluid dynamics]] models with a wildland fire component and allow the fire to feed back upon the atmosphere. These models include [[NCAR]]'s Coupled Atmosphere-Wildland Fire-Environment (CAWFE) model developed in 2005,&lt;ref name="Coen-2005-SBE"&gt;J. L. Coen.

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF03043 fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; and are beginning to be applied to wildland urban interface house-to-house fire spread at the community-scale.

The cost of added physical complexity is a corresponding increase in computational cost, so much so that a full three-dimensional explicit treatment of [[combustion]] in wildland fuels by [[direct numerical simulation]] (DNS) at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling does not exist, is beyond current supercomputers, and does not currently make sense to do because of the limited skill of weather models at spatial resolution under 1&amp;nbsp;km. Consequently, even these more complex models parameterize the fire in some way, for example, papers by Clark&lt;ref name="Clark-1996-CAFb"&gt;T. L. Clark, M. A. Jenkins, J. Coen, and David Packham. A coupled atmospheric-fire model: Convective Froude number and dynamic fingering. ''International Journal of Wildland Fire'', 6:177--190, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark-1996-CAF"&gt;Terry L. Clark, Marry Ann Jenkins, Janice Coen, and David Packham. A coupled atmospheric-fire model: Convective feedback on fire line dynamics. ''J. Appl. Meteor'', 35:875--901, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; use equations developed by Rothermel for the USDA forest service&lt;ref name="Rothermel-1972-MMP"/&gt; to calculate local fire spread rates using fire-modified local winds. And, although FIRETEC and WFDS carry prognostic conservation equations for the reacting fuel and oxygen concentrations, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the reaction rate-limiting mixing of fuel and oxygen, so approximations must be made concerning the subgrid-scale temperature distribution or the combustion reaction rates themselves. These models also are too small-scale to interact with a weather model, so the fluid motions use a computational fluid dynamics model confined in a box much smaller than the typical wildfire.

Attempts to create the most complete theoretical model were made by Albini F.A. in USA and Grishin A.M.&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Grishin. Mathematical models of forest fires and New Methods of Fighting Them. Publishing House of the Tomsk University, Tomsk, Russia, 1997. (edited by F.A. Albini)&lt;/ref&gt; in Russia. Grishin's work is based on the fundamental laws of physics, conservation and theoretical justifications are provided. The simplified two-dimensional model of running crown forest fire was developed in [[Belarusian State University]] by Barovik D.V.&lt;ref&gt;Barovik, D.; Taranchuk, V. 2010. Mathematical modelling of running crown forest fires. Mathematical Modelling and Analysis 15(2):161-174 [http://elib.bsu.by/bitstream/123456789/10110/1/TVB_2010.pdf fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; and Taranchuk V.B..

==Data assimilation==

[[Data assimilation]] periodically adjusts the model state to incorporate new data using statistical methods. Because fire is highly nonlinear and irreversible, data assimilation for fire models poses special challenges, and standard methods, such as the [[ensemble Kalman filter]] (EnKF) do not work well. Statistical variability of corrections and especially large corrections may result in nonphysical states, which tend to be preceded or accompanied by large spatial [[gradient]]s. In order to ease this problem, the [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularized]] EnKF&lt;ref name="Johns-2008-TEK"&gt;Craig J. Johns and Jan Mandel. A two-stage ensemble Kalman filter for smooth data assimilation. ''Environmental and Ecological Statistics'', 15:101--110, 2008. Proceedings of Conference on New Developments of Statistical Analysis in Wildlife, Fisheries, and Ecological Research, Oct 13-16, 2004, Columbia, MI. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-007-0033-0 fulltext] [http://math.ucdenver.edu/~jmandel/papers/cjjm-fires-revised.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; penalizes large changes of spatial gradients in the Bayesian update in EnKF. The regularization technique has a stabilizing effect on the simulations in the ensemble but it does not improve much the ability of the EnKF to track the data: The posterior ensemble is made out of [[linear combination]]s of the prior ensemble, and if a reasonably close location and shape of the fire cannot be found between the linear combinations, the data assimilation is simply out of luck, and the ensemble cannot approach the data. From that point on, the ensemble evolves essentially without regard to the data. This is called filter divergence. So, there is clearly a need to adjust the simulation state by a position change rather than an additive correction only. The ''morphing EnKF''&lt;ref name="Beezley-2008-MEK"&gt;Jonathan D. Beezley and Jan Mandel. Morphing ensemble Kalman filters. ''Tellus'', 60A:131--140, 2008 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0870.2007.00275.x fulltext] [https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3693 preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; combines the ideas of data assimilation with [[image registration]] and [[morphing]] to provide both additive and position correction in a natural manner, and can be used to change a model state reliably in response to data.&lt;ref name="Mandel-2007-DAW"/&gt;

==Limitations and practical use==

The limitations on fire modeling are not entirely computational. At this level, the models encounter limits in knowledge about the composition of [[pyrolysis]] products and [[reaction pathway]]s, in addition to gaps in basic understanding about some aspects of fire behavior such as fire spread in live fuels and surface-to-crown fire transition.

Thus, while more complex models have value in studying fire behavior and testing fire spread in a range of scenarios, from the application point of view, FARSITE and [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]]-based applications of BEHAVE have shown great utility as practical in-the-field tools because of their ability to provide estimates of fire behavior in real time. While the coupled fire-atmosphere models have the ability to incorporate the ability of the fire to affect its own local weather, and model many aspects of the explosive, unsteady nature of fires that cannot be incorporated in current tools, it remains a challenge to apply these more complex models in a faster-than-real-time operational environment. Also, although they have reached a certain degree of realism when simulating specific natural fires, they must yet address issues such as identifying what specific, relevant operational information they could provide beyond current tools, how the simulation time could fit the operational time frame for decisions (therefore, the simulation must run substantially faster than real time), what temporal and spatial resolution must be used by the model, and how they estimate the inherent uncertainty in numerical weather prediction in their forecast. These operational constraints must be used to steer model development.
