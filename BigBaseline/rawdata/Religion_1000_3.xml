{{Locke}}
'''''A Letter Concerning Toleration''''' by [[John Locke]] was originally published in 1689. Its initial publication was in [[Latin]], though it was immediately translated into other languages. Locke's work appeared amidst a fear that [[Catholicism]] might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing [[religious toleration]] as the answer. This "letter" is addressed to an anonymous "Honored Sir": this was actually Locke's close friend [[Philipp van Limborch]], who published it without Locke's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;A Letter Concerning Toleration by Locke, John; Tully, James H.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In the wake of discovery of the [[Rye House Plot]] and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s persecution of the Whigs, Locke fled England to Amsterdam, Holland in September 1683.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Klibansky, 'Preface', in Klibansky and J. W. Gough (eds.), ''Espitola de Tolerantia/A Letter on Toleration'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Cranston, ''John Locke: A Biography'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), pp. 227-230.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, Locke had taken an interest in the debate about religious toleration. The question was much debated in Holland during Locke's stay and in October 1685 [[Louis XIV of France]] [[Edict of Fontainebleau|Revoked]] the [[Edict of Nantes]] that had guaranteed religious toleration for French Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky, p. x, pp.
xvi-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Holland, Locke met [[Philipp van Limborch]], a Professor of Divinity, and it was to be a discussion with Limborch that persuaded Locke to temporarily put aside his work on ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and put forth his ideas on toleration. Locke wrote the ''Letter'' during the winter of 1685-86.&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky, pp. viii-ix, p. x, pp. xvi-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument of the ''Letter''==
One of the founders of [[Empiricism]], Locke develops a [[philosophy]] that is contrary to the one expressed by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', in supporting toleration for various [[Christian]] denominations. Hobbes did allow for individuals to maintain their own religious beliefs as long as they outwardly expressed those of the state, however, and it has been argued that Locke's rejection of Catholic Imperialism was the ultimate basis for his rejection of government's interest in spiritual salvation.&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Graf, 2007: ''Cervantes and Modernity: Four Essays on Modernity'', Bucknell University Press, pp. 141-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Hobbes, who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argues that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. Locke argues that civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate's attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. Locke's primary goal is to "distinguish exactly the business of civil government from that of religion." He seeks to persuade the reader that government is instituted to promote external interests, relating to life, liberty, and the general welfare, while the church exists to promote internal interests, i.e., salvation. The two serve separate functions, and so, must be considered to be separate institutions.

For Locke, the only way a Church can gain genuine converts is through persuasion and not through violence. This relates to his central conclusion, namely, that the government should not involve itself in care of souls. In support of this argument he presents three main reasons: (1) individuals, according to Locke, cannot divest control over their souls to secular forces, as God does not appoint the magistrate; (2) force cannot create the change necessary for salvation, because while it can coerce obedience, it cannot change one's beliefs; and (3) even if coercion could persuade someone of a notion, it would not help with ensuring salvation, because there is no reason to believe that magistrates are reliable judges of religious truth.

Locke argued that those who believed that "faith need not be kept with heretics" and that "kings excommunicated forfeit their kingdoms"
had "no right to be tolerated by the magistrate". Neither did "those who refuse to teach that dissenters from their own religion should be tolerated". This was because those who believed such doctrines would, given the opportunity,
attack the laws and the liberty and property of the citizen. These people, Locke argued, sought religious toleration "only until they have supplies and forces enough to make the attempt" on liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough, pp. 131-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrines that "faith need not be kept with heretics" and that "kings excommunicated forfeit their kingdoms" were commonly held to be Catholic beliefs by Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;John Marshall, ''John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 690-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough,
pp. 160-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Goldie (ed.), ''A Letter Concerning Toleration and Other Writings'' (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2010), p. 50, notes 127 and 128.&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to France in 1676, Locke recorded that the belief that "faith does not have to be kept with heretics" was an important factor in the intolerance shown to the Protestant [[Huguenots]].&lt;ref&gt;John Lough (ed.), ''Locke's Travels in France, 1675-9: As related in his Journals, Correspondence and other papers'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1953), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

"That church can have no right to be tolerated by the magistrate," Locke argued, "which is so constituted that all who enter it ''ipso facto'' pass into the allegiance and service of another prince".&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough,
p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; If this were to be tolerated, "the magistrate would make room for a foreign jurisdiction in his own territory and...allow for his own people to be enlisted as soldiers against his own government".&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough,
p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted by historians as a reference to the Catholic Church, with the Pope being the prince to whom Catholics owed allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;Cranston, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky,
p. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Gough, 'Introduction',
in Klibansky and Gough, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Gough, ''John Locke's Political Philosophy: Eight Studies'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), p.
197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Sowerby, ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2013), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recently scholars have challenged the idea that Locke opposed the toleration of Catholics in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 690-694.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Goldie, 'Introduction', in Goldie (ed.), ''A Letter Concerning Toleration and Other Writings'', p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sowerby, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Goldie]] argues that the traditional interpretation of Locke's position on Catholics "needs finessing, since he did not, in fact, exclude the theoretical possibility of tolerating Catholics...if Catholics could discard their uncivil beliefs, they could then be tolerated".&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldie asserts that Locke was opposed not to Catholicism as such but [[antinomianism]], the belief that ordinary moral laws are superseded by religious truth.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Sowerby]] also claims that Locke left open the possibility that Catholics could be tolerated if they adopted tolerant principles and rejected political allegiance to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Sowerby,
p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Marshall (historian)|John Marshall]] has argued that a number of passages in the ''Letter'' demonstrate that Locke believed that Catholics "in their terms of worship and religious speculative beliefs...deserved their worship to be free".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall also notes that "The combination of Locke’s comments in the Letter suggest that during [its] composition ... Locke was once again struggling over how to discriminate between the series of associated political principles which for him made Catholics intolerable, and the religious worship and other religious beliefs of Catholics which deserved toleration."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 692.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke argued that [[atheists]] should not be tolerated because "Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon or sanctity for an atheist".&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is, however,  a passage added in a later edition of the ''[[Essay concerning Human Understanding]]'', where Locke perhaps questioned "whether 'atheism' was necessarily inimical to political obedience."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toleration]] is central to Locke's political philosophy. Consequently, only churches that teach toleration are to be allowed in his society. Locke’s view on the difficulty of knowing the [[one true religion]] may suggest that religion is not personally important to Locke, but it also may point to the deep uncertainties surrounding religious belief in a time of political and intellectual conflict. In contrast, Locke’s view on atheism suggests that he was far from considering religion as unimportant. As an empiricist, he took practical considerations into account, such as how the peace of civil society will be affected by religious toleration. A close reading of the text also reveals that Locke relies on [[Bible|Biblical]] analysis at several key points in his argument.

==Reception==
There were immediate responses from the [[High Church]] Anglican clergy, published by [[Thomas Long (writer)|Thomas Long]] and [[Jonas Proast]]. Long believed the letter was written by an atheistically disguised Jesuit plot for the Roman Catholic Church to gain dominance by bringing chaos and ruin to church and state. Proast attacked the Letter and defended the view that the government has the right to use force to cause dissenters to reflect on the merits of Anglicanism, the True Religion.  Locke's reply to Proast developed into an extended, controversial exchange.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55383">{{short description|General review of religious attitudes towards scientific descriptions of evolution, and where relevant, their counterclaims}}
Although biological [[evolution]] has been vocally opposed by some religious groups, many other groups accept the scientific position, sometimes with additions to allow for theological considerations.  The positions of such groups are described by terms including "[[theistic evolution]]", "theistic evolutionism" or "evolutionary creation".  Theistic evolutionists believe that [[existence of God|there is a God]], that God is [[Creator deity|the creator]] of the [[matter|material]] universe and (by consequence) all life within, and that biological evolution is a [[nature|natural process]] within that creation. Evolution, according to this view, is simply a tool that God employed to develop [[human being|human life]]. According to the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], a [[Christian]] organization of scientists:

{{quotation|A theory of theistic evolution (TE) — also called evolutionary creation — proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve. Usually the "evolution" in "theistic evolution" means Total Evolution — astronomical evolution (to form galaxies, solar systems,...) and geological evolution (to form the earth's geology) plus chemical evolution (to form the first life) and biological evolution (for the development of life) — but it can refer only to biological evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Rusbult, Ph.D.|title=Evolutionary Creation|url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/te2-cr.htm|year=1998|publisher=American Scientific Affiliation|quote=A theory of theistic evolution (TE) — also called evolutionary creation * — proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve.  Usually the "evolution" in "theistic evolution" means Total Evolution — astronomical evolution (to form galaxies, solar systems,...) and geological evolution (to form the earth's geology) plus chemical evolution (to form the first life) and biological evolution (for the development of life) — but it can refer only to biological evolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Eugenie Scott]], Director of the US [[National Center for Science Education]], "In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline Protestant [[seminaries]], and it is the official position of the Catholic church".&lt;ref name="Scott, 271"&gt;* [[Eugenie C. Scott|Scott, Eugenie C.]], "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2952523 Antievolution and Creationism in the United States]", ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', Vol. 26, (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;263–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic evolution is not a [[scientific theory]], but a particular view about how the science of evolution relates to religious belief and interpretation. Theistic evolution supporters can be seen as one of the groups who reject the [[conflict thesis]] regarding the [[relationship between religion and science]]{{spaced ndash}}that is, they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict. Proponents of this view are sometimes described as Christian [[Darwinism|Darwinists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Acceptance ==
This view is generally accepted by major [[Christian]] churches, including the [[Catholic Church]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Episcopal Church USA]], and some other [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] denominations;&lt;ref name="Scott, 271"/&gt; virtually all [[Judaism|Jewish]] denominations; and other religious groups that lack a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] stance concerning some holy [[scripture]]s. Various biblical literalists have accepted or noted openness to this stance, including theologian [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B.B. Warfield]] and evangelist [[Billy Graham]]. A 2007 poll showed that acceptance among American Buddhists, Hindus and Jews was higher than among any Christian groups (graph below). One recent survey, conducted by physicist [[Max Tegmark]], on "of how different US faith communities view origins science, particularly evolution and Big Bang cosmology." Although "[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] reports that 46% of Americans believe that God created humans in their present form less than 10,000 years ago", it found "only 11% belong to religions openly rejecting evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[Max Tegmark, Eugena Lee, and Meia Chita-Tegmark, "The MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins: the Belief Gap", Feb. 11, 2013,http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/survey/survey.pdf, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

With this approach toward evolution, scriptural creation stories are typically interpreted as being [[allegory|allegorical]] in nature.
Both Jews and Christians have considered the idea of the [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|creation history as an allegory]] (instead of a historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory. An example in Christianity would be the earlier writings by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), though he later rejected allegory in favor of  literal interpretation.  By this Augustine meant that in Genesis 1 the terms "light", "day", and "morning" hold a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, and that this spiritual morning is just as literal as physical morning.  Augustine recognizes that the creation of a spiritual morning is as much a historical event as the creation of physical light.&lt;ref name="PSCF3-88Young.html"&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html Davis A.

Theistic evolutionists argue that it is inappropriate to use [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as a scientific text, since it was written in a pre-scientific age and originally intended for religious instruction; as such, seemingly chronological aspects of the creation accounts should be thought of in terms of a [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|literary framework]].  Theistic evolutionists may believe that creation is not literally a week-long process but a process beginning in the time of Genesis and continuing through all of time, including today.  This view affirms that God created the world and was the primary causation of our being, while scientific changes such as evolution are part of "creatio continua" or continuing creation which is still occurring in the never ending process of creation.  This is one possible way of interpreting biblical scriptures, such as Genesis, that seem otherwise to be in opposition to scientific theories, such as evolution.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;''Can You Believe in God and Evolution'', Ted Peters and Matrinez Hewlett&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spectrum of viewpoints ==
Many religious organizations accept evolutionary theory, though their related theological interpretations vary. Additionally, individuals or movements within such organizations may not accept evolution, and stances on evolution may have adapted (or evolved) throughout history.  There is considerable variance in overall acceptance of evolution between different countries, with studies showing that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan (only [[Turkey]] had a lower rate in the 34 countries sampled),&lt;ref name=miller-et-al&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1126746|title=SCIENCE COMMUNICATION: Public Acceptance of Evolution|year=2006|last1=Miller|first1=J.D.|journal=Science|volume=313|issue=5788|pages=765–6|pmid=16902112|last2=Scott|first2=EC|last3=Okamoto|first3=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attitudes within religious groups may differ somewhat between counties.

=== Bahá'í ===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[`Abdul-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote about the origin of life. A fundamental part of `Abdul-Bahá's teachings on evolution is the belief that all life came from the [[Common descent|same origin]]: "the origin of all material life is one..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that from this sole origin, the complete diversity of life was generated: "Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|pp= 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that a slow, gradual process led to the development of complex entities:

:"[T]he growth and development of all beings is gradual; this is the universal divine organization and the natural system. The seed does not at once become a tree; the embryo does not at once become a man; the mineral does not suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1908|pp=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|Framework interpretation (Genesis)}}

Evolution contradicts a literalistic interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]; however, according to [[Catholicism]] and most contemporary [[Protestant]] denominations, [[biblical literalism]] in the creation account is not mandatory. Christians have considered allegorical interpretations of Genesis since long before the development of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution, or [[James Hutton|Hutton]]'s principle of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. A notable example is [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), who, on [[theology|theological]] grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain reading of Genesis would require.&lt;ref name="PSCF3-88Young.html"/&gt; Modern theologians such as [[Meredith G. Kline]] and [[Henri Blocher]] have advocated what has become known as the [[literary framework interpretation]] of the days of Genesis.

==== Contemporary Christian denominations ====
All of the traditional [[mainline Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s support or accept theistic evolution. For example, on 12 February 2006, the 197th anniversary of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth was commemorated by "[[Evolution Sunday]]" where the message that followers of Christ do not have to choose between biblical stories of creation and evolution was taught in classes and sermons at many [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Baptist]] and community churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060220creationism.shtml Churches urged to challenge Intelligent Design  -20/02/06]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[National Council of Churches]] United States has issued a teaching resource to "assist people of faith who experience no conflict between science and their faith and who embrace science as one way of appreciating the beauty and complexity of
God's creation." This resource cites the Episcopal Church, according to whom the stories of creation in Genesis "should not be understood as historical and scientific accounts of origins but as proclamations of basic theological truths about creation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncccusa.org/pdfs/evolutionbrochurefinal.html Science, Religion, and the Teaching of Evolution in Public School Science Classes] (pdf), The [[National Council of Churches]] Committee on Public Education and Literacy, [http://www.ncccusa.org/news/060330evolution.html Teaching Evolution], March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The positions of particular denominations are discussed below.

===== Anglicanism =====
[[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] (including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the [[Church of England]] and others) believe that the Bible "contains all things necessary to salvation," while believing that "science and Christian theology can complement one another in the quest for truth and understanding." Specifically on the subject of creation/evolution, some Anglicans view "Big Bang cosmology" as being "in tune with both the concepts of creation out of nothing and continuous creation." Their position is clearly set out in the ''Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://episcopalscience.org/creation-science/ Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] Dr [[Rowan Williams]] expressed his thought that "creationism is, in a sense, a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories. Whatever the biblical account of creation is, it's not a theory alongside theories... My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,1735404,00.html ''The Guardian'', March 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that creationism should not be taught in schools.

===== United Methodist Church =====
The [[United Methodist Church]] affirms a Creator God and supports the scientific study of evolution.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We recognize science as a legitimate interpretation of God's natural world. We affirm the validity of the claims of science in describing the natural world and in determining what is scientific. We preclude science from making authoritative claims about theological issues and theology from making authoritative claims about scientific issues. We find that science's descriptions of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution are not in conflict with theology." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=3082929&amp;ct=6715227] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607070533/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=3082929&amp;ct=6715227 |date=2011-06-07 }}  The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church – 2008,  The United Methodist Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== Church of the Nazarene =====
The [[Church of the Nazarene]], an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian denomination, sees "knowledge acquired by science and human inquiry equal to that acquired by divine revelation," and, while the church "'believes in the Biblical account of creation' and holds that God is the sole creator, it allows latitude 'regarding the "how" of creation.'"&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20657204/site/newsweek/ "Can God Love Darwin, Too?" by Sharon Begley, ''Newsweek'', Sept. 17, 2007 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Richard G. Colling]], author of ''Random Designer''&lt;ref&gt;''Random Designer: Created from Chaos to Connect with the Creator'', Browning Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-9753904-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and professor at [[Olivet Nazarene University]], received criticism from elements within the denomination in 2007 for his book (published in 2004),&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt; [[Darrel R. Falk]] of [[Point Loma Nazarene]] published a similar book in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;''Coming to Peace with Science: Bridging the Worlds Between Faith and Biology'', InterVarsity Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8308-2742-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Giberson]] of [[Eastern Nazarene]], the first Nazarene scholar to publish with [[Oxford University Press]], has published four books since 1993 on the tensions between science and religion,&lt;ref&gt;''Worlds Apart: The Unholy War between Religion and Science'', Beacon Hill Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8341-1504-2}}&lt;br&gt;With [[Donald Yerxa]], ''Species of Origins: America's Search for a Creation Story'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2002 {{ISBN|0-7425-0764-5}}&lt;br&gt;With [[Mariano Artigas]], ''The Oracles of Science: Celebrity Scientist Versus God and Religion'', Oxford University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-531072-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; including his most recently published ''Saving Darwin''.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt;

Theologians of note in the denomination whose work on science and religion shows the promise of cooperation include [[Thomas Jay Oord]] (''Science of Love'', ''[[The Altruism Reader]]'', ''Defining Love''), [[Michael Lodahl]] (''[[God of Nature and of Grace]]''), and [[Samuel M. Powell]] (''[[Participating in God]]'').  These theologians see no major problem reconciling theology with the general theory of evolution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Nazarene ''Manual'', a document crafted to provide Biblical guidance and denominational expression for Church members, states: "The Church of the Nazarene believes in the biblical account of creation ("In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . ."—Genesis 1:1). We oppose any godless interpretation of the origin of the universe and of humankind. However, the church accepts as valid all scientifically verifiable discoveries in geology and other natural phenomena, for we firmly believe that God is the Creator. (Articles I.1., V. 5.1, VII.) (2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf Manual, p.371] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302214359/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf |date=2013-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Eastern Orthodox Church =====
The Eastern Orthodox Church is divided in two large categories, which might be labeled as compatibilism and dualism.

On the one hand, compatibilists hold that evolutionary science and theology are compatible and view them as complementary revelations of God. As God is the source of both his specific revelation of himself in the Christian faith and the source of the general revelation of himself in nature, the findings of science and theology cannot really contradict; the contradictions must be merely apparent and a resolution possible which is faithful to the truth of God's revelation.
Nicozisin (Father George) is a compatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/dogmatics/nicozisin_creationism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, dualists hold that evolution can be incompatible with faith. They usually argue either that evolutionary science is philosophically based on a kind of naturalism or that God's specific revelation is infallible and therefore trumps the findings of human reason in the case of any conflict between them. This is often based on a suspicion of human reason to arrive at reliable conclusions in the first place. Their stance is somewhat similar to [[Averroism]], in that there is one truth, but it can be arrived at through (at least) two different paths, namely Philosophy and Religion.
Bufeev, S. V, is a dualist, preferring to see the spiritual level above the mechanical, physico-chemical, or biological levels; he attributes discrepancies between spiritual matters and scientific matters to be because of the purely naturalistic views of evolutionists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creatio.orthodoxy.ru/sbornik/sbufeev_whynot_english.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Roman Catholic Church =====
{{Main article|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}
The position of the Roman Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has changed over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the early-1950s, to limited guarded acceptance in recent years, rejecting the materialistic and reductionist philosophies behind it, and insisting that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single human ancestor (commonly called [[Monogenesis (disambiguation)|monogenism]]) for all of mankind. The Church does not argue with scientists on matters such as the [[age of the earth]] and the authenticity of the [[fossil record]], seeing such matters as outside its area of expertise. Papal pronouncements, along with commentaries by cardinals, indicate that the Church is aware of the general findings of scientists on the gradual appearance of life.  Indeed, Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]], astronomer and physics professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]], was the first to propose the theory of [[expansion of the universe]], often incorrectly credited to [[Edwin Hubble]]. In the 1950 [[encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]'', [[Pope Pius XII]] confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that the individual [[soul]] is a direct creation by [[God in Christianity|God]] and not the product of purely material forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Catholics and the Evolving Cosmos |first=John |last=Farrell |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703846604575447493644515142 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 27, 2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013|alt=Today}}, many members of the Church supports [[theistic evolution]](ism), also known as ''evolutionary creation'',&lt;ref name="Alberta"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lastseminary.com/genesis-modern-science/Evolutionary%20Creation.pdf|title =Evolutionary Creation|quote=Evolutionary creation best describes the official position of the Roman Catholic Church, though it is often referred to in this tradition as 'theistic evolution.'|publisher = [[University of Alberta]]|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], the International Theological Commission published a paper accepting the [[Big Bang|big bang]] of 15 billion years ago and the evolution of all life including humans from the microorganisms that formed approximately 4 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;"Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God."

=== Deism ===
{{See also|Deism}}
[[Deism]] is belief in a [[God]] or [[first cause]] based on [[reason]], rather than on [[faith]] or [[revelation]]. Most deists{{Who|date=June 2012}} believe that God does not interfere with the world or create [[miracle]]s. Some deists{{Who|date=June 2012}} believe that a [[Divine Creator]] initiated a universe in which evolution occurred, by designing the system and the natural laws, although many deists believe that God also created life itself, before allowing it to be subject to evolution. They find it to be undignified and unwieldy for a deity to make constant adjustments rather than letting evolution elegantly adapt organisms to changing environments.

One recent convert to deism was philosopher and professor [[Antony Flew]], who became a deist in December 2004. Professor Flew, a former [[atheist]], later argued that recent research into the origins of life supports the theory that some form of intelligence was involved. Whilst accepting subsequent Darwinian evolution, Flew argued that this cannot explain the complexities of the origins of life. He also stated that the investigation of [[DNA]] "has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/atheist_philosopher_041210.html Atheist Philosopher, 81, Now Believes in God | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently clarified this statement in an interview with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005: "What I was converted to was the existence of an [[Aristotelian view of God|Aristotelian God]], and Aristotle's God had no interest in human affairs at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/belief/scripts/antony_flew.html BBC interview, Professor Antony Flew] March 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2012}}&lt;!-- No evidence that Flew is a TE, so how is this paragraph relevant? --&gt;&lt;!-- He accepts evolution, but believes in a deity. --&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
{{See also|Hindu views on evolution}}
Hindu views on evolution include a range of viewpoints with regard to [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]] within the traditions of [[Hinduism]]. The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary, but classically tell of the [[deity]] called [[Brahma]], from a [[Trimurti]] of three deities also including [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], performing the act of "creation", or more specifically of "propagating life within the universe". with the other two deities responsible for "preservation" and "destruction" (of the universe) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;

Some Hindus{{Who|date=June 2012}} find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]], namely the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact?

==== Day and night of Brahma ====
Science writers [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Fritjof Capra]] have pointed out similarities between the latest scientific understanding of the age of the universe, and the Hindu concept of a "day and night of Brahma", which is much closer to the current known age of the universe than other creation myths. The days and nights of Brahma posit a view of the universe that is divinely created, and is not strictly evolutionary, but an ongoing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth of the universe. According to Sagan:
{{quotation|The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only religion in which time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long, longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sagan | first =Carl | authorlink =Carl Sagan | title =[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]] | publisher =Ballantine Books | year =1985 | isbn =978-0-345-33135-9 }} p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Capra, in his popular book ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'', wrote that:
{{quotation|This idea of a periodically expanding and contracting universe, which involves a scale of time and space of vast proportions, has arisen not only in modern cosmology, but also in ancient Indian mythology. Experiencing the universe as an organic and rhythmically moving cosmos, the Hindus were able to develop evolutionary cosmologies which come very close to our modern scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Capra | first =Fritjof | authorlink =Fritjof Capra | title =[[Tao of Physics]] | publisher =Shambhala | year =1991 | isbn =978-0-87773-594-6 }} p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Daśāvatāras and evolution ====
The British geneticist and evolutionary biologist [[J B S Haldane]] observed that the Dasavataras (ten principal avatars of Lord [[Vishnu]]) provide a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of [[evolution]]. The avatars of [[Vishnu]] show an uncanny similarity to the biological theory of evolution of life on earth.&lt;ref&gt;

Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Lord Buddha were the seventh, eighth and ninth other avatars of Lord Vishnu. It indicates the physical and mental changes and evolution in the man from its time of appearance.

=== Islam ===
{{See also|Islamic creationism}}
Some literalist Muslims{{Who|date=June 2012}} reject origin of species from a common ancestor by evolution as incompatible with the [[Qur'an]]. However, even amongst Muslims who accept evolution, many believe that humanity was a special creation by God. For example, Shaikh Nuh Ha Mim Keller, an American Muslim and specialist in Islamic law has argued in ''Islam and Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/evolve.htm Evolution and Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a belief in [[macroevolution]] is not incompatible with Islam, as long as it is accepted that "Allah is the Creator of everything" (Qur'an 13:16) and that Allah specifically created humanity (in the person of Adam; Qur'an 38:71-76). Shaikh Keller states in his conclusion however:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As for claim that man has evolved from a non-human species, this is unbelief (kufr) no matter if we ascribe the process to Allah or to "nature," because it negates the truth of Adam's special creation that Allah has revealed in the Qur'an. Man is of special origin, attested to not only by revelation, but also by the divine secret within him, the capacity for ma'rifa or knowledge of the Divine that he alone of all things possesses. By his God-given nature, man stands before a door opening onto infinitude that no other creature in the universe can aspire to. Man is something else."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{See also|Judaism and evolution}}
In general, three of the four major [[Jewish denominations|denominations]] of American [[Judaism]] ([[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]) accept theistic evolution. Within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], there is much debate about the issue.  Most [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] groups accept theistic evolution and most [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox]] groups do not.  This disagreement was most vociferous in the [[Natan Slifkin#Controversy|Natan Slifkin controversy]] which arose when a number of prominent Ultra-Orthodox Rabbis banned books written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin which explored the idea of theistic evolution within Jewish tradition.  These Rabbis forming part of [[Jewish opposition to evolution]] considered that his books were [[heresy]] as they indicated that the [[Talmud]] is not necessarily correct about scientific matters such as the [[age of the Earth]].

Advocates of theistic evolution within Judaism follow two general approaches. Either the [[Genesis creation myth|creation account]] in the [[Torah]] is not to be taken as a literal text, but rather as a [[symbol]]ic work, or, alternatively, that the 'days' do not refer to 24-hour periods. The latter view, called [[day-age creationism]], is justified by how the first day in the biblical account actually precedes the creation of the sun and earth by which 24 hour days are reckoned and by how the seventh day of rest has no evening and morning. In the day-age view, Jewish [[scholars]] point out how the order of creation in Genesis corresponds to the scientific description of the development of life on Earth—the sun, then earth, then oceans, then oceanic plant life, fish preceding land-based life, with mammals and finally humans last—and in no way specifies the method of creation in a manner prohibitive of evolution.

[[Karaite Judaism]] is a Jewish a movement which is distinct in that they do not accept the [[Talmud]] (a series of Rabbinic commentaries) as law and follow the Hebrew scriptures as they are written. Karaites are currently divided on the question of evolution with many or most Karaite Jews leaning in favor of Theistic Evolution.

=== Samaritanism ===
The [[Samaritans]], a divergent branch of the Israelites (the other being the Jews), generally accept Theistic Evolution. Samaritans do not consider themselves to be Jewish, but hold similar beliefs. The Jews, however, hold the [[Tanakh]] (consisting of the [[Torah]] or [[Pentateuch]], plus [[Nevi'im]], and [[Ketuvim]]) as canonical scripture in conjunction with the Oral Law as compiled in the Talmud, while the Samaritan's canonical scriptures consists only of the Torah (a slightly differing Pentateuch, i.e. the Five Books of Moses), but exclude both Nevi'im and Ketuvim, as well as excluding the Talmud.

=== Pantheism ===
[[Pantheism|Pantheists]] (for instance in [[Naturalistic Pantheism]]) may view natural processes, including evolution, as work or emanations from the impersonal, non-anthropomorphic deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English  | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford  | pages =  1341|isbn = 0-19-861263-X  | mr =   | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deity"&gt;Owen, H.

=== Evolutionary biologists who were also theists ===
Although [[evolutionary biologists]] have often been [[agnostics]] (most notably [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]]) or [[Atheism|atheists]] (most notably [[Richard Dawkins]]), from the outset many have had a belief in some form of theism. These have included [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823&amp;ndash;1913), who in a joint paper with [[Charles Darwin]] in 1858, proposed the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. Wallace, in his later years, was effectively a [[deist]] who believed that "the unseen universe of Spirit" had interceded to create life as well as consciousness in animals and (separately) in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fichman, (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2E293wQ63AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace]''. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin had a longstanding close friendship with the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] who was a leading supporter of Darwin's theory, and a devout Presbyterian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/religion-historical-resources |title=Historical Resources |year=2009 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray wrote a series of essays on the relationship of natural selection to religious belief and [[natural theology]], and supported the views of theologians who said that design through evolution was inherent in all forms of life.&lt;ref name=Grayreviews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/essays-reviews-by-asa-gray |title=Essays &amp; reviews by Asa Gray |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/gray-essay-evolution-theology |title=Essay: Evolution &amp; theology |author=Asa Gray |authorlink=Asa Gray |date=January 15, 1874 |work= Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=The Nation |pages= |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin had Gray and [[Charles Kingsley]] in mind when he wrote that "It seems to me absurd to doubt that a man may be an ardent theist &amp; an evolutionist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 |title=Letter 12041 — Darwin, C. R. to Fordyce, John, 7 May 1879 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhA2bpBR?url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 |archivedate=2014-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of this kind of approach came from computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] who published his unofficial ''Ninth [[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required.

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881&amp;ndash;1955) was a noted geologist and paleontologist as well as a [[Jesuit]] Priest who wrote extensively on the subject of incorporating evolution into a new understanding of Christianity. Initially suppressed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], his theological work has had considerable influence and is widely taught in Catholic and most [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] seminaries.

Both [[Ronald Fisher]] (1890&amp;ndash;1962) and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] (1900&amp;ndash;1975), were Christians and architects of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Dobzhansky, a Russian Orthodox, wrote a famous 1973 essay entitled ''[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]'' espousing evolutionary creationism:

:"I am a creationist and an evolutionist. Evolution is God's, or Nature's, method of creation. Creation is not an event that happened in 4004 BC; it is a process that began some 10 billion years ago and is still under way... Does the evolutionary doctrine clash with religious faith? It does not. It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology. Only if symbols are construed to mean what they are not intended to mean can there arise imaginary, insoluble conflicts... the blunder leads to blasphemy: the Creator is accused of systematic deceitfulness."

In the realm of biology and theology, the saying coined by [[Thomas Jay Oord]] is perhaps appropriate: "The Bible tells us how to find abundant life, not the details of how life became abundant."

{{Nihongo|'''Amamikyu'''|阿摩美久&lt;ref&gt;Shō Shōken. ''Chūzan Seikan'' (in Japanese). 1650.&lt;/ref&gt; or 阿摩彌姑&lt;ref&gt;Tei Heitetsu. ''Kyūyō'' (in Chinese). 1745.&lt;/ref&gt;||[[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]: Amanchuu}}, or {{Nihongo|'''Amekushin-otome-ōankami'''|天久神乙女王御神}}, is the creation goddess of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in the [[Ryukyuan religion]].

==Name==
Amamikyu's name comes from the reading of the [[Chinese characters]] 阿摩美久 or 阿摩彌姑, which were most likely written [[ad-hoc]] for the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan pronunciation]]. Readings can vary widely from Amamikyu, Amamikyo, Amamikiyo, Amamiko, Amamiku, Amamigu, Amamichuu, and Amanchuu. "Amamikyu" was used by [[George H. Kerr]] in his ''Ryukyu: Kingdom and Province Before 1945'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, George. ''Okinawa:History of an Island People''. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Publishing, 1958. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation myth==
The beginning of ''[[Chūzan Seikan]]'' details the creation of the Ryukyu Islands. The Heavenly Emperor (天帝), who lived in the Heavenly [[Gusuku]] (天城), looked down on the world and saw that there were no islands, so he ordered Amamikyu (阿摩美久) to create the Ryukyu Islands. She asked for materials to build the islands, so the Heavenly Emperor sent Shinerikyu to bring her grasses, trees, and stones. She descended to Earth on [[Kudaka Island]], and then made landfall on [[Okinawa Island]] on the spot of [[Sefa-utaki]], and later built [[Tamagusuku Castle]] and [[Chinen Castle]] and a number of communities. She asked the Heavenly Emperor for materials to make people, but the other gods would not go down to Earth. Without sexual intercourse, she became pregnant by Shinerikyu (志仁禮久) and populated the islands. Some generations later, a "heavenly grandchild" named Tentei was born, who split Ryukyuan society into five classes with his three sons and two daughters: the first son was [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Tenson Dynasty|Tenson]], who became the first King of Ryukyu; the second son became the first feudal lord ([[Anji (Ryukyu)|Aji]]); the third son became the first farmer; the first daughter became the first royal [[noro (priestess)|noro priestess]]; and the second daughter became the first village noro priestess.&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, Clarence. ''The Great Loochoo''. University of California Press, 1955. Pp 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Her final home was located at [[Minton Castle]] in [[Tamagusuku, Okinawa]].

==Historical legacy==
Amamikyu's tomb is located on [[Hamahiga Island]] in [[Uruma, Okinawa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nifee.net/piman/ha-rekisi.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sefa-utaki is the holiest [[utaki]] site in the Ryukyuan religion. During the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] era, the king and [[kikoe-ōgimi]] made an annual [[pilgrimage]] to the site from [[Shuri Castle]] to worship Amamikyu, facing [[Kudaka Island]].

'''Apologetics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀπολογία}}, "speaking in defense") is the religious discipline of defending [[religious doctrine]]s through systematic [[argument]]ation and discourse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G627 |title=ἀπολογία |work=Blue Letter Bible-Lexicon |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01618a.htm |title=Apologetics |date= |website=The Advent |publisher= |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apologetics |title=apologetics |date= |website=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |publisher= |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of early Christian writers|Early Christian writers]] (c. 120–220) who defended their beliefs against [[criticism of Christianity|critics]] and recommended their [[faith]] to outsiders were called [[Christian apologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Apologists |editor1-last=Cross |editor1-first=F.&amp;nbsp;L. |editor1-link=Frank Leslie Cross |work=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 21st-century usage, ''apologetics'' is often identified with debates over [[religion]] and [[theology]].

==Etymology==
The term ''apologetics'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''apologia''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the Classical Greek legal system, two key technical terms were employed: the prosecution delivered the ''kategoria'' (κατηγορία), and the defendant replied with an ''apologia''. To deliver an ''apologia'' meant making a formal speech or giving an explanation to reply and rebut the charges, as in the case of [[Socrates]]' [[Apology (Plato)|Apologia]] defense, as chronicled in [[Apology (Plato)|Plato's ''Apology'']] (the defense speech of [[Socrates]] at his trial).  This term appears in the [[Koine Greek]] of the [[New Testament]]. The [[Apostle Paul]] employs the term ''apologia'' in his trial speech to [[Porcius Festus|Festus]] and [[Agrippa I|Agrippa]] when he says "I make my defense" in [[Acts 26]]:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/26/2/s_1044002|title=Acts 26:2|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cognate]] form appears in Paul's [[Letter to the Philippians]] as he is "defending the gospel" in Philippians 1:7,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/phl/1/7/s_1104007|title=Phl 1:7|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in "giving an answer" in 1 Peter 3:15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/3/15/s_1154015|title=1Pe 3:15|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''apologetics'' has Western, primarily Christian origins and is most frequently associated with the defense of Christianity, the term is sometimes used referring to the defense of any religion in formal debate involving religion.

== Apologetic positions ==

===Bahá'í===
{{main article|Bahá'í apologetics}}
Many [[Bahá'í literature#Apologia|apologetic books]] have been written in defence of the history or teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. The religion's founders wrote several books presenting proofs of their religion, among them are the [[Báb]]'s ''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Dalá'il-i-Sab'ih (The Seven Proofs)|Seven Proofs]]'' and [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]''.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= apologetics |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 39–40 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Bahá'í authors wrote prominent apologetic texts, such as [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]]'s ''The Brilliant Proof'' and [[Udo Schaefer]] et al.'s ''Making the Crooked Straight'';.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/cannuyer_schaefer_desinformation|title=Making the Crooked Straight, by Udo Schaefer, Nicola Towfigh, and Ulrich Gollmer|work=bahai-library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
One of the earliest Buddhist apologetic texts is ''[[Milinda Panha|The Questions of King Milinda]]'', which deals with the Buddhist metaphysics such as the "no-self" nature of the individual and characteristics such as of wisdom, perception, volition, feeling, consciousness and the soul. In the mid-19th century, encounters between Buddhists and Christians in [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] prompted the formation of a Buddhist Propagation Society {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. In recent times, A.&amp;nbsp;L. De Silva, an Australian convert to [[Buddhism]], has written a book, ''Beyond Belief'', providing Buddhist apologetic responses and a critique of Christian Fundamentalist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/beyond-belief02.pdf|title=Beyond Belief, a Buddhist Critique of Fundamentalist Christianity|last=De Silva|first=A.&amp;nbsp;L.|publisher=Three Gems Publications, ebook link at Buddha Dharma Education Association Incorporated, also|year=1994|isbn=978-0-6462-1211-1|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunapala Dharmasiri wrote an apologetic critique of the [[God in Christianity|Christian concept of God]] from a [[Theravada|Theravadan Buddhist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God : a critique of the concept of God in contemporary Christian theology and philosophy of religion from the point of view of early Buddhism|last=Dharmasiri|first=Gunapala|publisher=Colombo : Lake House Investments|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian apologetics combines [[Christian theology]], [[natural theology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/theo-nat/ | title=Natural Theology | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=10 March 2015 | author=Brent, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[philosophy]] to present a rational basis for the Christian faith, to defend the faith against objections and misrepresentation.

Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries. In the [[Roman Empire]], Christians were severely persecuted, and many charges were brought against them. J. David Cassel&lt;ref&gt;J. David Cassel. "Defending the Cannibals: How Christians responded to the sometimes strange accusations of their critics." {{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1998/issue57/57h012.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821133320/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1998/issue57/57h012.html |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives several examples: [[Tacitus]] wrote that [[Nero]] fabricated charges that Christians started the [[Great Fire of Rome|burning of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals XV.44&lt;/ref&gt; Other charges included [[cannibalism]] (due to a literal interpretation of the [[Eucharist]]) and [[incest]] (due to early Christians' practice of addressing each other as "brother" and "sister"). [[Saul of Tarsus]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and others often defended Christianity against charges that were brought to justify persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianity.com/church/church-history/timeline/1-300/why-early-christians-were-despised-11629610.html|title=Why Early Christians Were Despised|last=|first=|date=|website=Christianity Today (Church history timeline).|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later apologists have focused on providing reasons to accept various aspects of Christian belief. Christian apologists of many traditions, in common with Jews, Muslims, and some others, argue for the existence of a unique and personal God. [[Theodicy]] is one important aspect of such arguments, and [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s arguments have been highly influential in this area. Many prominent Christian apologists are scholarly philosophers or theologians, frequently with additional doctoral work in [[physics]], [[cosmology]], [[comparative religions]], or other fields. Others take a more popular or pastoral approach. Some prominent modern apologists are [[Douglas Groothuis]], [[Frederick Copleston]], [[John Lennox]], [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter R. Martin]], [[Dinesh D'Souza]], [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]], [[Cornelius Van Til]], [[Gordon Clark]], [[Francis Schaeffer]], [[Greg Bahnsen]], [[Edward John Carnell]], [[James White (theologian)|James White]], [[R.C. Sproul]], [[Hank Hanegraaff]], [[Ravi Zacharias]], [[Alister McGrath]], [[Lee Strobel]], [[Josh McDowell]], [[Peter Kreeft]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[J. P. Moreland]], [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], [[David Bentley Hart]], [[Gary Habermas]], [[Norman Geisler]] and [[Scott Hahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0088.html/ Catholic Education Resource Center: ''The Scott Hahn Conversion Story''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718093548/http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0088.html/ |date=July 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable apologists within the [[Catholic Church]] include [[Robert Barron (bishop)|Bishop Robert Barron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordonfire.org/about/fr-robert-barron/|title=Page Not Found - Word On Fire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G.

[[John Henry Newman]] (February 21, 1801 – August 11, 1890) was an English convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], later made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and [[beatified]] in 2010. In early life he was a major figure in the [[Oxford Movement]] to bring the [[Church of England]] back to its Catholic roots.  Eventually his studies in history persuaded him to become a Roman Catholic. When John Henry Newman entitled his spiritual autobiography ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in 1864, he was playing upon both this connotation, and the more commonly understood meaning of an expression of contrition or regret.

Christian apologists employ a variety of philosophical and formal approaches, including [[Ontological argument|ontological]], [[Cosmological argument|cosmological]], and [[teleological argument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bethinking.org/apologetics/an-introduction-to-christian-apologetics?Strongs=G627|title=An Introduction to Christian Apologetics|last=Coulter|first=Paul|date=|website=Bethinking|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian presuppositionalist approach to apologetics utilizes the [[transcendental argument for the existence of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief

[[Tertullian]] was a notable early [[Christian]] apologist. He was born, lived and died in [[Carthage]]. He is sometimes known as the "Father of the [[Latin Church]]". He introduced the term ''[[Trinity]]'' ([[Latin]] ''trinitas'') to the Christian vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Christian Thought'', [[Paul Tillich]], Touchstone Books, 1972. {{ISBN|0-671-21426-8}} (p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt; and also probably{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} the formula "three Persons, one Substance" as the Latin "tres [[Persona]]e, [[Consubstantial|una Substantia]]" (itself from the [[Koine Greek]] "treis [[Hypostasis (religion)|Hypostaseis]], [[Ousios|Homoousios]]"), and also the terms ''Vetus Testamentum'' ([[Old Testament]]) and ''Novum Testamentum'' ([[New Testament]]).

====Mormonism====
{{further information|Mormon studies#Apologetics}}
There are notable Latter-day Saint apologists who focus on the defense of [[Mormonism]], including early church leaders such as [[Parley P. Pratt]], [[John Taylor (1808-1887)|John Taylor]], [[B.&amp;nbsp;H. Roberts]], [[James E. Talmage]] and more modern figures such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]].

Several well-known Mormon apologetic organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (a group of scholars at [[Brigham Young University]]) and [[FairMormon]] (an independent, Mormon-run, not-for-profit group), have been formed to defend the doctrines and history of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in general and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in particular.

=== Deism ===
[[Deism]] is a form of [[theism]] in which God created the universe and established rationally comprehensible moral and natural laws but no longer intervenes in human affairs. Deism is a [[natural religion]] where belief in God is based on application of reason and evidence observed in the designs and laws found in nature.&lt;sup&gt;[[Criticism of atheism#cite note-12|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt;  The World Order of Deists maintains a web site presenting deist apologetics that demonstrate the existence of God based on evidence and reason, absent divine revelation.

===Hinduism===
Hindu apologetics began developing during the British colonial period.  A number of Indian intellectuals had become critical of the British tendency to devalue the Hindu religious tradition. As a result, these Indian intellectuals, as well as a handful of British [[Indology|Indologists]], were galvanized to examine the roots of the religion as well as to study its vast arcana and corpus in an analytical fashion. This endeavor drove the deciphering and preservation of [[Sanskrit]]. Many translations of Hindu texts were produced which made them accessible to a broader reading audience.

A range of Indian philosophers, including [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Aurobindo Ghose]], have written rational explanations regarding the values of the Hindu religious tradition. More modern proponents such as the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] have also tried to correlate recent developments from [[quantum physics]] and [[consciousness]] research with Hindu concepts. The late Reverend [[Pandurang Shastri Athavale]] has given a plethora of discourses regarding the symbolism and rational basis for many principles in the [[Veda|Vedic tradition]]. In his book ''The Cradle of Civilization'', David Frawley, an American who has embraced the Vedic tradition, has characterized the ancient texts of the Hindu heritage as being like "pyramids of the spirit". [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures including the biography and conclusions of the famous 16th century bhakti scholar [[Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]; many of these translations and commentaries have been further translated into as many as eighty languages, producing over half a billion books distributed throughout the world. Such individuals have tried to construct an intellectual defense of [[Hinduism]] during a phase when the [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalistic]] elements of other faiths have sought to denigrate the ancient religion in an effort to gain converts.

===Judaism===
{{See also|Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages}}
Jewish apologetic literature can be traced back as far as [[Aristobulus of Paneas]], though some discern it in the works of [[Demetrius the chronographer]] (3rd century BCE) traces of the style of "questions" and "solutions" typical of the genre. Aristobulus was a Jewish philosopher of [[Alexandria]] and the author of an apologetic work addressed to [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]]. [[Josephus]]'s [[Contra Apion]] is a wide-ranging defense of [[Judaism]] against many charges laid against Judaism at that time, as too are some of the works of [[Philo of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;John Granger Cook (2000) ''The Interpretation of the New Testament in Greco-Roman paganism'' p.4., Mohr Siebeck Verlag, Tuebingen, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1651-apologists|title=APOLOGISTS|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==
Plato's ''Apology'' may be read as both a religious and literary apology; however, more specifically literary examples may be found in the [[preface]]s and [[dedication]]s, which proceed many [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] plays, novels, and poems. Eighteenth century authors such as [[Colley Cibber]], [[Frances Burney]], and [[William Congreve]], to name but a few, prefaced the majority of their poetic work with such apologies. In addition to the desire to defend their work, the apologetic preface often suggests the author's attempt to humble his- or herself before the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30105/apology|title=Apology|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|work=Britannica Academic Edition|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apotheosis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀποθέωσις from ἀποθεοῦν, ''apotheoun'' "to deify"; in Latin ''deificatio'' "making divine"; also called '''divinization''' and '''deification''') is the glorification of a subject to [[divinity|divine]] level. The term has meanings in [[theology]], where it refers to a [[belief]], and in [[art]], where it refers to a [[genre]].

In theology, ''apotheosis'' refers to the idea that an individual has been raised to godlike stature. In art, the term refers to the treatment of any subject (a figure, group, locale, motif, convention or melody) in a particularly grand or exalted manner.

==Antiquity==
{{further information|imperial cult|divine king}}
Before the Hellenistic period, [[imperial cult]]s were known in [[Ancient Egypt]] ([[pharaoh]]s) and [[Mesopotamia]] (since [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]). From the [[New Kingdom]], all deceased pharaohs were deified as the god [[Osiris]].

==Ancient Greece==
{{Main article|Greek hero cult}}
From at least the [[Geometric art|Geometric]] period of the ninth century BC, the long-deceased heroes linked with [[founding myth]]s of Greek sites were accorded [[chthonic]] rites in their ''[[heroon]]'', or "hero-temple".

In the Greek world, the first leader who accorded himself divine honours was [[Philip II of Macedon]]. At his wedding to his sixth wife, Philip's enthroned image was carried in procession among the [[Olympian gods]]; "his example at [[Vergina|Aigai]] became a custom, passing to the Macedonian kings who were later worshipped in [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek Asia]], from them to [[Julius Caesar]] and so to the emperors of Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' (1973:20)&lt;/ref&gt; Such Hellenistic state leaders might be raised to a status equal to the gods before death (e.g., [[Alexander the Great]]) or afterwards (e.g., members of the
[[Ptolemaic dynasty]]). A heroic cult status similar to apotheosis was also an honour given to a few revered artists of the distant past, notably [[Homer]].

Archaic and Classical Greek hero-cults became primarily civic, extended from their familial origins, in the sixth century; by the fifth century none of the worshipers based their authority by tracing descent back to the hero, with the exception of some families who inherited particular priestly cults, such as the [[Eumolpides]] (descended from [[Eumolpus]]) of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]], and some inherited priesthoods at [[oracle|oracle site]]s. The Greek hero cults can be distinguished on the other hand from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|cult of dead emperors]], because the hero was not thought of as having ascended to Olympus or become a god: he was beneath the earth, and his power purely local.  For this reason hero cults were [[chthonic]] in nature, and their rituals more closely resembled those for [[Hecate]] and [[Persephone]] than those for [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]]. Two exceptions were [[Heracles]] and [[Asclepius]], who might be honoured as either gods or heroes, sometimes by chthonic night-time rites and sacrifice on the following day.

==Ancient Rome==
{{main article|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}
Up to the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], Romans accepted only one official apotheosis: the god [[Quirinus]], whatever his original meaning, having been identified with [[Romulus]].{{sfn|Garnett|Mackintosh|1911}} Subsequently, apotheosis in [[ancient Rome]] was a process whereby a deceased ruler was recognized as having been divine by his successor, usually also by a [[S.P.Q.R.|decree of the Senate and popular consent]]. In addition to showing respect, often the present ruler deified a popular predecessor to legitimize himself and gain popularity with the people. The upper-class did not always take part in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]],{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and some privately ridiculed the apotheosis of inept and feeble emperors, as in the satire ''[[The Pumpkinification of Claudius|The Pumpkinification of (the Divine) Claudius]]'', usually attributed to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].

At the height of the imperial cult during the [[Roman Empire]], sometimes the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]'s deceased loved ones—heirs, empresses, or lovers, as Hadrian's [[Antinous]]—were deified as well. Deified people were awarded posthumously the title ''Divus'' (''Diva'' if women) to their names to signify their divinity. [[Religion in ancient Rome|Traditional Roman religion]] distinguished between a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#deus, dea, di, dii|deus]]'' (god) and a ''[[divus]]'' (a mortal who became divine or deified), though not consistently. Temples and columns were erected to provide a space for worship.

==Ancient China==
The [[Ming dynasty]] epic ''[[Fengshen Yanyi|Investiture of the Gods]]'' deals heavily with deification legends. Numerous mortals have been deified into the [[Daoism|Daoist]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], such as [[Guan Yu]], [[Iron-crutch Li]] and [[Fan Kuai]]. [[Song Dynasty]] General [[Yue Fei]] was deified during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and is considered by some practitioners to be one of the three highest ranking heavenly generals.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, James T. C. "Yueh Fei (1103-41) and China's Heritage of Loyalty." ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 31, No. 2 (Feb., 1972), pp. 291-297, pg. 296

==Southeast Asia and North Korea==
Various Hindu and Buddhist rulers in the past have been represented as deities, especially after death, from [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thailand]] to [[Indonesia]].  Even several [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Sultans of Yogyakarta]] were semi-deified{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, posthumously.

Deceased North Korean leader [[Kim Il-Sung]] is the principal object of the [[North Korean cult of personality]] in which he is treated similarly to an explicitly apotheosized leader, with statues of and monuments dedicated to the "[[Eternal President]]", the annual commemoration of his birth, the paying of respects by newlyweds to his nearest statue,&lt;ref name="North Korean newlywed couples in their best attire bow before the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang"&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/domain/nimg.sulekha.com/search?q=North+Korean+newlywed+couples+in+their+best+attire+bow+before+the+statues+of+Kim+Il+Sung+and+Kim+Jong+Il+in+Pyongyang], Photograph of North Korean newlywed couples in their best attire bowing before the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, from Reddit.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[North Korean calendar]] being a [[Juche]] calendar based on Kim Il-sung's date of birth.

===Generally===
{{main article|Divinization (Christian)}}
Instead of the word "apotheosis", Christian theology uses in English the words "deification" or "divinization" or the Greek word "''theosis''". Traditional mainstream theology, both East and West, views [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] as the preexisting God who undertook mortal existence, not as a mortal being who attained divinity. It holds that he has made it possible for human beings to be raised to the level of sharing the divine nature: he became one of us to make us "partakers of the divine nature"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; "For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[Irenaeus of Lyon]], ''Adversus haereses'', 3.19.1&lt;/ref&gt; "For He was made man that we might be made God."&lt;ref name="AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3"&gt;St. Athanasius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html ''On the Incarnation of the Word'' 54.3] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QWCtlc7G?url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html |date=2007-07-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]], Opusc. 57, 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology contains the following in an article titled "Deification":

:''Deification (Greek theosis) is for Orthodoxy the goal of every Christian. Man, according to the Bible, is 'made in the image and likeness of God.'. . . It is possible for man to become like God, to become deified, to become god by grace. This doctrine is based on many passages of both OT and NT (e.g. Ps. 82 (81).6; II Peter 1.4), and it is essentially the teaching both of St Paul, though he tends to use the language of filial adoption (cf. Rom. 8.9—17; Gal. 4.5—7), and the Fourth Gospel (cf. 17.21—23).''

:''The language of II Peter is taken up by St Irenaeus, in his famous phrase, 'if the Word has been made man, it is so that men may be made gods' (Adv. Haer V, Pref.), and becomes the standard in Greek theology. In the fourth century, St. Athanasius repeats Irenaeus almost word for word, and in the fifth century St Cyril of Alexandria says that we shall become sons 'by participation' (Greek methexis). Deification is the central idea in the spirituality of St. Maximus the Confessor, for whom the doctrine is the corollary of the Incarnation: 'Deification, briefly, is the encompassing and fulfillment of all times and ages,' . . . and St. Symeon the New Theologian at the end of the tenth century writes, 'He who is God by nature converses with those whom he has made gods by grace, as a friend converses with his friends, face to face.' . . .''

===Eastern Christianity===
Eastern Christian theology does not use the term "apotheosis".{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Roman Catholic Church===
The Roman Catholic Church also does not use the term "apotheosis".

Corresponding to the Greek word ''theosis'' are the [[Latin]]-derived words "divinization" and "deification" used in the parts of the [[Catholic Church]] that are of Latin tradition. The concept has been given less prominence in Western theology than in that of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], but is present in the [[Latin Church]]'s liturgical prayers, such as that of the deacon or priest when pouring wine and a little water into the chalice: "By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article "deification"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] quotes with approval [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius's]] saying, "The Son of God became man so that we might become God."&lt;ref name="AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 460] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201419/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM |date=February 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic theology stresses the concept of supernatural life, "a new creation and elevation, a rebirth, it is a participation in and partaking of the divine nature"&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Fries, ''[http://www.google.com/search?q=Fries+Catholic+%22partaking+of+the+divine+nature%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Bultmann-Barth and Catholic theology]'' (Duquesne University Press 1967), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|ESV}}). In Catholic teaching there is a vital distinction between natural life and supernatural life, the latter being "the life that God, in an act of love, freely gives to human beings to elevate them above their natural lives" and which they receive through prayer and the sacraments; indeed the Catholic Church sees human existence as having as its whole purpose the acquisition, preservation and intensification of this supernatural life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22stephen+m.+o%27brien%22+%22supernatural+life%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Stephen M.

{{see also|Mormon cosmology|King Follett discourse}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church or [[Mormons]]) believes in apotheosis along the lines of the Christian tradition of [[divinization (Christian)|divinization]] or deification but refers to it as [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]], or eternal life, and considers it to be accomplished by "sanctification." It believes that people may live with God throughout eternity in families and eventually become gods themselves but remain subordinate to God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit. While the primary focus of the LDS Church is on [[Jesus of Nazareth]] and His atoning sacrifice for man,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith]] declared, "The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it" (See ''Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith'', sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 121).&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that one purpose for Christ's mission and for His atonement is the exaltation or [[Divinization (Christian)|Christian deification]] of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng | title = Gospel Topics: Becoming Like God | work = LDS.org | publisher = LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third Article of Faith of Mormon Christianity states that all men may be saved from sin by the atonement of Jesus Christ, and LDS Gospel Doctrine (as published) states that all men will be saved and will be resurrected from death. However, only those who are sufficiently obedient and accept the atonement and the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ before the resurrection and final judgment will be "exalted" and receive a literal Christian [[Divinization (Christian)|deification]].

Mormons believe that the original Christian belief in man's divine potential gradually lost its meaning and importance in the centuries after the death of the apostles, as doctrinal changes by post-apostolic theologians caused Christians to lose sight of the true nature of God and His purpose for creating humanity. The concept of God's nature that was eventually accepted as Christian doctrine in the 4th century set divinity apart from humanity by defining the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]] as three persons sharing a common divine substance. That classification of God in terms of a substance is not found in scripture&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mozley The creed or a philosophy 1893 p303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925052330/http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |archivedate=2014-09-25 |df= }} (the wording of the [[Council of Constantinople (360)]] prohibited use of the terms "substance," "essence," and "ousia" since they were not included in the scriptures)&lt;/ref&gt; but, in many aspects, mirrored the Greek metaphysical philosophies that are known to have influenced the thinking of Church Fathers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html#Aug|title=Trinity &gt; History of Trinitarian Doctrines (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], and [[Augustine]]. Mormons teach that by modern revelation, God restored the knowledge that He is the literal father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9) and that the Biblical references to God creating mankind in His image and likeness are in no way allegorical. As such, Mormons assert that as the literal offspring of God the Father (Acts 17:28-29), humans have the potential to be heirs of His glory and co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16-17). The glory, Mormons believe, lies not in God's substance but in His intelligence: in other words, light and truth (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 93|author=|date=|website=www.lds.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205003752/http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng|archivedate=2013-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus, the purpose of humans is to grow and progress to become like the Father in Heaven. Mortality is seen as a crucial step in the process in which God's spirit children gain a body, which, though formed in the image of the Father's body, is subject to pain, illness, temptation, and death. The purpose of this earth life is to learn to choose the right in the face of that opposition, thereby gaining essential experience and wisdom. The level of intelligence we attain in this life will rise in the Resurrection (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19). Bodies will then be immortal like those of the Father and the Son (Philippians 3:21), but the degree of glory to which each person will resurrect is contingent upon the Final Judgment (Revelation 20:13, 1 Corinthians 15:40-41). Those who are worthy to return to God's presence can continue to progress towards a fullness of God's glory, which Mormons refer to as eternal life, or [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] (Doctrine and Covenants 76).

The LDS concept of apotheosis/exaltation is expressed in LDS scriptures (Mosiah 3:19, Alma 13:12, D&amp;C 78:7, D&amp;C 78:22, D&amp;C 84:4, D&amp;C 84:23, D&amp;C 88:68, D&amp;C 93:28) and is expressed by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: "Though stretched by our challenges, by living righteously and enduring well we can eventually become sufficiently more like Jesus in our traits and attributes, that one day we can dwell in the Father's presence forever and ever" (Neal Maxwell, October 1997).

In early 2014, the LDS church published an essay on the official church website specifically addressing the foundations, history, and official beliefs regarding apotheosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng|title=Becoming Like God|first=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day|last=Saints|date=|website=www.lds.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129065539/https://www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay addresses the scriptural foundations of this belief, teachings of the early Church Fathers on the subject of deificiation, and the teachings of LDS church leaders, starting with Joseph Smith.

==In art==
In art the matter is practical: the elevation of a figure to divine level entails certain conventions. So it is that the apotheosis genre exists in Christian art as in other art. The features of the apotheosis genre may be seen in subjects that emphasize Christ's divinity ([[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], Christ [[Pantocrator]]) and that depict holy persons "in glory"—that is, in their roles as "God revealed" (Assumption, Ascension, etc.).

[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of French soldiers fallen in the Napoleonic Wars, [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], beginning of 19th century.]] [[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of George Washington]]

[[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Apotheosis of Homer, 1827.jpg|thumb|Ingres, ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''.]]
[[File:Apotheosis-of-saint-louis.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'', St. Louis MO]]
[[File:Allegory of Gdańsk trade.jpg|thumb|right|''Apotheosis of Gdańsk'' by [[Isaak van den Blocke]].]]

Later artists have used the concept for motives ranging from genuine respect for the deceased ([[Constantino Brumidi]]'s fresco ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' on the dome of the [[United States Capitol]] Building in [[Washington, D.C.]]), to artistic comment ([[Salvador Dalí]]'s or [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''), to [[mock-heroic]] and [[burlesque]] apotheoses for comedic effect.

Many modern leaders have exploited the artistic imagery if not the theology of apotheosis. Examples include [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s depictions of [[James I of England]] at the [[Banqueting House]] (an expression of the [[Divine Right of Kings]]) or [[Henry IV of France]], or Appiani's apotheosis of [[Napoleon]]. The [[Charles Henry Niehaus|C. H. Niehaus]]-designed ''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'' ([[Louis IX of France]]) became a symbol for St. Louis MO. The term has come to be used figuratively to refer to the elevation of a dead leader (often one who was assassinated and/or martyred) to a kind of superhuman charismatic figure and an effective erasing of all faults and controversies which were connected with his name in life - for example, [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[US]], [[Lenin]] in the [[USSR]], [[Yitzchak Rabin]] in [[Israel]], or [[Kim Jong-il]] in [[North Korea]].

==In music==
''Apotheosis'' in music refers to the appearance of a theme in grand or exalted form. It represents the musical equivalent of the apotheosis genre in visual art, especially where the theme is connected in some way with historical persons or dramatic characters. When crowning the end of a large-scale work the apotheosis functions as a [[peroration]], following an analogy with the art of [[rhetoric]].

Apotheosis moments abound in music, and the word itself appears in some cases. In the [[List of compositions by François Couperin]] there are 3 suites entitled "Apotheoses" (1724), [[Hector Berlioz]] used "Apotheose" as the title of the final movement of his ''Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale'', a work composed in 1846 for the dedication of a monument to France's war dead. Two of  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballets, ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', contain apotheoses as finales; the same is true of [[Ludwig Minkus]]'s ''[[La Bayadère]]''. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s composed [[Orpheus (ballet)]] and [[Apollo (ballet)]] for [[choreographer]] [[George Balanchine]] which both contain episodes entitled "Apotheose". The concluding tableau of [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Ma mère l'Oye]]'' is also titled  "Apotheose." Czech composer [[Karel Husa]], concerned in 1970 about arms proliferation and environmental deterioration, named his musical response ''Apotheosis for This Earth''. [[Aram Khachaturian]] entitled a segment of his ballet ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' "Sunrise and Apotheosis." [[Richard Wagner]], referring to the lively [[rhythm]]s which permeate [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], called it the "apotheosis of the dance".&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite book |title= Beethoven and his nine symphonies |last= Grove |first= Sir George |authorlink= George Grove |year= 1962 |publisher= [[Dover Publications]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |edition= 3rd |oclc= 705665 |pages= 228–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ballet ''[[The Seasons (ballet)|The Seasons]]'', Op.67 has as the concluding movement:-  Autumn: Scene and Apotheosis.

American [[technical death metal]] band [[The Faceless]] explored the idea of Apotheosis in the first three tracks of their 2012 album ''Autotheism''. The first three tracks are one song broken into three parts called "The Autotheism Movement".

[[File:Babalawo Opele opon.jpg|thumb]]

'''Babaaláwo''' or '''Babalawo '''('''Babalao''' or '''Babalaô''' in [[Latin America]]; literally meaning 'father of the mysteries' in the [[Yoruba language]]) is a spiritual title that denotes a [[priest]] of the [[Ifá]] [[oracle]]. Ifá is a [[divination]] system that represents the teachings of the [[Orisha|Òrìṣà]] [[Orunmila]], the Òrìṣà of Wisdom, who in turn serves as the oracular representative of [[Olodumare]]. A Babalawo's female counterpart is known as an '''[[Iyanifa]]'''.

==Functions in society==
The Babalawos ascertain the future of their clients through communication with Ifá. This is done through the interpretation of either the patterns of the [[divination|divining]] chain known as ''Opele'', or the sacred palm nuts called ''Ikin'', on the traditionally wooden divination tray called ''[[Opon Ifá]]''. 

In addition to this, some of them also perform divination services on behalf of the [[king]]s and [[paramount chief]]s of the [[Yoruba people]]. These figures, holders of [[chieftaincy]] titles like '''Araba''' and '''Oluwo Ifa''' in their own right, are members of the recognised [[aristocracy (class)|aristocracies]] of the various Yoruba [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]].

==Training==
Babalawos undergo training in the memorization and interpretation of the 256 ''[[Ifá#Od.C3.B9 If.C3.A1|Odu]]'' or mysteries, as well as in the numerous verses or ''Ese'' of Ifá. Traditionally, the Babalawo usually have additional professional specialties. For instance, several would also be [[herbalist]]s, while others would specialize in extinguishing the troubles caused by Ajogun. The Babalawos are, however, generally trained in the determination of problems, or to divine how good luck can be maintained, and the application of both spiritual and related secular solutions. Their primary function is to assist people in finding, understanding, and being in alignment with their individual destiny until they experience spiritual wisdom as a part of their daily experience. 

The Babalawo is charged with helping people develop the discipline and character that supports such spiritual growth called "Iwa Pele", or good character. This is done by identifying the client's spiritual destiny, or [[Ori (Yoruba)|Ori]], and developing a spiritual blueprint which can be used to support, cultivate, and live out that destiny.

'''Bibeltemplet''' (the Bible temple) is a [[Christian]] [[website]] in [[Sweden]], whose administrator Leif Liljeström was sentenced in April 2005 to two months in prison for holding and expressing critical views on [[homosexuality]]. The case was appealed twice, and the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] acquitted Liljeström in November 2007.

==Court of first instance==
According to the lower court in 2005, the administrator was guilty of "incitement against a group of people" for statements he himself had written, and for crime against "the law on [[Internet forum|electronic bulletin boards]]", for guest-messages which he neglected to delete. Liljeström told the court that his purpose is to preach the [[gospel]] and win people for [[Jesus]], and that the truth is needed to awake people. Among the statements that led to the verdict were the following: "The modern homophilia is the source and engine behind the [[AIDS]]-epidemic", and "AIDS is a punishment from [[God]] against [[sodomy]]". The view that there should be a "[[death penalty]] for homosexual acts" was also uttered on the website by a guest, but that was repudiated by Leif Liljeström directly in the forum. Still, he was convicted to prison also for the guest's statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/5/prweb239651.htm |title=Prison For {{sic|nolink=y|Critizism|expected=Criticism}} Against Homosexuality |publisher= [[PRWeb]] |date=2005-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71410.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals Court==
In April 2006, an appeals court in [[Gothenburg]] acquitted Liljestrom of the hate-speech and website content charges, but found him guilty of being an accomplice to hate-speech for allowing third parties to post offensive material on his website. The appeals court sentenced Liljestrom to one month's imprisonment.

==The Supreme Court==
Liljestrom then filed an appeal to the Gothenburg court decision. The Supreme Court in [[Stockholm]] decided to accept the case, and on November 7, 2007, after more than four years of struggle (counting from the day he was reported to the police in October, 2003), he was finally acquitted of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/9026/20071107/ The Local: "Christian web editor cleared of hate speech"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Ruth Gledhill]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2825811.ece |title=Christian web editor in gay row wins appeal |date=2007-11-07 |work=[[The Times]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has many similarities with the case of [[Åke Green]], and is expected to be seen as a guideline for coming justice in Sweden.

A '''chaplain''' is, traditionally, a [[cleric]] (such as a [[purohit]], [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], [[priest]], [[pastor]], [[rabbi]], or [[imam]]), or a [[laity|lay]] representative of a religious tradition, attached to a [[secularity|secular institution]] such as a [[hospital]], [[prison]], military unit, school, business, police department, fire department, [[university]], or private [[chapel]].

Though originally the word ''chaplain'' referred to representatives of the Christian faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chaplains.iphc.org/stories/etymology.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905050247/http://chaplains.iphc.org/stories/etymology.html |archivedate=September 5, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chaplaincy: the church's sector ministries|last=Legood|first=Giles|publisher=Cassell|year=1999|isbn=978-0304702954|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is now also applied to people of other religions or philosophical traditions–such as the case of chaplains serving with military forces and an increasing number of chaplaincies at American universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanistchaplaincies.org|title=Humanist Chaplaincies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, many lay people have received professional training in chaplaincy and are now appointed as chaplains in schools, hospitals, companies, universities, prisons and elsewhere to work alongside, or instead of, official members of the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, J. (2004). At The Heart of Education: School Chaplaincy and Pastoral Care. Dublin: Veritas.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of a ''multi-faith team'', ''secular'', ''generic'' and/or ''humanist'' chaplaincy are also gaining increasing use, particularly within healthcare and educational settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Multifaith Spaces: Management|work=[[University of Manchester]]|url=http://www.multi-faith-spaces.org|first=Chris|last=Hewson|date=March 1, 2012|accessdate=September 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015213253/http://www.multi-faith-spaces.org/#|archive-date=October 15, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of chaplaincies==

===Education===
School chaplains are a fixture in religious and, more recently, secular schools. In religious schools the role of the chaplain tends to be educational and liturgical. In secular schools the role of the chaplain tends to be that of a mentor and a provider of pastoral care services. Chaplains provide care for students by supporting them during times of crisis or need. Many chaplains run programs to promote the welfare of students, staff and parents including programs to help students deal with grief, anger or depression. Chaplains also build relationships with students by participating in extracurricular activities such as breakfast programs, lunchtime groups and sports groups. School chaplains can also liaise with external organisations providing support services for the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are school chaplains |url=http://www.tuggerahlakeschaplains.com/styled-3/index.html |publisher=Tuggerah Lakes Chaplains |accessdate=July 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125054025/http://www.tuggerahlakeschaplains.com/styled-3/index.html |archivedate=January 25, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With stagnant incomes and rising prices putting pressure on independent school budgets, cutting the post of school chaplain can seem an ''easy'' saving.{{citation needed|date=July 2014|reason=needed to confirm this is happening: prevalence? examples?}} Many schools now have pupil support departments with several mentors whose jobs are to look out for the pupils and always be there to help but they give no religious or spiritual guidance because of multiculturalism and diverse opinions on religion and beliefs.{{citation needed|date=July 2014|reason="many" is a weasel word, do they give "no" or "limited" spiritual guidance, are these really the reasons, anyway we need a source for this}} Chaplains have also been referred to as spiritual animators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torontosun.com/2013/10/11/religious-education-out-spiritual-animators-in-at-quebec-schools/wcm/14c2bdcd-0efd-4d55-b876-943cf528b11b|title=Religious education out, 'spiritual animators' in at Quebec schools|author=|date=October 11, 2013|website=torontosun.com|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also faith animators or pastoral animators)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylZKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=spiritual+animator|title=Global Perspectives on Spirituality and Education|editor1-first=Jacqueline|editor1-last=Watson|editor2-first=Marian de|editor2-last=Souza|editor3-first=Ann|editor3-last=Trousdale|first=Michael|last=Dallaire|chapter=Spirituality in Canadian Education | page=228 | date=December 4, 2013|publisher=[[Routledge]] | isbn =  9781136199127 | series=Routledge Research in Education | accessdate=April 26, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQGTTvm1HYYC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;lpg=PA334&amp;dq=pastoral+animator | title=International Handbook of Catholic Education: Challenges for School Systems in the 21st Century| isbn=9781402057762| last1=Grace| first1=Gerald| last2=Joseph| first2=SJ O'Keefe| date=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the French concept of ''animation spirituelle'' or spiritual care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JB6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=chaplains+as+animators|title=Issues in Religion and Education: Whose Religion?|editor1-first=Lori G. |editor1-last=Beaman | editor2-first=Leo Van | editor2-last=Arragon | date=February 5, 2015|publisher=[[Koninklijke Brill]] | location=Leiden | isbn= 9789004289819 | page=189 | accessdate=April 26, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia chaplains in state schools have, controversially,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-28/revised-chaplaincy-funding-moves-labelled-arrogant-disgraceful/5702012|title=Revised school chaplaincy funding arrangements labelled 'arrogant and disgraceful' by High Court challenger|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; been funded by the federal government and local communities since 2007. Australian chaplains assist school communities to support the spiritual, social, and emotional well-being of their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Chaplaincy |url=http://www.genr8.org.au/chaplains/about|location=Sydney |publisher=Genr8 Ministries |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplaincy services are provided by non denominational companies. {{As of|August 2013}} there are 2339 chaplains working in Australian secular schools, along with 512 student welfare workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 27, 2013 |title=National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program Statistics |url=http://docs.education.gov.au/documents/national-school-chaplaincy-and-student-welfare-program-statistics |publisher=Australian Government Department of Education |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Schools will lose the option of appointing secular social workers under the national school chaplaincy program, for which the Abbott government has found an extra $245m in [[2014 Australian federal budget|the 2014 budget]] funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hurst |first=Daniel |date=May 14, 2014 |title=It will be chaplains, not secular social workers, at schools |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/budget-it-will-be-chaplains-not-secular-social-workers-at-schools |work=The Guardian |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQGTTvm1HYYC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;lpg=PA334&amp;dq=pastoral+animator | title=International Handbook of Catholic Education: Challenges for School Systems in the 21st Century| isbn=9781402057762| last1=Grace| first1=Gerald| last2=Joseph| first2=SJ O'Keefe| date=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in Scotland the focus of school chaplaincy is on welfare and building positive relationships joining students on excursions and sharing meals. Chaplains are also non-denominational and act as a link between the school community and society. Like Australian chaplains it is expected that they will not proselytise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=Nov 13, 2012 |title=The Role of the School Chaplain |url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/13296/302_C_and_S_Reps_Handbook_Leaflet7.pdf |publisher=The Church of Scotland |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland chaplaincy takes a very different approach in which chaplains are expected to teach up to four hours of class instruction per week and are usually Catholic. Chaplaincy duties include visiting homes, religious services, retreats and celebrations, as well as counselling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The School Chaplain |url=http://www.irishschoolchaplains.com/page17.htm |publisher=School Chaplains' Association of Ireland |accessdate=July 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193011/http://www.irishschoolchaplains.com/page17.htm |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For higher education, chaplains are appointed by many colleges and universities, sometimes working directly for the institution, and sometimes as representatives of separate organizations that specifically work to support students, such as [[Hillel International]] for Jews or the [[Newman Centers]] for Catholics. In the United States, the National Association of College and University Chaplains works to support the efforts of many of these chaplains, helping chaplains minister to the individual faith of students, faculty, and staff, while promoting inter-religious understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NACUC Mission |url=http://www.nacuc.net/mission-of-NACUC/ |publisher=The National Association of College and University Chaplains |accessdate=July 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724190640/http://www.nacuc.net/mission-of-NACUC/ |archivedate=July 24, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplains often also oversee programs on campus that foster spiritual, ethical, religious, and political and cultural exchange, and the promotion of service. Each day communities respond to numerous disasters or emergencies. Most often, these incidents are managed effectively at the local level. However, there are some incidents that may require a collaborative approach that includes personnel from: 1. Multiple jurisdictions, 2. A combination of specialties or disciplines, 3. Several levels of government, 4. Non-governmental organizations, and 5. The private sector. Chaplain Fellowship Disaster Response certifies first responder chaplain for crisis and disaster response.

===Fire departments===
Chaplains working with fire departments provide the same kind of support as do chaplains working with law enforcement, and sometimes face even greater danger, working with the wounded in often very dangerous surroundings.

At the scene of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], for example, [[New York City Fire Department]] Chaplain [[Mychal Judge|Fr. Mychal F. Judge]] was killed by flying debris from the [[List of tenants in Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] when he re-entered the lobby of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the World Trade Center, shortly after administering last rites to a wounded firefighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/27/nyregion/killed-on-9-11-fire-chaplain-becomes-larger-than-life.html?pagewanted=1|title=Killed on 9/11, Fire Chaplain Becomes Larger Than Life|date=September 27, 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
Environmental chaplaincy is an emerging field within chaplaincy. Environmental chaplains (also known as eco-chaplains, Earth chaplains, nature chaplains) provide spiritual care in a way that honors humanity's deep connection to the earth. Environmental chaplains hold many roles. They may support people working on the frontlines of issues like climate change or other environmental issues or they may support people impacted by industrial or other disasters by providing pastoral care, presence, and rituals. Environmental chaplains may also bear witness to the Earth itself and represent the merging of science and spirituality. Their role can be to "usher in a new conscience and consciousness to find contentment, the appreciation of inner riches over outer wealth, quality over quantity" using universally appreciated values, such as honesty and vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chaplaincy Program Graduates |url=https://www.upaya.org/uploads/pdfs/Corinna.pdf |publisher=Upaya Zen Center |accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Vekasi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Work that Reconnects |url=http://ecochaplaincy.net/ecochaplaincy.html |publisher=the Eco-Chaplaincy Initiative |accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a vision of eco-chaplaincy inspired by [[Joanna Macy]]'s The Work that Reconnects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Work that Reconnects |url=http://workthatreconnects.org |publisher= The Work that Reconnects |accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saw eco-chaplaincy as a path to facilitating the "Great Turning," which is described as the turning away from a business-as-usual way of being and turning toward a life-sustaining way that protects people and the planet &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Great Turning |url=http://workthatreconnects.org/the-global-context/ |publisher= The Work that Reconnects |accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Many hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and hospices employ chaplains to assist with the spiritual, religious, and emotional needs of patients, families and staff. Chaplains are often employed at residential care facilities for the elderly (RCFE) and skilled nursing facilities (SNF) as well. Chaplains care for people of all faiths and no faith. In mental health work, chaplains are highly skilled,{{how|date=May 2018}} working with other therapists as part of a multi-disciplinary team, especially where the patient's mental ill-health is associated with their religiosity, or where their mental well-being can be aided by spiritual care.

In the [[United States]], health care chaplains who are board-certified have completed a minimum of four units of Clinical Pastoral Education training through The American Association of Pastoral Counselors,&lt;ref name="aapc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aapc.org|title=American Association of Pastoral Counselors - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Association for Clinical Pastoral Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpe.edu|title=Home|first=Advanced Solutions International,|last=Inc.|website=www.acpe.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare Chaplains Ministry Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcmachaplains.org|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for Clinical Pastoral Training,;&lt;ref name="certifiedchaplains.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.certifiedchaplains.org|title=Association of Certified Christian Chaplains - Home|website=www.certifiedchaplains.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or The College of Pastoral Supervision and Psychotherapy&lt;ref name="CPSP Pastoral Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsp.org|title=CPSP Pastoral Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be certified by one of the following organizations: The American Association of Pastoral Counselors,&lt;ref name="aapc.org"/&gt; The Association of Professional Chaplains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalchaplains.org|title=Association of Professional Chaplains|website=www.professionalchaplains.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Association of Catholic Chaplains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacc.org|title=Main Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neshama: Association of Jewish Chaplains (formerly The National Association of Jewish Chaplains),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.najc.org|title=Our Mission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of Certified Christian Chaplains,&lt;ref name="certifiedchaplains.org"/&gt; or The College of Pastoral Supervision and Psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="CPSP Pastoral Report"/&gt; Certification typically requires a Masters of Divinity degree (or its equivalent), faith group ordination or commissioning, faith group endorsement, and four units (1600 hours) of Clinical Pastoral Education (the [[Military Chaplains Association|Military Chaplains Association of the United States of America]] does require more, but they are a dod2088 501c-3 military support group founded in 1954 by Military Chaplains).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmca.homestead.com|title=Website Disabled|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, health care chaplains may be certified by the Canadian Association for Spiritual Care.

In the UK, health care chaplains are employed by their local [[NHS Trust]] (Health Boards in Scotland and Wales) or by [[charities]] associated with delivering health care such as a [[hospice]] or private hospital. The NHS in England publishes occasional guidance on chaplaincy practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nhs-chaplaincy-guidelines-2015.pdf|title=NHS Chaplaincy Guidelines 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=NHS England|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Chaplains are drawn from a range of faith and belief backgrounds, and are not necessarily ordained or a recognised faith leader. They may work on a full-time and [[part-time]] basis, and some work unpaid but with formal recognition for a faith or belief group regarding their training and status and may be termed ''honorary'' chaplain. The term ''Voluntary'' Chaplain is frowned on.{{By whom|date=October 2018}} The largest [[professional body]] for the UK is the College of Health Care Chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthcarechaplains.org/|title=Home - College of Health Care Chaplains|website=College of Health Care Chaplains}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland historically had a distinct professional body, the Scottish Association of Chaplains in Healthcare (SACH) but this has since dissolved. Northern Ireland also has the Healthcare Chaplains Association. Membership of the College of Health Care Chaplains was historically not open to Catholic Priests as it carries with it the  membership of the Unite [[Trade Union]], but this changed in April 2018. Chaplains working in a [[palliative care]] setting may also choose to join the Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpcc.org.uk/|title=AHPCC|website=www.ahpcc.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other less formal networks also exist supporting Chaplaincy in Paediatric settings and GP based Chaplaincy.

Within the UK there is also the UK Board of Healthcare Chaplaincy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukbhc.org.uk/|title=Welcome to the website of the UK Board of Healthcare Chaplaincy - UKBHC|website=www.ukbhc.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; (UKBHC) which has been set up in order to regulate the ministry and professional practice of health care chaplains. They publish a code of conduct which all registered chaplains are bound to abide by. The UKBHC has successfully applied to the Professional Standards Authority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/|title=Professional Standards Authority - Home|website=www.professionalstandards.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be an accredited register of healthcare chaplains demonstrating that it meets the Authority's high standards in areas such as governance and training.

Peer-reviewed journals that publish scholarly articles and research on healthcare chaplaincy include the ''Journal of Health Care Chaplaincy (USA)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/whcc20/current|title=Journal of Health Care Chaplaincy: Vol 23, No 3|website=www.tandfonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the international journal ''Health and Social Care Chaplaincy'' (UK) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/journals/hscc-parent/|title=Health and Social Care Chaplaincy - Equinox Publishing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Journal of Religion and Health'' (US)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Journal of Religion and Health (Springer, New York, USA)|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/10943|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is unfortunate however that many countries do not have their own professional chaplaincy journal. Nevertheless this does not mean that chaplaincy research is being confounded. Within Australia and New Zealand for example, there have been numerous exploratory studies producing scholarly articles regarding the spiritual care work of health care chaplains. This research has considered the role of chaplains in areas such as:  pain control, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Carey, L. B., Newell, C. J., &amp; Rumbold, B. (2006).

===Enforcement and Police===
Law enforcement or police chaplains work with and as part of local, regional, county, state, and national or federal law enforcement and provide a variety of services within the law enforcement community. They should not be confused with prison chaplains, whose primary ministry is to those who are incarcerated either awaiting trial or after conviction. The role of the law enforcement chaplain deals primarily with law enforcement personnel and agencies. The chaplain responds to these unique needs and challenges with religious guidance, reassuring and trustworthy presence, resources and counseling services. The law enforcement chaplain offers support to law enforcement officers, administrators, support staff, victims and their families, and occasionally even the families of accused or convicted offenders. Law enforcement chaplaincy is a ministry of presence and must have the proper training if they are working with law enforcement officers. Some ministries such as Chaplain Fellowship Ministries requires LEO chaplains to be certified in Public Safety Chaplaincy before becoming certified as a LEO chaplain. Most chaplains are uniformed and some may have a rank, they will always wear distinguishing insignia and/or markings to denote their chaplain rather than lawman status.

===Military===

{{Main article|Military chaplain}}
Military chaplains provide pastoral, spiritual and emotional support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea, on bases or in the field. Military chaplains have a long history; the first [[England|English]] military-oriented chaplains, for instance, were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the 8th century.  Land-based chaplains appeared during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the [[World War I|First World War]].

Chaplains are nominated, appointed, or commissioned in different ways in different countries. A military chaplain can be an army-trained soldier with additional [[theology|theological]] training or an ordained person nominated to the army by religious authorities. In the United Kingdom the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] employs chaplains but their authority comes from their sending church. Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week [[bespoke]] induction and training course including a short course at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain.  Naval chaplains called to service with the [[Royal Marines]] undertake a grueling five-month-long Commando Course and, if successful, wear the commandos' [[Green beret|Green Beret]].  British Army chaplains undertake seven weeks training at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre [[Amport House]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].  [[Royal Air Force]] chaplains must complete a 12-week Specialist Entrant course at the [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell|RAF College Cranwell]] followed by the Chaplains' Induction Course at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Amport House of a further two weeks. The United States Navy will often give chaplain training to cadets seeking a theological route in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaplain Training|url=http://www.navy.com/dms/navy/downloads/pdf/officer/Chaplain-Candidate-Program-Brochure.pdf|access-date=January 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124181956/http://www.navy.com/dms/navy/downloads/pdf/officer/Chaplain-Candidate-Program-Brochure.pdf#|archive-date=January 24, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, they are granted instant employment as a Navy chaplain once ordained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaplain Jobs|url=http://www.navy.com/jobs/chaplain.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the United States military, chaplains must be endorsed by their religious affiliation in order to serve in any facet of the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/chaplain/requirements.jsp|title=Requirements|website=goarmy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usafhc.af.mil/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113224027/http://www.usafhc.af.mil/ |archivedate=November 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, like that of the U.S. Navy, a Religious Program Specialist may be appointed to help alleviate some of the duties bestowed upon Naval chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Program Specialist|url=http://www.navy.com/careers/chaplain-support/religious-program-specialist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unifil catholic mass.jpg|thumb|[[French Army|French soldiers]] of the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|UNIFIL]] attending a Catholic Mass in [[Lebanon]]]]
[[File:Resnicoff BeirutKippa.jpg|thumb|Jewish chaplain Rabbi [[Arnold Resnicoff]] wears a [[kippah]]/yarmulke made from a piece of a Catholic chaplain's [[Battledress|camouflage uniform]] after his own head covering had become bloodied when it was used to wipe the face of a wounded marine during the 1983 [[Beirut barracks bombing]].]]

Military chaplains are normally accorded officer status, although [[Sierra Leone]] had a Naval Lance Corporal chaplain in 2001. In most navies, their badges and insignia do not differentiate their levels of responsibility and status. By contrast, in air forces and armies, they typically carry ranks and are differentiated by crosses or other equivalent religious insignia. However, United States military chaplains in every branch carry both rank and Chaplain Corps insignia.

Though the [[Geneva Conventions]] does not state whether chaplains may bear arms, they specify (Protocol I, June 8, 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are [[non-combatants]]. In recent times both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not medical personnel, to be unarmed.  Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, make it an issue of individual conscience.  Captured chaplains are not considered Prisoners of War (Third Convention, August 12, 1949, Chapter IV Art 33) and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.
[[File:Military chaplain.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy chaplain in [[Iraq]] studies his [[Bible]] for an upcoming service.]]

Inevitably, a significant number of serving chaplains have died in action. 100 chaplains of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] were [[killed in action]] during World War II: a casualty rate greater "than any other branch of the services except the infantry and the Army Air Corps" (Crosby, 1994, pxxiii). Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have won Britain's highest award for gallantry, the [[Victoria Cross]]). The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]] is a special [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|U.S. military decoration]] given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous [[Four Chaplains]], all of whom died in the {{SS|Dorchester||2}} sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others. In addition to these, five other U.S. chaplains have been awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]: Chaplain ([[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|LCDR]]) [[Joseph T. O'Callahan]], [[United States Navy|USN]] ([[World War II]]); Chaplain ([[Captain (United States O-3)|CPT]]) [[Emil Kapaun]], USA (Posthumous, [[Korean War]]); Chaplain ([[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]]) [[Vincent Capodanno]], USN (Posthumous, [[Vietnam War]]); Chaplain ([[Major (United States)|MAJ]]) [[Charles J. Watters]], [[United States Army|USA]] (Posthumous, Vietnam War); and Chaplain ([[Captain (United States O-3)|CPT]]) [[Angelo J. Liteky]], USA (Vietnam).  (Later in life, Liteky changed his name to Charles, left the Catholic priesthood, became an anti-war activist, and renounced his Medal of Honor). Chaplain Fellowship Ministries military chaplains are nondenominational. To be considered for appointment to serve as a military chaplain, candidates must first be ordained and have an ecclesiastical endorsement by a valid religious faith group recognized by the Department of Defense. Candidates must meet all DOD requirements. The Chaplain Fellowship had military chaplains serving in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.

In 2006, training materials obtained by U.S. intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |title=Iraqi Insurgent Snipers Target U.S. Medics, Engineers and Chaplains |publisher=Pensito Review |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |first=Jon |last=Ponder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States European Command]] has co-sponsored an annual [[International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference]] every year since 1991.

At times, the existence of military chaplains has been challenged in countries that have a [[separation of Church and State]].&lt;ref&gt;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=891776135764757633&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/orgs_ext/aumoneries/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925085650/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/orgs_ext/aumoneries/ |archivedate=September 25, 2005 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Some chaplains use live music as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.edu/news/singing-chaplain-uses-music-comfort-ailing-patients|title=Singing chaplain uses music to comfort ailing patients - Pacific School of Religion|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218145537/http://www.psr.edu/news/singing-chaplain-uses-music-comfort-ailing-patients|archivedate=December 18, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music can aid in healing, access core faith and emotions, and help to build rapport in the chaplaincy relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.professionalchaplains.org/files/publications/chaplaincy_today_online/volume_28_number_2/28_2paledofsky.pdf |format=PDf |title=Song of the Soul: The Use of Live Music in Professional Chaplaincy |author= Jesse Paledofsky |website=Chaplaincy Today, vol. 28, no. 2, Autumn/Winter 2012, pp. 31–36|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical bands (especially Christian groups) may bring a chaplain with them to conduct services while they are on tour. There can also be chaplains who minister to concert-goers at [[music festival]]s.{{cn|date= May 2018}}

===Parliamentary===

Daniel Coughlin]] in recognition for his 11 years of service as [[Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives]], April 2011]]

Some nations, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have chaplains appointed to work with parliamentary bodies, such as the [[Chaplain of the United States Senate]], the [[Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives]], and Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/supporting-the-speaker/speakers-chaplain/|title=Speaker's chaplain|website=UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to opening proceedings with prayer, these chaplains provide pastoral counseling to congressional members, their staffs, and their families;  coordinate the scheduling of guest chaplains, who offer opening prayers; arrange and sometimes conduct marriages, memorial services, and funeral services for congress, staff, and their families; and conduct or coordinate religious services, study groups, prayer meetings, holiday programs, and religious education programs, as well.

===Prison===
Prison chaplains can be a "safety valve, through listening and pro-social intervention" in potentially explosive situations.&lt;ref name="Drum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preciousheart.net/chaplaincy/Drum_Professional_Chaplain_2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=Professional Correctional Chaplains: Fact and Fiction |author= Vance L.

[[File:Rabbi Philip Alstat.jpg|thumb|[[Rabbi]] [[Philip R. Alstat]], c.1920, Jewish chaplain for "[[The Tombs]]" – the Manhattan Correctional Facility – for thirty years.]]
Rabbi [[Philip R. Alstat]] (1891–1976), who—in addition to work as a chaplain in New York hospitals and senior citizen facilities—served for three decades as the Jewish chaplain for "[[The Tombs]]", the Manhattan Detention Facility, once described his service as follows: "My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities—to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars.
Mine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fiske, ''New York Times, ''City Prison Chaplains' Load is Heavy, October 26, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first qualitative exploratory studies into prison chaplaincy was by Dr. Lindsay Carey and Dr. Laura Chahda (La Trobe University, Australia) who identified that the role of chaplains was important in helping inmates to cope during their custodial period and for those prisoners being 'discharged' back into the community. The research also identified however, that there were a number of barriers that thwarted chaplains from being efficient in helping to rehabilitate prisoners - and thus also effected the personal development of prisoners and challenged the effectiveness of government rehabilitative goals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Carey, L.

===Sports===
{{Main article|Sports chaplain}}
A sports chaplain provides pastoral care for the sports person and the broader sports community including the [[Coach (sport)|coach]], [[Academic administration|administrator]]s and their families.

Chaplains to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years. The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have well established [[Christian]] sports chaplaincy [[Christian ministry|ministries]].

Sports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but occasionally, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration. Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport. This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but also to give them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.

===Animal===
Veterinary chaplains serve people and their animals, ministering with regards to the spirituality associated with animals and their connections with humans.&lt;ref name="Hurtado"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahwatukee.com/news/article_b608ca1a-aba4-11e2-a089-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Animal chaplains teach that animals have spiritual nature|website=Ahwatukee Foothills News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major function is grief support and prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigananimalchaplain.com/services/|title=Services "  Michigan Animal Chaplain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other services include hospice support while animals are cared for near the end of their lives; support in animal health crises, including at the veterinary hospital; conducting services for animal blessings, naming/adopting ceremonies, and end of life celebration ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Hurtado"/&gt; Veterinary chaplains may also offer sermons and spiritual guidance on the human/animal bond and our responsibilities toward animals; and some may visit nursing homes and hospitals with therapeutic animal assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalchaplains.blogspot.ca/2007/07/animal-chaplains.html|title=Welcome to AnimalChaplains.com blog!|author=Animal Chaplain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other veterinary chaplains may provide blessings for animal care workers; assist with human/animal communication; and offer alternative healing for animals such as animal Reiki or acupuncture.

===Colonial===
A colonial chaplain was appointed to a [[colony]]. The term is commonly used to refer to the chaplain appointed as a non-[[military chaplain]] to one of the [[Crown Colony|Crown Colonies]] from the late 18th century or early 19th century. [[Richard Johnson (chaplain)|Richard Johnson]] (1756–1827) was the first colonial chaplain appointed to the new [[prison colony]] at [[New South Wales]] in 1786.

===Cruise===
Working on board cruise ships, cruise chaplains provide pastoral and spiritual support to both passengers and crew members. With the co-operation of cruise companies, chaplains normally stay on board for the specific duration of a cruise.

===Domestic===
&lt;!-- "Domestic chaplain" redirects here - please change redirect if changing header name --&gt;
A domestic chaplain was a chaplain attached to a [[nobility|noble]] [[household]] in order to grant the family a degree of self-sufficiency in religion. The chaplain was freed from any obligation to reside in a particular place so could travel with the family, internationally if necessary, and minister to their spiritual needs. Further, the family could appoint a chaplain who reflected their own doctrinal views. Domestic chaplains performed family christenings, funerals and weddings and were able to conduct services in the family's private chapel, excusing the nobility from attending public worship.&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;Gibson (1997) ''pp''1–6&lt;/ref&gt;

In feudal times most laymen, and for centuries even most noblemen, were poorly educated and the chaplain would also be an important source of [[scholarship]] in the household, tutoring children and providing counsel to the family on matters broader than religion.&lt;ref name="gibson"/&gt; Before the advent of the [[lawyer|legal profession]], modern [[bureaucracy]] and [[civil service]], the literate clergy were often employed as [[secretary|secretarial]] staff, as in a [[chancellor|chancery]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Hence the term ''clerk'', derived from Latin ''clericus'' (clergyman).{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} This made them very influential in temporal affairs. There was also a moral impact since they heard the confessions of the elite.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The domestic chaplain was an important part of the life of the [[peerage]] in [[England]] from the reign of [[Henry VIII]] to the middle of the 19th century. Up until 1840, [[Anglican]] domestic chaplains were regulated by [[law]] and enjoyed the substantial financial advantage of being able to purchase a [[license]] to hold two [[benefice]]s simultaneously while residing in neither.&lt;ref name="gibson"/&gt;

Many monarchies and major [[nobility|noble]] houses had, or still have, several domestic or private chaplains as part of their [[Ecclesiastical Household]], either following them or attached to a castle or other residence. Queen Elizabeth II has 36 Anglican chaplains, in addition to chaplains extraordinary and honorary chaplains appointed to minister to her. Castles with attached chaplains generally had at least one [[Chapel Royal]], sometimes as significant as a [[cathedral]]. A modern example is [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], also the home of the [[Order of the Garter]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Other===
[[File:Chaplain Office York Railway Station.JPG|thumb|Chaplain’s Office, [[York railway station]]]]

There are also chaplains to private clubs, television or radio stations, family, community teams, groups such as [[Boys Brigade|Boys]] and [[Girls Brigade]] companies and [[Scouting|Scout]] troops, airports, cruise ships, nightclubs, the internet including Facebook (see "Internet Chapel" in Facebook) and theaters.

The term can also refer to priests attached to [[Roman Catholic]] [[convent]]s. There is also the position of [[Chaplain of His Holiness]], a title granted by the Pope to certain priests who become part of the Papal Household and work with the Papal Chapel. Prior to 1968 they were called Supernumerary Privy Chamberlains.

The '''Church of Cognizance''' ('''COC''') was founded in 1991 by Danuel &amp; Mary Quaintance&lt;ref&gt;[http://danmary.org dan&amp;mary's Monastery-HEMPorium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530103628/http://danmary.org/ |date=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Graham County (Pima) [[Arizona]], [[United States]].

==Beginnings==
In 1994, the Quaintances recorded a 16-page "Declaration of Religious Sentiment" concretizing the establishment of their church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/coc-recording.pdf ''Coc-declaration'']&lt;/ref&gt; The COC Founders recording announced their intent to unite the world's ethnic minorities that utilize and rely upon the [[cannabis]] hemp plant as an ethno-socio-religious institution following Neo-Zoroastrian tenets.

While COC members are encouraged to study all of the world's religions, the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]] is held by them to be the least convoluted and most ancient source supporting their practices and beliefs. Numerous references to [[Haoma]] may be found in the Avesta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/y9to11s.PDF ''Translated Avesta Yasna 9-11'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the COC with 40 to 50 members in Arizona, nationwide had 72 registered Individual Orthodox Member Monasteries (IOMMs), which are located inside members' homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070216222414/http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/137087.php ''(Archived) Arizona Daily Star - Pot church takes a hit '']&lt;/ref&gt;

==COC Membership==
To become a "registered member" of the COC, a candidate must read a pamphlet titled "The Church Of Cognizance Introduced".&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/pledge.pdf ''The Church Of Cognizance Introduced'']&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet includes the below stated beliefs, description of organization, and the membership pledge of the church. If the candidate is in agreement with the beliefs, organization, and pledge, they then must then fill out, and sign their PLEDGE and return it to the designated address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iomm.info ''(Official) COC Membership page''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605230913/http://iomm.info/ |date=2013-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Members of the COC claim to believe:

1. That [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as [[Haoma]], when raised and used properly, aids the mind, body, and soul.

2. That Haoma is the ancient teacher of wisdom, compassion, and the way to the kingdom of glory in heaven on earth, while humans let ego block their own, and others, path to this kingdom of glory.

3. That Haoma is the capable provider of all substance required to accommodate a comfortable, healthy, productive, full-bearing life.

4. That Haoma is the righteous Protector of their health, and longevity; by way of receptors in the human body that believe Haoma connects with to heal.

Based on their beliefs, they declare Marijuana/Cannabis/Haoma to be "the teacher, the protector, the provider". And further, that the proper religious use promotes "Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds, none of which is harmful to the health, safety, welfare, or morals of society in general".

===Organization===
The COC is composed of "Family Oriented Monastic Orders" wherein members are dedicated to promoting the health, safety, welfare, culture, and tradition of the family thru their belief:

1. That the physically able, retired adults, of the family should care for the sick, the eldest, and the youngest of the family.

:      a. The eldest of the family whom have provided in the past should not be forgotten and tossed aside for strangers to care for.

:      b. The children of the family need to learn the family’s culture and traditions from a member of the family with that wisdom.

:      c. It allows the able bodied of the family to work and provide for the entire family without the worry of who's caring for their offspring, and whose customs and traditions they are taught.

:      d. It keeps family together, helping family, and the family as a whole may become Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise.

Each Family Oriented Monastic Order of the Church Of Cognizance is designated an "Individual Orthodox Member Monastery" (IOMM).

===Members Pledge===
By submitting their application, prospective members pledge their allegiance, and support, to the Church Of Cognizance and the IOMMs of which it is composed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/coc_pledge.pdf ''Members Pledge'']&lt;/ref&gt; Their pledge requires:

:       a. That they will do their best to live an honorable life; in a family oriented mode; as described in The Church Of Cognizance Belief’s Introduced.

:       b. That they will not allow any Marijuana raised for religious use to enter into commerce, nor will they provide marijuana to anyone outside of the Church Of Cognizance; other than in providing for the religious use by a potential member; and, that use must be under their direct supervision.

:       c. They agree that until such time as the governments end their war against the sacrament of the COC, they will keep any cultivation, or use, confined to a secluded, secure area, in order to mitigate government fears regarding child endangerment.

:       d. They understand that it is a duty of theirs to share the bounty of any harvest with the sick, and dying free of charge; when requested, if they are aware, or made aware, of it being beneficial in such situations.

:       e. And last, that they will respect other family’s lifestyles by agreeing not to introduce any minors into the Marijuana Religion.

==Founders' arrest, prosecution and sentencing==

On February 22, 2006, the founders of the Church of Cognizance, Danuel and Mary Quaintance, were arrested with 172 pounds of marijuana. They asserted that the marijuana was for religious use, an argument which US District court judge Judith C. Herrera rejected outright. The federal judge stated that the evidence shows the two created the church and beliefs as a way of justifying their lifestyle choice to use marijuana and their belief that marijuana should be legalized.  She further stated they cannot avoid prosecution for illegal conduct by simply calling their conduct a religion.  Also it was noted that the monasteries were all located in members' homes.  The church states a "declaration of religious sentiment" on behalf of the Church of Cognizance was filed with the Graham County Recorder's Office 12 years prior this arrest in 1994. Further noted was that the Quaintances had not faced any prior criminal charges related to their church and that they do not grow marijuana but pick it up from church "couriers", which is what they were doing when they were arrested.  Both founders stepped down as leaders of the church following their arrests. But the couple hope to one day resume what they view as their worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azstarnet.com/lifestyles/faith-and-values/court-overrules-church-s-use-of-pot-as-sacrament/article_55458b9c-880d-5aaf-a4cf-5c424612aa3e.html ''Arizona Daily Star - Court overrules church's use of pot as sacrament '']&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2008, they both pleaded guilty to two counts. One count of conspiracy with intent to distribute 200 pounds or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana; and one count of possession with the intent to distribute 100 pounds or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana, as well as aiding and abetting.  They faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Danuel Quaintance is serving{{When|date=November 2017}} a five-year sentence at a facility at the Federal Correctional Institute in Terminal Island, California, near Long Beach. Mary Quaintance is serving two years at the Victorville Federal Correctional Complex in Adelanto, Calif.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpho.com/news/20943492/detail.html "Pot Church Copes With Jailed Leaders"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614055400/http://www.kpho.com/news/20943492/detail.html |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they both were confident that an appeal based on their claimed religious use would keep them out of prison,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/faith/256138 "Arizona Daily Star - Pot-deifying duo guilty, confident they'll avoid prison"]&lt;/ref&gt; a unanimous three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on May 19, 2010, affirmed the denial of the couple’s RFRA defense in ''United States v. Quaintance''. The panel agreed that evidence in the case established that the Quaintances had failed to establish that their beliefs about marijuana as a sacred substance were sincerely held, further concluding that “the record contains … overwhelming evidence that the Quaintances were running a commercial marijuana business with a religious front — particularly in this transaction aimed at securing bail money for Ms. Quaintance’s brother.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100713031740/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=22979 ''Church founders can't escape drug charges  '']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">'''Clinical pastoral education''' (CPE) is [[education]] to teach [[pastoral care]] to [[clergy]] and others. CPE is the primary method of training hospital and hospice [[chaplains]] and spiritual care providers in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt; Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; CPE is both a [[multicultural]] and [[interfaith]] experience that uses real-life ministry encounters of students to improve the ministry and pastoral care provided by caregivers.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm |title =Frequently Asked Questions about ACPE Clinical Pastoral Education |work =The Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, Inc |at = See section [http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm#faq1 What is Clinical Pastoral Education?] |accessdate = 2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Theory==
An underpinning theory of education that structures clinical pastoral education is the "[[Reflective Practice|Action-Reflection]]" mode of learning. CPE students typically compose "verbatims" of their pastoral care encounters in which they are invited to reflect upon what occurred and draw insight from these reflections that can be implemented in future pastoral care events.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the practice of pastoral care has a long tradition in Christianity and to some extent in other faith traditions, the systematic analysis of pastoral practice associated with clinical pastoral education had its beginnings in the early 20th century. In 1925, [[Richard Clarke Cabot|Richard Cabot]], a physician and adjunct lecturer at the [[Harvard Divinity School]], published an article in ''[[Survey Graphic]]'' suggesting that every candidate for ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stokoe |first=Rodney J.R. |year=2005 |origyear=1974 |title=Clinical Pastoral Education |type=Reprint |journal=The Nova Scotia Medical Bulletin |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=26–28 |issn=0029-5094 |url=http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-20 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171141/http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }} The reprint is available as part of the project: {{cite web |url=http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |title=Living Human Memories |work=CASC/ACSS The Canadian Association for Spiritual Care |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622230836/http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the Rev. [[Anton Boisen]] placed theological students at the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] in supervised contact with patients in mental hospitals, a flagship program that later resulted in the forming of the ACPE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403034355/http://www.aapc.org/content/brief-history-pastoral-counseling American Association of Pastoral Counselors/History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accrediting bodies==

CPE in Australia and New Zealand is conducted by six CPE accrediting associations that consult together for common curricula and standards of practice under an umbrella association, the Australia New Zealand Association of Clinical Pastoral Education (ANZACPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspea.org.au/anzacpe.php&lt;/ref&gt; The six constituent associations are: [[New South Wales College of Clinical Pastoral Education]] (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory); Queensland Institute of Clinical Pastoral Education; Association for Supervised Pastoral Education in Australia (Victoria and Tasmania); Association for Clinical Pastoral Education in Western Australia; South Australia and Northern Territory Association for Clinical Pastoral Education; and New Zealand Association for Clinical Pastoral Education.

In the United States, the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education is recognized as an [[education accreditation|accrediting]] organization for CPE programs by the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html|title =Specialized Accrediting Agencies| publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate = 2013-07-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, all CPE training and accreditation is done through [http://www.spiritualcare.ca/ CASC], the Canadian Association of Spiritual Care / Association Canadienne de Soins Spirituels.

The '''Edict of Milan''' ({{lang-la|Edictum Mediolanense}}) was the February 313 AD agreement to treat Christians benevolently within the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Frend"&gt;Frend, W. H. C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Western Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], who controlled the Balkans, met in [[Milan]] and, among other things, agreed to change policies towards Christians&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt; following the [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] issued two years earlier in [[Serdica]]. The Edict of Milan gave Christianity a legal status, but did not make Christianity the [[State church of the Roman Empire]]; this took place under Emperor [[Theodosius I]] in 380 AD with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]].

The document is found in [[Lactantius]]' ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' and in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s [[Church History (Eusebius)|''History of the Church'']] with marked divergences between the two.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"&gt;Cross and Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' 1974 art. '''Milan, Edict of.'''&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not there was a formal 'Edict of Milan'&amp;thinsp; is debated by some.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

The version found in Lactantius is not in the form of an edict.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"/&gt; It is a letter from Licinius to the governors of the provinces in the Eastern Empire he had just conquered by defeating [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]]&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; later in the same year and issued in Nicomedia.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:ImperialpalaceMilan.jpg|thumb|300 px|Remains of the Imperial palace of Mediolanum (Milan). The imperial palace (built in large part by [[Maximian]], colleague of [[Diocletian]]) was a large complex with several buildings, gardens, and courtyards, used for the Emperor's private and public activities, and for his court, family, and imperial bureaucracy.]]
Ever since the fall of the [[Severan dynasty]] in 235 AD, rivals for the imperial throne had bid for support by either favouring or [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecuting Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Frend, W.H.C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The previous [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] had been recently issued by the emperor [[Galerius]] from [[Serdica]] and was posted at [[Nicomedia]] on 30 April 311. By its provisions, the Christians, who had "followed such a caprice and had fallen into such a folly that they would not obey the institutes of antiquity", were granted an indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Wherefore, for this our indulgence, they ought to pray to their God for our safety, for that of the republic, and for their own, that the commonwealth may continue uninjured on every side, and that they may be able to live securely in their homes.}}

Their confiscated property, however, was not restored until 313, when instructions were given for the Christians' meeting places and other properties to be returned and compensation paid by the state to the current owners:&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Ecclesiastical History'' 5.15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.}}

It directed the provincial magistrates to execute this order at once with all energy so that public order may be restored and the continuance of divine favour may "preserve and prosper our successes together with the good of the state."

The actual letters have never been retrieved. However, they are quoted at length in [[Lactantius]]' ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors'' (''De mortibus persecutorum''), which gives the Latin text of both Galerius's Edict of Toleration as posted at Nicomedia on 30 April 311 and of Licinius's letter of toleration and restitution addressed to the governor of Bithynia and posted at Nicomedia on 13 June 313.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'' 34.1–35.1, 48.1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eusebius]] of Caesarea translated both documents into Greek in his ''History of the Church'' (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''). His version of the letter of Licinius must derive from a copy posted in the province of [[Palaestina Prima]] (probably at its capital, [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|Caesarea]]) in the late summer or early autumn of 313, but the origin of his copy of Galerius's Edict of 311 is unknown since that does not seem to have been promulgated in Caesarea. In his description of the events in Milan in his ''[[Life of Constantine]]'', Eusebius eliminated the role of Licinius, whom he portrayed as the evil foil to his hero Constantine.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Edict was in effect directed against [[Maximinus Daia]], the Caesar in the East who was at that time styling himself as Augustus. Having received the emperor Galerius' instruction to repeal the persecution in 311, Maximinus had instructed his subordinates to desist, but had not released Christians from prisons or virtual death-sentences in the mines, as Constantine and Licinius had both done in the West.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"&gt;Inscription printed in Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Galerius' death, Maximin was no longer constrained; he enthusiastically took up renewed persecutions in the eastern territories under his control, encouraging petitions against Christians. One of those petitions, addressed not only to Maximin but also to Constantine and Licinius, is preserved in a stone inscription at Arycanda in Lycia, and is a "request that the Christians, who have long been disloyal and still persist in the same mischievous intent, should at last be put down and not be suffered by any absurd novelty to offend against the honour due to the gods."&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"/&gt;

The Edict is popularly thought to concern only Christianity, and even to make Christianity the official religion of the Empire (which recognition did not actually occur until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380). Indeed, the Edict expressly grants religious liberty not only to Christians, who had been the object of special persecution, but goes even further and grants liberty to all religions:

{{quote|text=When you see that this has been granted to [Christians] by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship for the sake of the peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity of any religion.|sign="Edict of Milan"|source=Lactantius, ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors (De Mortibus Persecutorum)'', ch. 48. opera, ed. 0. F. Fritzsche, II, p 288 sq. (''Bibl Patr. Ecc. Lat.'' XI).&lt;ref&gt;And similarly in [http://wadsworth.com/history_d/special_features/ilrn_legacy/wawc1c01c/content/wciv1/readings/eusebius.html Eusebius].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since Licinius composed the Edict with the intent of publishing it in the east{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} upon his hoped-for victory over Maximinus, it expresses the religious policy accepted by Licinius, a pagan, rather than that of Constantine{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}, who was already a Christian. Constantine's own policy went beyond merely tolerating Christianity: he tolerated paganism and other religions, but he actively promoted Christianity.

==Religious statement==
Although the Edict of Milan is commonly presented as Constantine’s first great act as a Christian emperor, it is disputed whether the Edict of Milan was an act of genuine faith. The document could be seen as Constantine's first step in creating an alliance with the Christian God, who he considered the strongest deity.&lt;ref&gt;Sordi, Marta. ''The Christians and the Roman Empire.'' Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994. p134.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, he was concerned about social stability and the protection of the empire from the wrath of the Christian God: in this view, the Edict could be a pragmatic political decision rather than a religious shift. However, the majority of historians believe that Constantine's conversion to Christianity was genuine, and that the Edict of Milan was merely the first official act of Constantine as a dedicated Christian. This view is supported by Constantine's ongoing favors on behalf of Christianity during the rest of his reign. &lt;ref&gt;Maier, Paul L. ''Eusebius: The Church History''. Grand Rapids: Kegel Publications, 1999. p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Edict of Milan required that the wrong done to the Christians be righted as thoroughly as possible; it claims “it has pleased us to remove all conditions whatsoever.”&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"&gt;"Paul Halsall, “Galerius and Constantine: Edicts of Toleration 311/313,” Fordham University; [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/edict-milan.asp Fordham.edu]; Internet, accessed 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The edict further demanded that individual Romans right any wrongs towards Christians, claiming that “the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.” These provisions indicate that more than just the establishment of justice was intended. After demanding the immediate return of what was lost by the Christians, the edict states that this should be done so that “public order may be secured”, not for the intrinsic value of justice or the glory of God.&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt; The exhortation to urgently right wrongs reflects the leaders' desires to avoid unfavorable consequences, which in this case included social unrest and further conquests. Constantine was superstitious and believed enough in the existence of the non-Christian gods to not want to offset the balance of good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yuri Koszarycz |title=Constantinian Christianity |publisher=The Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies |url=http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |website=The-orb.net |access-date=14 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215120014/http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |archivedate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that, the sooner this balance was restored by the Romans establishing a state of justice with the Christians, the sooner the state would become stable.

'''Fear of God''' refers to [[fear]] or a specific sense of respect, awe, and submission to a [[deity]]. People subscribing to popular [[monotheistic religions]] might fear [[divine judgment]], [[hell]] or God's [[omnipotence]].

==Bahá'í==
In the Bahá'í Faith, "The heart must be sanctified from every form of selfishness and lust, for the weapons of the unitarians and the saints were and are the fear of God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/compilation_fear_god "Fear of God", Bahá'í Library Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
According to [[Pope Francis]], “The fear of the Lord, the gift of the Holy Spirit, doesn’t mean being afraid of God, since we know that God is our Father that always loves and forgives us,...[It] is no servile fear, but rather a joyful awareness of God’s grandeur and a grateful realization that only in him do our hearts find true peace.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-fear-of-the-lord-an-alarm-reminding-us-of-whats-right-48609 Harris, Elise. "Pope: Fear of the Lord an alarm reminding us of what's right", Catholic News Agency, June 11, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

From a theological perspective "fear of the Lord" encompasses more than simple fear. Robert B. Strimple says, "There is the convergence of awe, reverence, adoration, honor, worship, confidence, thankfulness, love, and, yes, fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opc.org/new_horizons/NH01/03a.html|title=The Fear of the Lord|publisher=Opc.org|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Magnificat]] (Luke 1:50) Mary declaims, "His mercy is from age to age to those who fear him." The [[Parable of the Unjust Judge]] (Luke 18:1-8) finds Jesus describing the judge as one who "...neither feared God nor cared for man." Some translations of the [[Bible]], such as the [[New International Version]], sometimes replace the word "fear" with "reverence".

It can also mean fear of [[Divine judgment|God's judgment]]. The fear of God is felt because one understands the "fearful expectation of judgement". Still, this is not a fear that leads one to despair, rather it must be coupled with trust, and most importantly, love. In {{Bibleref2|Psalms|130:3-4}}, it is said, "If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? But  with you there is forgiveness; therefore you are feared."

In the [[New Testament]], this fear is described using the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word φόβος (''[[Phobos (mythology)|phobos]]'', "fear/horror"), except in [[First Epistle to Timothy|1 Timothy]] 2:10, where [[Saint Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] describes γυναιξὶν ἐπαγγελλομέναις θεοσέβειαν (''gynaixin epangellomenais theosebeian''), "women professing the fear of God", using the word θεοσέβεια (''theosebeia'').

Roman Catholicism counts this fear as one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. In {{Bibleref2|Proverbs|15:33}}, the fear of the Lord is described as the "discipline" or "instruction" of wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[New Revised Standard Version]]'' translates the Hebrew as ''instruction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[Jacques Forget]] explains that this gift "fills us with a sovereign respect for God, and makes us dread, above all things, to offend Him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm Forget, Jacques. "Holy Ghost." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 3 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 2006 article published in ''Inside the Vatican'' magazine, contributing editor John Mallon writes that the "fear" in "fear of the Lord" is often misinterpreted as "servile fear" (the fear of getting in trouble) when it should be understood as "filial fear" (the fear of offending someone whom one loves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

According to [[Jerry Bridges]], "There was a time when committed Christians were known as God-fearing people. This was a badge of honor."&lt;ref&gt;Bridges, Jerry. ''The Joy of Fearing God'', p.1, WaterBrook Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutheran theologian [[Rudolf Otto]] coined the term [[numinous]] to express the type of fear one has for the Lord. Anglican [[C. S. Lewis]] references the term in many of his writings, but specifically describes it in his book ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'' and states that fear of the numinous is not a fear that one feels for a tiger, or even a ghost. Rather, the fear of the numinous, as C. S. Lewis describes it, is one filled with awe, in which you "feel wonder and a certain shrinking" or "a sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant of or prostration before it". It is a fear that comes forth out of love for the Lord.

==Islam==
''[[Taqwa]]'' is an Islamic term for being conscious and cognizant of God, of truth, of the rational reality, "[[piety]], fear of [[God in Islam|God]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/tak-wa-COM_1457?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=takwa "Taḳwā"],''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nanji, Azim. "Islamic Ethics," in ''A Companion to Ethics'', Peter Singer. Oxford: Blackwells,n(1991), pp. 106&amp;ndash;118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often found in the Quran. ''Al-Muttaqin'' ({{lang-ar|لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Al-Muttaqin}}'') refers to those who practice ''taqwa'',  or in the words of [[Ibn Abbas]] -- "believers who avoid [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]] with Allah and who work in His obedience."&lt;ref name=Al-Muttaqin&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Al-Muttaqin|url=http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=453&amp;Itemid=36|website=Quran Tafsir Ibn Kathir|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{see also|Devekut#Forms of love and fear of God}}
The first mention of the ''fear of God'' in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is in Genesis 22:12, where [[Abraham]] is commended for putting his trust in God. In Isaiah 11:1-3, the prophet describes the shoot that shall sprout from the stump of Jesse, "The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him: a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, A spirit of counsel and of strength, a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord, and his delight shall be the fear of the Lord." Proverbs 9:10 says that "fear of the Lord" is "the beginning of wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version]]'' translates the Hebrew as ''discipline''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] words יִרְאַ֣ת (''yir’aṯ'') and יִרְאַ֣ת (''p̄aḥaḏ'') {{huh|tyese are the same Hebrew|date=September 2018}} are most commonly used to describe fear of God/[[El (deity)|El]]/[[Yahweh]].

[[Bahya ibn Paquda]] characterized two types of fear as a lower "fear of punishment" and a higher "fear of [divine awe] glory." [[Abraham ibn Daud]] differentiated between "fear of harm" (analogous to fear of a snake bite or a king's punishment) and "fear of greatness," analogous to respect for an exalted person, who would do us no harm. Maimonides categorized the fear of God as a positive commandment, as the feeling of human insignificance deriving from contemplation of God's "great and wonderful actions and creations."

'''''In Search of Noah's Ark''''' is a 1976 [[documentary film]] released by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]] that explores the alleged final resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].

==Production notes==
''In Search of Noah's Ark'' was produced by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]], a [[Utah]]-based [[independent film]] company that specialized in releasing [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] family films and documentaries. Along with such features as ''[[Beyond and Back]]'' (1978) and ''[[In Search of Historic Jesus]]'' (1979), the film was one of a series of releases from the company that attempted to present convincing scientific evidence for [[Christian theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.amctv.com/movie/1978/Beyond+and+Back ''Beyond and Back'', AMC Movie Guide.] [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]. Retrieved July 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the film were shot in [[Park City, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was based on the book by David Balsiger. Filmed independently and inexpensively, the documentary makes the assertion that Noah's Ark, from the [[Genesis flood narrative|biblical flood narrative]], has been found on [[Mountains of Ararat|the slopes]] of [[Mount Ararat]] in [[Turkey]], though physical and political difficulties prevent a more extensive study of the alleged vessel. The movie included a dramatic re-enactment of Noah's story as one of its highlights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/review/in-search-of-noahs-ark/ ''In Search of Noah's Ark'' at Christian Film Database.] [[Christian Film Database|CFDb]].

'''Inclusivism''', one of several approaches to understanding the relationship between [[religion]]s, asserts that while one set of [[belief]]s is absolutely [[truth|true]], other sets of beliefs are at least partially true.  It stands in contrast to [[chosen people|exclusivism]], which asserts that only one way is true and all others are in error. It is a particular form of [[religious pluralism]], though that term may also assert that all beliefs are equally valid within a believer's particular context.

Broadly speaking, there are two schools of Inclusivist thought:
* Traditional Inclusivism, which asserts that the believer's own views are absolutely true, and believers of other religions are correct insofar as they agree with that believer.
* Relativistic Inclusivism, which asserts that an unknown set of assertions are Absolutely True, that no human being currently living has yet ascertained Absolute Truth, but that all human beings have partially ascertained Absolute Truth.

Strands of both types of Inclusivist thought run through all faiths.

==Ancient Greece==
[[Interpretatio graeca]] the common tendency of ancient Greek writers to equate foreign divinities to members of their own pantheon. [[Herodotus]], for example, refers to the ancient Egyptian gods Amon, Osiris and Ptah as "Zeus," "Dionysus" and "Hephaestus." This could be seen an example of inclusivism, as could syncretism.

[[Syncretism]] functionized as an essential feature of Ancient Greek religion. Later on, [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]], a consequence of Alexander the Great's belief that he was the son of a god, only to be reinforced upon personally consulting the [[Oracle of Zeus-Ammon]] at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in Egypt, itself showed syncretist features, essentially blending Persian, Anatolian, Egyptian (and eventually Etruscan-Roman) elements within Hellenic formulations. After the [[Hellenization]] of the Egyptian culture initiated by [[Ptolemy I Soter]], [[Isis#Greco-Roman_world|Isis]] became known as "[[Queen of Heaven]]" and worshipped in many aspects and by many names besides that of [[Hera]].

==Christianity==
*[[Jesus]] said, "for whoever is not against us is for us." (NIV) [[Gospel of Mark]] 9:40.
* The Apostle Peter wrote of God: "He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance." [[2 Peter]] 3:9 ([[NIV]])
* "That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world."  [[Gospel of John|John]] 1:9  Similarly Titus 2:11 says, "The grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men."
* God loved the entire world and Jesus came to save it, not condemn it ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16, 17.)
* An [[aphorism]] common in some Christian circles: "All Truth is God's Truth." Compare: "If there is something more excellent than the truth, then that is God; if not, then truth itself is God" - [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]
* Some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] scholars believe that God judges all people based on their response to the Holy Spirit, and that just as [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 2:14-15 shows that God is righteous by condemning people who violate natural law as they understand it, it also shows His mercy in forgiving those who have lived up to all the light they have had.  Thus, it is possible for people to be saved through hearing the Gospel message of forgiveness of sins by Christ, even if they have not been instructed by Christian [[missionaries]].
* [[Psalms|Psalm]] 19 presents general revelation, as exemplified by the sky and sun, in parallel with conversion.  Verses 1-6 show the transcending of the barriers of language and geography.  Verses 7-8 declare that the internalizing of the perfect law of the LORD can be efficacious in "converting the soul…making wise the simple…rejoicing the heart…enlightening the eyes."
* Melchizedek ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18), [[Balaam]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]) and the Wise Men ([[Matthew 2:1]]-[[Matthew 2:13|13]]) are examples of people who believed in God even though they were not part of the covenant people.
* Cornelius already believed in God before Peter came and preached to him ([[Acts]] 10:1-48.) "Then Peter opened his mouth and said: 'In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality, But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him."  [[Acts]] 10:34-35
* The parable of the sheep and the goats ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:31-46) portrays the judgment of the nations as being based on each individual's compassion on others, not on their religious background.  The blessings pronounced upon the poor in spirit, the meek, the merciful, the peacemakers, those hungering for righteousness, etc. ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:3-10) can also be understood as applying without reference to religion. Similarly, [[Epistle of James|James]] 1:27 says, "Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world."
* Paul said that the Greeks had been worshiping God without knowing it.  He said that in their semi-enlightened condition, they might grope for God and find Him, since He was not far from each one of us. Their own poets had declared that they were God's offspring. This shows that He was somewhat known to them.  [[Acts]] 17:23-28
* Jesus, speaking to a Samaritan woman in ([[Gospel of John|John]] 4:22), said, "You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews," implying, inclusivists believe, that it is possible to worship the true God without explicitly knowing it. Later, when an expositor of the Jewish laws asked him, “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?,” Jesus told the story of the good Samaritan and said, “Go and do likewise.”  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 10:25-37
* And he said, "Therefore, as through one man's offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man's righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life." [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 5:18
* Supporters of inclusivism include Saint [[Julian of Norwich]], [[Augustus Hopkins Strong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Strong | first=Anthony H. | date=1907 | orig-year=1886 | title=Systematic Theology | location=Old Tappan, NJ | publisher=Revell | pages=842–843 | oclc=878559610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Mere Christianity'' (New York: Macmillan, 1967), 65. For a study of Lewis on this topic see John Sanders, ''No Other Name: An Investigation into the Destiny of the Unevangelized'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1992), 251-257.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wesley]],&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, "On Faith" in ''The Works of John Wesley'', third edition volume 7 (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 1986), 197. For other texts by Wesley on the topic see John Sanders,''No Other Name: An Investigation into the Destiny of the Unevangelized'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1992),249-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clark Pinnock]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark Pinnock, ''A Wideness in God's Mercy: The Finality of Jesus Christ in a World of Religions'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]], [[John E. Sanders]], Terrance L. Tiessen ([[Reformed]]) and Robert Brush (contributor to ''The [[Arminian]] Magazine'').  While [[Billy Graham]] faithfully preached "salvation by faith in [[Christ]] alone" throughout his 60-year ministry as an [[Evangelism|evangelist]], he has recently made controversial comments that border on inclusivism (but he does not like to refer to it by the term, because he is concerned that many people mean [[Christian universalism|universalism]] when they refer to inclusivism). Graham has said, “I used to play God but I can’t do that any more.  I used to believe that pagans in far-off countries were lost and were going to hell—if they did not have the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to them.  I no longer believe that,” he said carefully.  “I believe that there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God—through nature, for instance—and plenty of other opportunities, therefore, of saying ’yes’ to God.”&lt;ref&gt;"I Can't Play God Anymore" interview with James M. Beam, ''McCall's Magazine'', (January 1978), pp. 154-158&lt;/ref&gt;
* The doctrine of inclusivism is held by Roman Catholics &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html Nostra Aetate Article 2]&lt;/ref&gt; and Seventh-day Adventists, asserting that while Christianity is the one true faith, other faiths are at least partially true, and therefore are valid ways of reaching salvation until the Gospels can be preached to them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

A standard passage cited in the debate over this question is found in Jesus' words in John 14:6: "No one comes to the Father except through me" (NIV). If this is taken to mean that a person is saved only by conscious faith in Jesus, the verse appears to contradict Lewis' position. However, another reading is that Jesus is solely responsible for making salvation possible (i.e. he "instituted" it by his death and resurrection). In this reading there may be room for the position that some might come to the Father through this salvation not knowing (at least originally) its connection to Jesus.

==Judaism==
*The Talmud states: "The righteous of all peoples have a place in the World-To-Come" (Tos. to Sanhedrin 13:2, Sifra to Leviticus 19:18), and affirms that the great majority of non-Jewish humanity will be saved, due to God's overwhelming mercy (BT Sanhedrin 105a).
*The [[Torah]] mentions a number of righteous gentiles, including [[Melchizedek]] who presided at offerings to God that [[Abraham]] made (Gen. 14:18), [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] of the [[land of Uz]] who had a whole book of the Hebrew Bible devoted to him as a paragon of righteousness beloved of God (see the [[Book of Job]]), and the Ninevites, the people given to cruelty and idolatry could be accepted by God when they repented (see the [[Book of Jonah]]).
*Rabbinic tradition asserts that the basic standard of righteousness was established in a covenant with [[Noah]]: anyone who keeps the [[seven laws of Noah]] is assured of salvation, no matter what their religion.  This is standard Jewish teaching for the past two thousand years.

== Islam ==

*The [[Qur'an]], revealed through [[Muhammad]], states, "Indeed, those who believe and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans  - those  who believe in Allah and the Last Day and do righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve." (Qur'an, Surat al-Baqara; 2:62)
*Say, 'People of the Book! come to a proposition which is the same for us and you - that we should [[worship]] none but Allah and not associate any partners with Him and not take one another as lords besides Allah.' If they turn away, say, 'Bear witness that we are Muslims.'(Surah Al 'Imran; 3:64)
*Today all good things have been made [[halal]] for you. And the food of those given the Book is also halal for you and your food is halal for them. So are chaste women from among the [[muminun]] and chaste women of those given the Book before you, once you have given them their [[dowry|dowries]] in [[marriage]], not in fornication or taking them as lovers. But as for anyone who rejects [[Iman (concept)|iman]], his actions will come to nothing and in the [[akhira]] he will be among the losers. (Surat al-Ma'ida: 5:5)
*Among the people of the Book there are some who have iman in Allah and in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down to them, and who are humble before Allah. They do not sell Allah's Signs for a paltry price. Such people will have their reward with their Lord. And Allah is swift at reckoning. (Surah Al 'Imran; 3:199)
*Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair admonition, and argue with them in the kindest way. Your Lord knows best who is misguided from His way. And He knows best who are guided. (Surat an-Nahl; 16:125)
*...You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allah ; and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, "We are Christians." That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant.. (Surat al-Ma'ida; 5:82)
*Only argue with the People of the Book in the kindest way - except in the case of those of them who do wrong - saying, 'We have iman in what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to you. Our God and your God are one and we submit to Him.'(Surat al-'Ankabut; 29:46)
*...They are not [all] the same; among the People of the Scripture is a community standing [in obedience], reciting the verses of Allah during periods of the night and prostrating [in prayer]. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds. And those are among the righteous. And whatever good they do - never will it be removed from them. And Allah is Knowing of the righteous.. (Surah Al 'Imran: 3:113-115)

==Hinduism==
*A well-known [[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]] hymn stemming from [[Hinduism]] claims that "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously.", thus proclaiming a [[Religious pluralism|pluralistic]] view of religion.
*[[Krishna]], incarnation or [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], the supreme God in Hinduism, said in the [[Gita]]: In whatever way men identify with Me, in the same way do I carry out their desires; men pursue My path, O Arjuna, in all ways. (Gita:4:11);
*Krishna said: "Whatever deity or form a devotee worships, I make his faith steady. However, their wishes are only granted by Me." (Gita: 7:21-22)
*Another quote in the Gita states: "O Arjuna, even those devotees who worship other lesser deities (e.g., [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], for example) with faith, they also worship Me, but in an improper way because I am the Supreme Being. I alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services (Seva, Yajna) and Lord of the universe." (Gita: 9:23)

==Bahá'í Faith==
*[[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in the first half of the 20th century, states: "The fundamental principle enunciated by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the followers of His Faith firmly believe, is that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process, that all the great religions of the world are divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they differ only in the nonessential aspects of their doctrines, and that their missions represent successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society." &lt;ref&gt;(The Faith of Bahá'u'lláh" in World Order, Vol. 7, No. 2 (1972–73))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bic-un.bahai.org/47-0701.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4452">'''Infallibilism''', in [[epistemology]], is the idea that propositional [[knowledge]] is incompatible with a chance of being wrong, where this is typically understood as one's evidence or justification providing one's [[belief]] with such strong grounds that it must be [[truth|true]] and perhaps cannot be rationally doubted. Other beliefs may be rationally [[Theory of justification|justified]], but they do not rise to the level of ''knowledge'' unless absolutely certain given one's evidence. Infallibilism's opposite, [[fallibilism]], is the position that a justified true belief may be considered knowledge, even if one's evidence does not guarantee its truth, or can, given one's evidence, rationally doubt it. 

Fallibilism is not to be confused with [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], which is the belief that knowledge is unattainable for rational human beings. [[René Descartes]], an early proponent of infallibilism argued, “my reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly false”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Meditations on First Philosophy|last = Descartes|first = Rene|publisher = |year = 1641|isbn = 978-0-415-07707-1|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infallibilism can be expressed in logic as "if I know that p, then I can't be mistaken about p".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Descartes/DescartesInfallibilismCartesiancircle.pdf|title = Infallibilism and the Cartesian circle|last = Lacewing|first = Michael|date = 2013|journal = A Level Philosophy|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fallibilism is endorsed by most contemporary epistemologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://courses.washington.edu/dbt560/Fallibilism.pdf|title = How to Think about Fallibilism|date = 7 June 2001|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = University of Washington Course Server|publisher = |last = Reed|first = Baron}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many in epistemology have recently presented significant arguments against fallibilism, and for infalliblism.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Mark Kaplan, "If you know you can't be wrong," in {{cite book |last1=Hetherington |first1=Stephen |title=Epistemology Futures |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=180-198 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KAPIYK}}; see also {{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-010-9815-2|title = Warrant does entail truth|last = Moon|first = Andrew|date = 2012|journal = Synthese|doi = 10.1007/s11229-010-9815-2|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015|volume=184|pages=287–297}}; {{cite journal |last1=Dutant |first1=Julien |title=How to Be an Infallibilist |journal=Philosophical Issues |date=2016 |volume=26 |pages=148-171 |doi=10.1111/phis.12085 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phis.12085}}; and {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Knowledge, Hope, and Fallibilism |journal=Synthese |date=2018 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1007/s11229-018-1794-8 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-018-1794-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion]], infallibilism is the belief that certain texts or persons are incapable of being in the wrong. The most famous example of this is probably the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrine of [[papal infallibility]], under which the [[Pope]] is considered infallible in certain matters of doctrine, when his decisions are promulgated ''[[ex cathedra]]''. Since 1870, the Catholic Church has officially declared that its earthly head, the Pope, in certain circumstances, is so grounded in the mission of the church that he teaches "infallibly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://moses.creighton.edu/csrs/news/F96-1.html|title = The History and Future of Papal Infallibility|last = Burke|first = Ronald|date = Fall 1996|work = |access-date = Oct 10, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papal infallibility also belongs to the body of [[bishop]]s as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.catholic.com/tracts/papal-infallibility|title = Papal Infallibility|date = August 10, 2004|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = Catholic Answers|publisher = |last = Brom|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion''' ('''IACSR'''), founded in 2006, is a scholarly association dedicated to the promotion of the [[Cognitive Science of Religion]]. The IACSR is an interdisciplinary association, including scholars from a wide variety of disciplines in the human, social, natural and health sciences that are interested in the academic, scientific study of religious phenomena. The IACSR seeks to advance the naturalistic study of religion. It is strictly scientific and does not encourage or welcome those who are interested in dialogue between science and religion, attempt to find religion in science and science in religion, or attempt to validate religious or spiritual doctrines through cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;[[IACSR]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://www.iacsr.com/Home.html |title=IACSR-Home |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Interpretatio graeca''''' ([[Latin]], "Greek translation" or "interpretation by means of Greek [models]") is a [[discourse]]&lt;ref&gt;Characterized as "discourse" by Mark S. Smith, ''God in Translation: Deities in Cross-Cultural Discourse in the Biblical World'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2008, 2010), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religious concepts and practices]], [[List of Greek mythological figures|deities]], and [[Greek mythology|myths]] are used to interpret or attempt to understand the mythology and religion of other cultures. It is thus a [[Comparative religion|comparative]] methodology that looks for [[Comparative mythology|equivalencies and shared characteristics]]. The phrase may describe Greek efforts to explain others' beliefs and myths, as when [[Herodotus]] describes [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]] in terms of perceived Greek analogues, or when [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Plutarch]] document [[Cultus deorum|Roman cults]], [[Roman temple|temples]], and practices under the names of equivalent Greek deities. ''Interpretatio graeca'' may also describe non-Greeks' interpretation of their own belief systems by comparison or assimilation with Greek models, as when [[ancient Romans|Romans]] adapt Greek myths and iconography under the names of their own gods.

'''''Interpretatio romana''''' is comparative discourse in reference to [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], as in the formation of a distinctive [[Gallo-Roman religion]]. Both the Romans and the Gauls reinterpreted Gallic religious traditions in relation to Roman models, particularly [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

[[Jan Assmann]] considers the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] approach to internationalizing gods as a form of "intercultural translation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great achievement of polytheism is the articulation of a common semantic universe.&amp;nbsp;... The meaning of a deity is his or her specific character as it unfolded in myths, hymns, rites, and so on. This character makes a deity comparable to other deities with similar traits. The similarity of gods makes their names mutually translatable. … The practice of translating the names of the gods created a concept of similarity and produced the idea or conviction that the gods are international.&lt;ref&gt;''Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), pp. 44–54 (quotation p. 45),  as cited by Smith, ''God in Translation,'' p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] expressed the "translatability" of deities as "different names to different peoples" ''(nomina alia aliis gentibus).''&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 2.5.15.&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity made possible the [[syncretism|religious syncretism]] of the [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic era]] and the pre-Christian [[Roman Empire]].

==Examples==
[[File:Hall of the Augustals.jpg|thumb|A Roman fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting [[Hercules]] (from Etruscan ''[[Hercle]]'' and ultimately Greek ''[[Heracles]]'') and [[Achelous]] (patron deity of the [[Achelous River]] in Greece) from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century AD]]
[[Herodotus]] was one of the earliest authors to engage in this form of interpretation. In his observations regarding the Egyptians, he establishes Greco-Egyptian equivalents that endured into the [[Hellenistic era]], including [[Amun|Amon]]/[[Zeus]], [[Osiris]]/[[Dionysus]], and [[Ptah]]/[[Hephaestus]]. In his observations regarding the [[Scythians]], he equates their queen of the gods, [[Tabiti]], to [[Hestia]], [[Papaios]] and [[Api]] to [[Zeus]] and [[Gaia]] respectively, and [[Argimpasa]] to [[Aphrodite Urania]], whilst also claiming that the Scythians worshipped equivalents to [[Herakles]] and [[Ares]], but which he doesn't name.

Some pairs of Greek and Roman gods, such as Zeus and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], are thought to derive from a common [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] archetype ([[Dyeus]] as the supreme sky god), and thus exhibit shared functions by nature. Others required more expansive theological and poetic efforts: though both [[Ares]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] are war gods, Ares was a relatively minor figure in Greek religious practice and deprecated by the poets, while Mars was a father of the Roman people and a central figure of archaic Roman religion.

Some deities dating to Rome's oldest religious stratum, such as [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] and [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminus]], had no Greek equivalent. Other Greek divine figures, most notably [[Apollo]], were adopted directly into Roman culture, but underwent a distinctly Roman development, as when [[Augustus]] made Apollo one of his [[tutelary deity|patron deities]]. In the early period, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan culture]] played an intermediary role in transmitting Greek myth and religion to the Romans, as evidenced in the linguistic transformation of Greek ''[[Heracles]]'' to Etruscan ''[[Hercle|Her[e]cle]]'' to Roman ''[[Hercules]]''.

==''Interpretatio romana''==
The phrase ''interpretatio romana'' was first used by the [[Roman Empire|Imperial-era]] [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Tacitus]] in the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germania'' [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Germania#43 43.]&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus reports that in a [[sacred grove]] of the [[Nahanarvali]]&lt;!--also spelled Naharvali--&gt;, "a priest adorned as a woman presides, but they commemorate gods who in Roman terms ''(interpretatione romana)'' are [[Castor and Pollux]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Praesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu, sed deos interpretatione romana Castorem Pollucemque memorant."&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germania'' [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Germania#9 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; he identifies the principal god of the Germans as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], perhaps referring to [[Wotan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4rezhDpcWwkC&amp;pg=PA251 |title=Robert Leo Odom, '&amp;#39;Sunday in Roman Paganism'&amp;#39; (TEACH 2003 ISBN 978-1-57258242-2), pp. 251-252 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2003-01-01|accessdate=2013-01-24|isbn=9781572582422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sulis Minerva head Bath.jpg|thumb|Gilt bronze head from the cult statue of Sulis Minerva from the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Temple at Bath]]]]

Some information about the deities of the ancient [[Gauls]] (the [[continental Celts]]), who left no written literature other than inscriptions, is preserved by Greco-Roman sources under the names of Greek and Latin equivalents. A large number of [[Gaulish]] [[theonym]]s or cult titles are preserved, for instance, [[Mars (mythology)#Provincial epithets|in association with Mars]]. As with some Greek and Roman divine counterparts, the perceived similarities between a Gallic and a Roman or Greek deity may reflect a common Indo-European origin.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Koch, "Interpretatio romana," in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 974.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lugh]] was identified with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Nodens]] with Mars as healer and protector, [[Sulis]] with [[Minerva]]. In some cases, however, a Gallic deity is given an ''interpretatio romana'' by means of more than one god, varying among literary texts or inscriptions. Since the religions of the [[Greco-Roman world]] were not dogmatic, and [[polytheism]] lent itself to multiplicity, the concept of "deity" was often expansive, permitting multiple and even contradictory functions within a single divinity, and overlapping powers and functions among the diverse figures of each pantheon. These tendencies extended to cross-cultural identifications.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, "Interpretatio romana," in ''Celtic Culture'', pp. 974–975; Assmann, ''Moses the Egyptian'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern empire, the [[Teshub|Anatolian storm god]] with his [[labrys|double-headed axe]] became [[Jupiter Dolichenus]], a favorite cult figure among soldiers. Roman scholars such as [[Varro]] interpreted the monotheistic god of the Jews into Roman terms as [[Caelus]] or [[Jupiter Optimus Maximus]]. Some Greco-Roman authors seem to have understood the Jewish invocation of [[Yahweh]] [[Sabaoth]] as [[Sabazius]].

==''Interpretatio germanica''==
''Interpretatio germanica'' is the practice by the [[Germanic peoples]] of identifying Roman gods with the names of [[Germanic deities]]. According to [[Rudolf Simek]], this occurred around the 1st century of the common era, when both cultures came into closer contact. Some evidence for ''interpretatio germanica'' exists in the Germanic translations of the Roman [[Names of the days of the week|names for the days of the week]]:

* [[Sunday]], the day of [[Sowilō|Sunnǭ]] ({{lang-on|Sunna}}, ''Sól''; {{lang-ang|Sunne}}; {{lang-goh|Sunna}}), the sun (as female), was earlier the day of [[Sol Invictus]], the sun (as male)
* [[Monday]], the day of [[Máni|Mēnô]] (Máni; Mōna; Māno), the moon (as male), was earlier the day of [[Moon|Luna]], the moon (as female)
* [[Tuesday]], the day of [[Tyr|Tīwaz]] (Týr; Tīw; Ziu), was earlier the day of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war
* [[Wednesday]], the day of [[Odin|Wōdanaz]] (Óðinn; Wōden; Wuotan), was earlier the day of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], god of travelers and eloquence
* [[Thursday]], the day of [[Thor|Þūraz/Þunraz]] (Þórr; Þunor; Donar), was earlier the day of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], god of thunder; Þunraz may elsewhere appear identified with the club-wielding [[Hercules]]
* [[Friday]], the day of [[Frijjō]] (Frigg; Frīg; Frīja), was earlier the day of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], goddess of love

In most of the [[Romance languages]], which derive from Latin, days of the week still preserve the names of the original Roman deities, such as the Italian for Tuesday, ''martedì'' (from the Latin ''Martis dies''). This is also the case with Saturn in some [[West Germanic languages]]; such as the English "Saturday", the [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''[[:fy:Sneon|Saterdei]]'', the [[Low German]] ''[[:nds:Saterdag|Saterdag]]'' and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''[[:nl:Zaterdag|zaterdag]]'' all meaning [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]'s day.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Saturday&amp;allowed_in_frame=0]

Simek emphasizes the paucity of evidence and notes that comparison with Roman gods is insufficient to reconstruct ancient Germanic gods and equate them definitively with those of later [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf. (2007) Translated by Angela Hall. ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology''. [[Boydell &amp; Brewer|D.S. Brewer]], p. 74. {{ISBN|0-85991-513-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman equivalents==
The following is a list of Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Egyptian, and Phoenician equivalents, based on usage among the ancients themselves, supported by the analyses of modern scholars.{{cn|date=June 2018}} "Equivalent" should not be taken to mean "the same god". For instance, when the myths or even cult practices of a particular Roman deity were influenced by the Greek or Etruscan tradition, the deity may have had an independent origin and a tradition that is culturally distinctive.

==Application to the Jewish religion==

From the Roman point of view, it was natural to apply the above principle also to the [[Jew]]ish God [[Jehovah]] and equate him with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. However, the Jews – unlike other people living under Roman rule – rejected out of hand any such attempt, regarding such an identification as the worst of sacrilege. This complete divergence of views was one of the factors contributing to the frequent friction between the Jews and the Roman Empire – for example, the Emperor [[Hadrian]]'s decision to rebuild [[Jerusalem]] under the name of [[Aelia Capitolina]], a city dedicated to Jupiter, precipitated the bloodbath of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].

In late antiquity mysticism, the sun god [[Helios]] is sometimes equated to the Judeo-Christian God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/15325/6623]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This is a partial translation from the article in the French wikipedia--&gt;
'''Joseph Antoine Toussaint Dinouart''' (November 1, 1716 &amp;ndash; April 23, 1786) was a preacher, polemicist, compiler of sacred learning, and apologist for French feminism.

Born in [[Amiens]], he was ordained as a priest in there in 1740. In his youth, he showed a talent for [[Latin]] poetry, but soon neglected this in favor of his religious studies. After writing a short essay on women's rights, he had a falling out with his bishop and moved to Paris, where he joined the [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] parish. He soon left, however, to tutor the son of a police lieutenant. This position gave him a stable yearly income and allowed Dinouart to devote himself to the study of literature.

In 1760, he founded the Journal ecclésiastique, which he edited until his death. The collected work of this journal numbers more than 100 volumes. It contains extracts from sermons, treatises on morality and piety, and research on ecclesiastical law and councils.

==Written works==
1. ''Lettre à l'abbé Gouget, au sujet des hymnes de Santeuil, adoptées dans le nouveau Bréviaire''
2. ''Le Triomphe du sexe''
3. ''Éloquence du corps dans le ministère de la chaire''
4. ''Manuel des pasteurs''
5. ''Exercitium diurnum, seu Manuale precum in usum et gratiam sacerdotum ; nunc denuo editum a sacerdote gallicano exsule''

==Translations==
Father Dinouart made numerous translations from Latin, including a translation of Cicero.

==Works edited==
Dinouart served as the editor or compiler of many books and journals. Among these was ''L'art de se taire, principalement en matière de religion'', a nearly perfection transcription of an earlier anonymous work entitled ''Conduite pour se taire et pour parler, principalement en matière de religion''. This was re-issued in Paris in 1987.

==History==
Lighthouse Trails was founded in 2002 by David and Deborah Dombrowski from [[Silverton, Oregon]]. They decided to start the company as an [[apologetics]] outreach in hopes of exposing what they saw as the dangers of the [[Emerging church]] and the [[Contemplative prayer]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lighthousetrails.com/aboutus.htm About Us - LighthouseTrails.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Their research project, named Lighthouse Trails Research, in turn received criticism from [[Moody Bible Institute]] regarding certain areas of belief in the emerging church movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Moody Responds to Lighthouse Trails |url=http://www.moodyministries.net/crp_NewsDetail.aspx?id=7080 |quote=Moody Bible Institute recently became aware of certain assertions made about the Institution by Lighthouse Trails Research Project. |publisher=[[Moody Bible Institute]] |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=March 3, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223140931/http://www.moodyministries.net/crp_NewsDetail.aspx?id=7080 |archivedate=December 23, 2011 }} - Archived via [[Archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/6474712474.html|title=Converge Worldwide (Baptist General Conference)/Bethel University and Seminary Push Questionable Doctrinal Practices|date=Dec 16, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2015|publisher=ChristianNewsWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In spring of 2010 the company saw some major changes, including moving its headquarters to [[Eureka, Montana]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lighthousetrailsresearch.com/blog/?p=4353 We've Moved - Lighthouse Trails Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of the Shepherd's [[Organic food|Organic]] Bible Verse [[Tea]] brand of products,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theshepherdsgarden.com/ The Shepherd's Garden]&lt;/ref&gt; and partnering with author Roger Oakland and his ministry Understand the Times to create the Missions for Truth project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionsfortruth.com Missions for Truth]&lt;/ref&gt; which helps widows and children by working with a group of pastors in western [[Kenya]].

The company advertised in the 2011 and 2014 editions of Christian Writers' Market Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stuart |first=Sally E. |date=December 27, 2010 |title=Christian Writers' Market Guide 2011: The Essential Reference Tool for the Christian Writer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xoP0yphgwVcC&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=%22Lighthouse%20Trails%20Publishing%22&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lighthouse%20Trails%20Publishing%22&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=[[Tyndale House Publishers]] |isbn=9781414334264 |archiveurl=http://postimg.org/image/eumtwiqv9/full/ |archivedate=March 7, 2015 |page=129 |access-date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Jerry B. |date=January 31, 2014 |title=The Christian Writer's Market Guide 2014: Your Comprehensive Resource for Getting Published |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSucAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Lighthouse%20Trails%20Publishing%22&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lighthouse%20Trails%20Publishing%22&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=[[Tyndale House Publishers]] |isbn=9781414390512 |archiveurl=http://postimg.org/image/llrc3x1dz/full/ |archivedate=March 7, 2015 |page=88 |access-date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Living interfaith church web screenshot.png|380px|thumb|right|A screenshot from the Living Interfaith Church's website]]

'''Living Interfaith Church''' is a religious unity founded by Steven Greenebaum and based in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], United States, which embraces the teachings of all [[spirituality|spiritual]] paths that lead people to seek a life of compassionate action.&lt;ref name=meetup&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.meetup.com/Living-Interfaith-Church/|title=Living Interfaith Church|work=[[Meetup (website)]]| accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaith, as a faith, does not seek to discover which religion or spiritual path is "right". Rather, it recognizes that everyone is brother and sister, and that at different times and different places we have encountered the [[sacred]] differently.&lt;ref name=meetup/&gt;

==General information==
===The religion===
Living Interfaith Church celebrates differing spiritual paths. They claim that what is the same  in every [[religion]] is the call to compassion, the call to think beyond ourselves, and to recognize that we are all connected.  Interfaith "calls upon us not to ignore our differences, but to rather to respect them, and to realize that each of our paths, in their own special and different way, call us to love and to be loving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://livinginterfaith.org/?page_id=120|work=livinginterfaith.org|author=|title=Living Interfaith Church FAQ’s |date=| accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church views Interfaith as a faith that celebrates humanity's differing spiritual paths. It believes that a person's actions in this world are what count and that humanity is called to engage the world, both with compassion and with love. A stated tenet of the church is to respect all faith traditions and not to ignore their importance or their differences. [[Christianity]] is acknowledged as different from [[Buddhism]]. [[Islam]] is acknowledged as different from [[Humanism]], and so forth. According to the movement, the claim of Interfaith as a faith is that what is the same within all of humanity’s spiritual paths is the call to compassion, to thinking beyond ourselves, and to recognizing that we are all connected.&lt;ref name="Living Interfaith Church FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | title=Living Interfaith Church FAQ’s | website=Living Interfaith Church | date=July 13, 2013 | url=http://www.livinginterfaith.org/living-interfaith-church-faqs/ | access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenebaum stated that "interfaith, as a spiritual practice, can serve as a new model for how we deal with each other and a new vision for how we act on our religious beliefs to live compassionate lives and share the world in harmony."&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swift|first=Diana|title=Why Faith is Better Than Religion|journal=Anglican Journal|date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The founder===
Reverend Steven Greenebaum, the founder of the Living Interfaith Church, grew up as a [[Reform Jew]] in suburban [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/us/a-religion-that-embraces-all-religions.html?_r=1&amp; |work=|author= Samuel G. Freedman|title=A Church That Embraces All Religions and Rejects ‘Us’ vs. ‘Them’| date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a [[Master's degree]] in [[Mythology]], [[Music]], and [[Pastoral]] Studies. His experiences directing [[Jewish]], [[Methodist]], [[Presbyterian]], and [[Interfaith]] choirs have helped him to understand the profound wisdom of many spiritual traditions. He has dedicated his life to working for social and environmental justice through a multitude of forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.newsociety.com/Contributors/G/Greenebaum-Reverend-Steven|work=|author=|title= Reverend Steven Greenebaum
| date=| accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his entity, he explained: “My faith is Interfaith. My spiritual path is Judaism. My tribe is Humanity. I’m also a minister, choir director, and vegetarian.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.meetup.com/Living-Interfaith-Church/members/13440755/ |work=|author=|title=Rev.

They knew the [[seawater]] was replenishing the rain, which then fell over the ground.{{r|Issitt}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to spirituality:

'''[[Spirituality]]''' may refer to an ultimate or an alleged immaterial [[reality]],&lt;ref&gt;Ewert Cousins, preface to Antoine Faivre and Jacob Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', Crossroad Publishing 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=October 2015}} an [[Involution (philosophy)|inner path]] enabling a person to discover the essence of his/her being, or the “deepest values and meanings by which people live.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Sheldrake]], ''A Brief History of Spirituality'', Wiley-Blackwell 2007 p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=October 2015}}

[[Spiritual practice]]s, including [[meditation]], [[prayer]] and [[contemplation]], are intended to develop an individual's inner life; spiritual experience includes that of [[connectedness]] with a larger reality, yielding a more comprehensive [[self]]; with other individuals or the [[human]] [[community]]; with [[nature]] or the [[cosmos]]; or with the [[Divinity|divine]] realm.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret A. Burkhardt and Mary Gail Nagai-Jacobson, ''Spirituality: living our connectedness'', Delmar Cengage Learning, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Some West Africans were inspired by the [[Indian independence movement]].&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Values and the Educated Class in Africa |first=Ali Al'Amin |last=Mazrui |authorlink=Ali Mazrui |year=1978 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=0-520-03292-6 |page=104 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IA8F6eKRVysC&amp;pg=PA104 |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, educated West Africans formed the [[National Congress of British West Africa]], which modeled its name on the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref name="chamberlain1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Decolonization: The Fall of the European Empires |first=Muriel Evelyn |last=Chamberlain |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-21602-2 |page=11 |pages= |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYMwBRvtb1UC&amp;pg=PA11 |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ali Mazrui]], the facet of the Indian independence movement West Africans found most admirable was the Indian peoples' unity during the struggle.&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt; In 1936, [[H. O. Davies]] said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Africans should follow India &amp;ndash; the only way is for Africans to co-operate and make sacrifices in the struggle for freedom."&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Ali Mazrui,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But the emergence of the Muslim League in India as a serious secessionist movement soon shattered the myth of unity in the Indian model. A new word entered the vocabulary of West African nationalism &amp;ndash; the word was 'pakistanism'."&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ghana]]'s [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and [[Nigeria]]'s [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] became concerned about possible Pakistanization.&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azikiwe1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Zik: a selection from the speeches of Nnamdi Azikiwe |first=Nnamdi |last=Azikiwe |authorlink=Nnamdi Azikiwe |year=1961 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London |isbn= |page=173 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iec7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA173 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention People's Party]]'s 1954 Election Manifesto contain the following message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have seen the tragedy of religious communalism in India and elsewhere. Don't let us give it a chance to take root and flourish in Ghana. Down with Pakistanism!"&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p105"&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Values and the Educated Class in Africa |first=Ali Al'Amin |last=Mazrui |authorlink=Ali Mazrui |year=1978 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=0-520-03292-6 |page=105 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IA8F6eKRVysC&amp;pg=PA105 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pakistanism became a concern in [[Nigeria]]'s independence movement. The primary subdivisions of Nigeria consisted of the [[Hausa-Fulani]]-dominated [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]], the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]-dominated [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]], and the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]-dominated [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]]. In addition to  these ethnic differences, the Northern Region was primarily [[Muslim]], while the Western and Eastern regions were primarily [[Christian]]. In the 1950s, the Northern Region threatened to secede. [[Godfrey Mwakikagile]] noted that it was the Northern region that was the first region threatening to secede.&lt;ref name="mwakikagile1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria |first=Godfrey |last=Mwakikagile |authorlink=Godfrey Mwakikagile |year=2001 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] |location=Huntington, NY |isbn=1-56072-967-8 |page=4 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqTjUjdvTQwC&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1950 General Conference at Ibadan, Northern Region delegates demanded 50% of the seat in Nigeria's legislature, and they threatened to secede if this demand was not met.&lt;ref name="mwakikagile1"/&gt; In 1958, Nnamdi Azikiwe said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is essential that ill-will be not created in order to encourage a Pakistan in this country."&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azikiwe1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original goal of the counter-coup against the government of [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]] on July 29, 1966, was to facilitate the Northern Region's secession from the rest of Nigeria.&lt;ref name="ikein1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oil, democracy, and the Promise of true Federalism in Nigeria |first1=Augustine A. |last1=Ikein |first2=Diepreye S.

In February 2011, Ali Mazrui used the term to describe the division of the [[Sudan]] into Sudan proper, which is primarily Muslim, and [[South Sudan]], which is primarily Christian and [[animism|animistic]].&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/09/sudan-secession-postcolonial-africa |title=Is this Pakistanism in Sudan? |first=Ali |last=Mazrui |authorlink=Ali Mazrui |date=2011-02-09 |work=guardian.co.uk |publisher= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patternism''' is a method of [[Comparative religion|comparing]] the teachings of the [[religions of the Ancient Near East]] whereby the similarities between these religions are assumed to constitute an overarching [[pattern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Siege Perilous: Essays in Biblical Anthropology and Kindred Subjects|author=Samuel H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">'''Playing God''' refers to someone supposedly taking on the role of [[God]] for other purposes, also referred to as [[apotheosis]]. Alleged acts of playing God may include, for example, deciding who is to live or die in a situation where not everyone can be saved. Usually the expression is used to invoke a [[precautionary principle]] or to suggest that someone should refrain from a [[controversy|controversial]] action.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Philip Ball]] wrote an article saying that "playing God" is a meaningless and dangerous cliché,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/05/playing-god-is-a-meaningless-dangerous-cliche/ |title= "Playing God" is a meaningless, dangerous cliché |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher= |author=Philip Ball |date= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that it has no basis in [[theology]]. Instead it was adopted by [[theocon]]s from the 1931 film version of ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', and has been used by journalists to refer to things with which they do not agree. The idea is further discussed in Practical Ethics, a blog linked to Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Practical Ethics - Blog |date= May 26, 2010 |url= http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2010/05/is-playing-god-just-a-meaningless-phrase |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120203191701/http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2010/05/is-playing-god-just-a-meaningless-phrase |dead-url= yes |archivedate= February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positive deconstruction''', in relation to [[Christian apologetics]], is a term first used by [[Nick Pollard]] in ''Evangelism Made Slightly Less Difficult''&lt;ref name=emsld&gt;[[Nick Pollard]], ''Evangelism Made Slightly Less Difficult'' (Leicester: IVP, 1997) pp. 48–56.&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing on Dr. David Cook),&lt;ref name=cook&gt;E. David Cook, ''Blind Alley Beliefs'' 2nd ed. (Leicester: Inter-Varsity Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a methodology for engaging with [[worldview]]s in Christian apologetics. The process is one of ''deconstruction'' because it involves 'dismantling' the worldview in order to identify areas of conflict with a Christian worldview. It is ''positive'' because the intention is not to destroy a person's ideas and belief system, but to build on areas of agreement between the two worldviews in order to argue for the truth of the Christian worldview.

Pollard identifies four key aspects:

* '''Identify the worldview:''' What beliefs, values and attitudes are being communicated?
* '''Analyse the worldview,''' primarily in terms of the [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]], [[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]] and [[Pragmatic theory of truth|pragmatic]] theories of truth
* '''Affirm the truth:''' what aspects of the worldview are in agreement with a Christian worldview?
* '''Deny the error:''' what aspects of the worldview are in conflict with a Christian worldview?

Tony Watkins develops this in relation to film in ''Focus: The Art and Soul of Cinema''.&lt;ref name=focus&gt;Tony Watkins, ''Focus: The Art and Soul of Cinema'' (Milton Keynes and Tyrone, GA: Damaris, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He aims to make the positive deconstruction process more accessible, and accordingly re-labels the four aspects of the process (pp.&amp;nbsp;31–45):

* '''Analyse the worldview''', in which he suggests a five-part framework for considering worldviews:
** What is reality?
** What does it mean to be human?
** How do we know what the good is?
** How do we know anything at all?
** What is the fundamental problem confronting all human beings, and what is the solution?
* '''Evaluate the worldview''' (as with Pollard's second stage, this is terms of correspondence, coherence, pragmatism)
* '''Celebrate the good'''
* '''Challenge the bad'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8225">'''''Religio licita''''' ("permitted religion,"&lt;ref&gt;''Licita'' is the [[past participle]] of ''licet'', "is permitted, is lawful."&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as "approved religion"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a phrase used in the ''[[Apologeticus|Apologeticum]]'' of [[Tertullian]]&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Apologeticum'' 21.1.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the special status of the [[Jews in the Roman Empire]]. It was not an official term in [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Francis Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts: The Social and Political Motivations of Lucan Theology'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 1996), p. 211, begins his analysis of the ''religio licita'' theory "by immediately scotching the idea that Rome had some process for licensing foreign religions. There is no historical support for this whatsoever; … there never was a juridical category of ''religio licita''." See also Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', p. 35; Solomon Grayzel, "The Jews and Roman Law," ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', 59 (1968), pp. 93-117; [[Ben Witherington III]], ''The Acts of the Apostles: A Socio-rhetorical Commentary ''(Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1997), p. 542; John J. O'Keefe, entry on "Religio licita," in ''A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it occurs in only one [[Church Fathers|patristic text]] and in no [[classical antiquity|classical]] Roman sources or inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, 2006), p. 449; Tessa Rajak, "Was There a Roman Charter for the Jews?" ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 74 (1984), pp. 107-123. As Stephen Wilson, ''Related Strangers: Jews and Christians, 70–170 C.E.'' (Augsburg Fortress, 1995, 2005), p. 68, has noted, ''religio licita'' "is not a Roman but a Christian concept."&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase has spawned abundant scholarly conjecture on its possible significance. Some scholars have gone so far as to imagine that all religions under the Empire had a legal status as either ''licita'' or ''illicita'', despite the absence of any ancient texts referring to these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations: Claiming a Place in Ancient Mediterranean Society'' (Augsburg Fortress, 2003), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme view has held that Tertullian's phrase means all foreign religions required a license from the Roman government.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 206, taking note of Foakes Jackson and Kirsopp Lake, B.S. Easton, and the early work of H.J. Cadbury as examples of this extreme of interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Roman custom to permit or even encourage the subject peoples of the [[Roman province|provinces]] and foreign communities in Rome to maintain their ancestral religion, unless specific practices were regarded as disruptive or subversive:&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'', p. 449; Jörg Rüpke, "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; "A ''religio'' was ''licita'' for a particular group on the basis of tribe or nationality and traditional practices, coupled with the proviso that its rites were not offensive to the Roman people or [[List of Roman deities|its gods]]."&lt;ref&gt;W. H. C. Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian uses the phrase in a passage arguing that Christians should be granted the same [[freedom of religion|freedom to practice their religion]] as any other inhabitant of the Empire; the passage itself, and not the phrase ''religio licita'', is evidence of the general [[religious tolerance|tolerance]] afforded under [[Religion in ancient Rome|the Roman system of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Ames, "Roman Religion in the Vision of Tertullian," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism as ''licita''==
''Religio licita'' has sometimes been taken as a formal recognition or [[charter]] originating with [[Julius Caesar]] and embodied by various pieces of Roman legislation pertaining to the Jews, conceived of as a coherent policy.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian: A Study in Political Relations'' (2nd ed.; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1981), p. 539 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the various privileges and exemptions granted to the Jews were responses to specific complaints or requests, made in the context of the traditional [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage network]],&lt;ref&gt;Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations'', pp. 221–222; Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'', 13 (1994) pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and had nothing to do with a supposed ''religio licita'' status.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that the Romans respected Judaism, it was because of the religion's great antiquity, ancestral tradition being regarded as a source of social and political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "[[Roman magistrates]] treated the Jews the way they did not because they were consciously tolerant, but simply because they had no reason to hinder the free exercise of Jewish religious practices."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'' 13 (1994), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity as ''illicita''==
Some scholars have argued that Christianity was declared a ''religio illicita'' (an impermissible or illegitimate religion) by [[Domitian]] in the [[80s]] AD.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey E.M. de Ste. Croix, "Why Were the Early Christians Persecuted?" ''Past and Present'', 26 (1963), pp. 6-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this term appears nowhere, it has been conjectured that a declaration of Christianity as ''illicita'' was the legal basis for official persecutions. There was, however, "no law, either existing section of criminal law, or special legislation directed against the Christians, under which Christians were prosecuted in the first two centuries."&lt;ref&gt;J.E.A. Crake, "Early Christians and Roman Law," ''Phoenix'' 19 (1965), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome lacked a uniform policy or legal code pertaining to foreign cults,&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Barnes, "Legislation against the Christians," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 58 (1968), 50&lt;/ref&gt; and before Christian hegemony in the 4th century, there was no legal language to designate a concept analogous to "[[heresy]]" or crimes against orthodox religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, "Roman Policy," p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Constantine the Great]], [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] and other religions became tolerated with the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313. Toleration did not extend to religions that practiced [[human sacrifice]], such as [[Druidism]]. This state of affairs lasted until 380, when [[Nicene Creed|Nicene Christianity]] was adopted as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]], after which time [[Historical_persecution_by_Christians#Roman_Empire|persecution]] of non-Christian and non-Nicene cults began. [[Priscillian]] was executed for heresy in 385, and [[Theodosius I]] began outlawing Rome's traditional religious rituals in 391.

==History==
Religion News Service was founded in 1934 by [[journalist]] Louis Minsky as an independent, nonprofit affiliate of [[The National Conference for Community and Justice|National Conference of Christians and Jews]]. It is a secular news agency that does not endorse or promote any particular creed, faith or tradition. The ''United Methodist Reporter'' bought RNS in 1983, and in 1994, Newhouse News Service, a major publisher of daily newspapers and magazines, purchased it and changed its name to Religion News Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/about/history/|title=Religion News Service - History|work=Religion News Service|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, RNS was sold to the Religion Newswriters Foundation, a nonprofit affiliate of the [[Religion Newswriters Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.religionnews.com/press-releases/religion-news-service-enters-nonprofit-partnership-with-religion-newswriter/|title=Religion News Service Enters Nonprofit Partnership with Religion Newswriters Foundation|work=RNS press release, 19 May 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNS is owned by Religion News LLC, a nonprofit, limited-liability corporation led by CEO and publisher Thomas Gallagher,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/ncr-contributor-named-ceopublisher-religion-news-service|title=NCR contributor named CEO/Publisher of Religion News Service|date=2016-11-02|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and based at the [[Missouri School of Journalism|University of Missouri School of Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2012/0516-national-network-of-religion-sites-fills-gap-for-religion-news/|title=MU News Bureau {{!}} MU News Bureau|website=munews.missouri.edu|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNS is governed by a Board of Managers, including [[Jerry Pattengale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://religionnews.com/about/board/|title=RNS Board of Managers - Religion News ServiceReligion News Service|website=religionnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in partnership with Religion News Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://religion.news|title=Religion News Foundation - Journalists covering religion|website=Religion News Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Controversy==
{{Undue weight section|date=May 2016}}
In April 2015, the [[Catholic News Agency]] (CNA) published an article disclosing that RNS had received a grant of $120,000 from the [[Arcus Foundation]], an [[LGBT]]–rights advocacy organization, with the stated intent “to recruit and equip LGBT supportive leaders and advocates to counter rejection and antagonism within traditionally conservative Christian churches.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/an-arcus-news-service-rns-denies-lgbt-money-influences-religion-coverage-29061/ | title=An Arcus news service? RNS denies LGBT money influences religion coverage | work=Catholic News Agency | date=1 April 2015 | accessdate=19 April 2015 | author=Jones, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNA story questioned whether the grant had biased RNS's coverage of traditional religion, specifically citing an RNS article on [[Cardinal Raymond Burke]]. In response to the CNA report, RNS's then editor-in-chief Kevin Eckstrom denied that the Arcus grant had any influence over editorial decisions at RNS and noted that the grant language is “Arcus’ description of their funding, not ours.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cruxnow.com/life/2015/04/08/religion-news-service-defends-grant-from-gay-rights-group/| title=Religion News Service defends grant from gay-rights group | work=Crux | date=8 April 2015 | accessdate=19 April 2015 | author=O'Loughlin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant proposal to the Arcus Foundation had stressed only the need to “increase and improve domestic and international coverage of how religion affects a diverse range of LGBT communities.”

The relationship between '''religion and divorce''' is complicated and varied. This article attempts to summarize the dominant views in a number of major world faiths.

|Description   = Cartoon parodying the 1906 divorce proceedings of [[Anna Gould]] (an American [[Inheritance|heiress]] and [[socialite]]) and [[Boni de Castellane]] (a French [[nobleman]]) in [[Paris]], France. Boni de Castellane then sought an annulment from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] so that he could be free to remarry in the Church. The annulment case was not finally settled until 1924, when the highest Vatican tribunal upheld the validity of the marriage and denied the annulment.

}}
The great majority of [[Christian denominations]] affirm that marriage is intended as a lifelong covenant, but vary in their response to its dissolubility through divorce. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] treats all [[consummate]]d [[Sacraments|sacramental]] marriages as permanent during the life of the spouses, and therefore does not allow remarriage after a divorce if the other spouse still lives and the marriage has not been [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulled]]. However, divorced Catholics are still welcome to participate fully in the life of the church so long as they have not remarried against church law, and the Catholic Church generally requires civil divorce or annulment procedures to have been completed before it will consider annulment cases. Annulment is not the same as divorce - it is a declaration that the marriage was never valid to begin with.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;''Divorce in Christianity'' at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/divorce_1.shtml www.bbc.co.uk] retrieved 17 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian denominations, including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and many [[Protestant]] churches, will allow both divorce and remarriage even with a surviving former spouse, at least under certain conditions. For example, the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], in its 2014 Discipline, teaches:&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"/&gt;
{{quotation|We believe that the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph. 5:22, 23). We deplore the evils of divorce and remarriage. We regard adultery as the only scripturally justifiable grounds for divorce; and the party guilty of adultery has by his or her act forfeited membership in the church. In the case of divorce for other cause, neither party shall be permitted to marry again during the lifetime of the other; and violation of this law shall be punished by expulsion from the church (Matt. 5:32; Mark 10:11, 12). In the carrying out of these principles, guilt shall be established in accordance with judicial procedures set forth in ''The Discipline''.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In societies that practised [[Puritan]]ism, divorce was allowed if one partner in the marriage was not completely satisfied with the other, and remarriage was also allowed. The [[Church of England]] also took an indissolublist line until 2002, when it agreed to allow a divorced person to remarry in church under exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Bible commentary on divorce comes primarily from the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and the epistles of Paul. [[Expounding of the Law#Divorce|Jesus taught on the subject of divorce]] in three of the [[Gospels]], and Paul gives a rather extensive treatment of the subject in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] chapter 7: "Let not the wife depart from her husband...let not the husband put away his wife" (1 Corinthians 7:10-11), but he also includes the [[Pauline privilege]].  He again alludes to his position on divorce in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], albeit an allegory, when he states "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. . . . So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress" (Romans 7:2-3).

In {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:31-32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1-10|KJV}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1-5|KJV}}, Jesus came into conflict with the [[Pharisees]] over divorce concerning their well-known controversy between [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]] about {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:1-4|KJV}}—as evidenced in [[Nashim]] Gittin 9:10 of the [[Mishnah]]. Do Jesus’ answers to the Pharisees also pertain to Christians? Are Christians who adopt these teachings [[Judaizers]]? The differences in opinions about these questions usually arise over whether Jesus [[Antinomianism|opposed the Law of Moses]] or just some of the viewpoints of the Pharisees, and whether Jesus just addressed a [[Jewish Christians|Jewish audience]] or expanded his audience to include Christians, for example "all nations" as in the [[Great Commission]].    
Since Deuteronomy 24:1-4 did not give Jewish women the right to directly initiate a divorce (See ''[[Agunah]]''), did Jesus' answers "in the house" to his disciples expand the rights of women or did they merely acknowledge that some Jewish women, such as [[Herodias]] who divorced Herod Boethus, were wrongfully taking rights because Jewish women were being assimilated by other cultures? (See {{bibleverse||Matthew|14:3-4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:10-12|KJV}}.) In other words, did Jesus confine his remarks to the Pharisaical questions, and did he appeal to his own authority by refuting the oral authority of the Pharisees with the formula [[Expounding of the Law|"You have heard...But I say to you"]] in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:20-48|KJV}}? Expressions used by Jesus such as "you have heard", "it hath been said", "it is written", "have you never read", "keep the commandments", "why do you break the commandments with your traditions?" and "what did Moses Command you?" seem to indicate that Jesus generally respected the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and sometimes opposed [[Oral law|Pharisaical Opinions]]. He was [[Woes of the Pharisees|critical of the Pharisees]].

==Buddhism==
Buddhism has no religious concept of marriage (see [[Buddhist view of marriage]]). In Buddhism, marriage is a secular affair, subject to local customs.

==Islam==
{{main|Divorce in Islam}}
{{See also|Sharia}}

According to the Quran, marriage is intended to be unbounded in time, but when marital harmony cannot be attained, the Quran allows the spouses to bring the marriage to an end (2:231).&lt;ref name=EoQ-279&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Harald Motzki | year= 2006 | title=Marriage and divorce|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|volume=3|page=279|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The main traditional legal categories are ''talaq'' (repudiation), ''khulʿ'' (mutual divorce), judicial divorce and oaths. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Modern Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by [[sharia]], as interpreted by [[Fiqh|traditional Islamic jurisprudence]], and they differed depending on the [[Madhhab|legal school]].&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Historical Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical practice sometimes diverged from legal theory.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; In modern times, as personal status (family) laws were codified, they generally remained "within the orbit of Islamic law", but control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern/&gt;

==Judaism==
[[Judaism]] has always accepted divorce as a fact of life, though an unfortunate one: e.g., see [[Deuteronomy]] chapters 22 and 24.  Judaism generally maintains that it is better for a couple to divorce than to remain together in a state of bitterness and strife. It is said that ''[[shalom bayit]]'' (domestic harmony) is a desirable state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/divorce.htm Judaism 101/divorce]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, it is accepted that for a Jewish divorce to be effective the husband must hand to the wife, and not vice versa, a bill of divorcement, called a [[get (divorce document)|get]], which also acts as proof of the divorce. From ancient times, the get was considered to be very important to show all those who needed to have proof that the woman was in fact free from the previous marriage and free to remarry. In Jewish law, besides other things, the consequences of a woman remarrying and having a child while still legally married to another is profound: the child would be a [[mamzer]], to be avoided at any cost. Also, the woman would be committing [[adultery]] should she remarry while still legally married to another. An enactment called '''Herem de-Rabbenu Gershom''' (literally, the proscription of [[Gershom ben Judah#Synod and bans|Rabbenu Gershom]])--accepted universally throughout European Jewish communities—prohibited a husband from divorcing his wife against her will.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim; [http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"], ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish law divorce is an act of the parties to the marriage, which is different from the approach adopted by many other legal systems. That is, a Jewish divorce does not require a decree from a court. The function of the court, in the absence of agreement between the parties, is to decide whether the husband should be compelled to give the ''get'' or for the wife to accept the ''get''. But, notwithstanding any such ruling, the parties remain married until such time as the husband actually delivers the ''get''.

Jewish law, in effect, does not require proof or even an allegation of moral or other fault by either party. In the first place, as noted above, if both parties agree to a divorce and follow the prescribed procedure, then the court would not need to establish responsibility for the marriage break-down. In the second place, if either party does not wish to continue co-habiting with the other is sufficient [[grounds for divorce]]. (Anything else, it is said, would amount to rape of the woman.) In this sense it is a "no-fault" approach to divorce. This approach has been accepted for thousands of years {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. It was the approach advocated by followers of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], a very influential school of thought in ancient [[Judea]], which predated the current era. This is the approach which is now generally accepted in most, if not all, Jewish communities around the world.

On the other hand, the refusal of a husband to give his wife a [[get (divorce document)|get]] (the document) can be for purely vindictive or even extortion motives. This situation has resulted in numerous social problems in modern times. For example, where pre-nuptial agreements are enforceable in civil courts, appropriate provisions may be made to compel the giving of the get by the husband in the event of a civil divorce being obtained. A woman who has been refused a get is typically referred to as an "[[agunah]]".

A wife can initiate a divorce process on several grounds (including lack of satisfaction in her sexual life).  However, this right extends only so far as petitioning a court to force her husband to divorce her. Also see ''Jewish Attitude Toward Divorce''.&lt;ref&gt;

and [[Get (conflict)|Get in the Conflict of Laws]].

Furthermore, from the philosophical and mystical point of view, divorce is a unique procedure of tremendous importance and complexity, because it nullifies the holiest of connections that can exist in the Universe (similar to a connection between a person and God).  Because of the danger of the birth of illegitimate children ([[mamzer]]im) if the process is not performed properly, and because divorce law is extraordinarily complex, the process is generally supervised by experts.

In some Jewish mythologies, Adam had a wife before Eve named [[Lilith]] who left him. The earliest historically documentation of this legend appears in the  8th-10th centuries ''[[Alphabet of Ben Sira]]''. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known.

===Greek mythology===

After finding he intended to marry [[Glauce]]; for what Jason said was political ties; [[Medea]] murdered Glauce and her father with a burning dress; than proceeded to kill her own children Tisander and Alcimenes fearing they would be imprisoned. Afterwords she left to [[Athens]] on a chariot of dragons given to her by her grandfather Helios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wicca===
The [[Wicca]]n equivalent of a divorce is described as a ''handparting''. Wiccans traditionally see either a high priest or high priestess to discuss things out before a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;A Handbook for Wiccan Clergy - Page 60, Kevin M. Gardner - 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However a handfasting (marriage) that falls apart peacefully does not necessarily need a handparting.&lt;ref&gt;All One Wicca: A Study in the Universal Eclectic Tradition of Wicca - Page 110, Kaatryn MacMorgan - 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unitarian Universalism===
In [[Unitarian Universalism]], divorce is allowed and should be a decision by the individual person and is seen as ending a rite of passage. Such divorces have sometimes taken the form of divorce rituals as far back as the 1960s. Divorces are largely seen as a life choice.&lt;ref&gt;Searching for Spiritual Unity...Can There Be Common Ground? Robyn E Lebron - 2012 Page 571&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[baptism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] are given a [[Christian name]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |title=Christian Names |year=1911 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |publication-place=[[New York City|New York]] |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10673c.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should not be "foreign to Christian sentiment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7K.HTM#$295 Code of Canon Law, canon 2156]&lt;/ref&gt; and is often the name of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=207 Catholic Activity: Baptismal Names]&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.

====Confirmation name====
In some countries, it is common to adopt a [[Confirmation#Confirmation name|confirmation name]], in addition to the baptismal name.

====Monastic and papal name====
In some [[religious institute]]s, a new member takes a [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their ''[[:it:al secolo]]'' name. A [[Papal election|newly elected]] [[Pope]] also takes on a new name, called his [[regnal name]] or [[papal name]].

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
====Baptism name====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by [[baptism]] or [[chrismation]]. A person's religious name is always the name of a [[saint]], who then becomes that person's [[patron saint]]. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their "[[name day]]" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.

====Monastic name====
Orthodox [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s are often given a new monastic name at the time of their [[tonsure]] (i.e., when they take their [[monastic vows]]). A monastic name is usually the name of a [[prophet]] or a [[monastic]] saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.

==Judaism==
[[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] take a [[Hebrew name]] upon conversion.  Born Jews generally have a [[patronymic]] Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their [[legal name]], especially when the latter is of [[gentile]] or non-Hebrew origin.

==Buddhism==
Many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects also practice this, with newly ordained [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given [[Dharma name]]s during their [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge ceremony]].

==Others==

===Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
Members of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] and some other [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] organisations are given a "spiritual name" by their [[guru]] upon initiation. This name ends in "Das" or "Dasa" for men and "Dasi" for women (meaning "servant"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.

===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], a [[craft name]] is often used.

===Parody religions===
It is usual for a [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Discordian Episkopos]] to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related [[Church of the SubGenius]].

Stephen Evans 1996, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-826397-X}} page v&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be the most influential person to have ever lived by many, finding a significant place in numerous cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bauckham|first1=Richard|title=Jesus: A Very Short Introduction|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|isbn=978-0199575275|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Jesus in Christianity|Christianity teaches]] that Jesus is the [[Messiah]] (Christ) foretold in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Son of God]] [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnate]]. Christians believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Bible' p.649"&gt;''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' p.649&lt;/ref&gt; These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".&lt;ref name=anselm &gt;''The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury'' by Dániel Deme 2004 {{ISBN|0-7546-3779-4}} pages 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cullmann &gt;''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 {{ISBN|0-664-24351-7}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt; Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.

In [[Islam]], Jesus (commonly transliterated as ''[[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]]'') is one of God's highest-ranked and most-beloved [[prophets of Islam|prophets]]. Islam considers Jesus to be neither the incarnation nor the Son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (''[[tawhid]]'') and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'').

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers Jesus to be a [[manifestation of God]], who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world. Bahá'ís reject the idea that divinity was contained with a single human body.

Apart from his own [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s and followers, the [[Jews]] of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today. Mainstream [[Judaism|Jewish]] scholars argue that Jesus neither fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah.
[[Sikhism]] views Jesus as a high-ranked Holy man or saint. 

Other world religions such as [[Buddhism]] have no particular view on Jesus, and have but a minor intersection with Christianity. For non-religious perspectives on Jesus, see [[historical Jesus]].

==Christianity==
{{main article|Jesus in Christianity}}
{{See also|Ministry of Jesus|Parables of Jesus|Miracles of Jesus|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}
[[Jesus in Christianity|Christian views of Jesus]] are based on the teachings and beliefs as outlined in the [[Canonical gospels]], [[New Testament|New Testament letters]], the [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]], as well as specific denominational teachings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schreiner|first=Thomas R.|title=New Testament Theology: Magnifying God in Christ|year=2008|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2680-5|pages=23–37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elw8xkVeTTUC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their [[catechism|catechetical]] or [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first= Gregory L. |title= Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison|year= 1993 |isbn= 978-0-615-16635-3| pages= 11–17 |publisher=Christian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, adhering to the Christian faith requires a belief that Jesus is the [[Son of God]] and the ''[[Messiah]]'' or ''[[Christ]]''. Jesus refers to himself as the Son of God in the New Testament.&lt;ref name=OneTeacher &gt;''One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel'' by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 {{ISBN|3-11-018151-7}} pages 240-241&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians consider Jesus to be the Messiah ([[Christ]]) and believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Bible' p.649"/&gt; These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".&lt;ref name="anselm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cullmann"/&gt; The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s disobedience.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg &gt;''Systematic Theology, Volume 2'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303&lt;/ref&gt;

The five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus are his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], Crucifixion, Resurrection and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].&lt;ref name=digby &gt;''Essays in New Testament interpretation'' by Charles Francis Digby Moule 1982 {{ISBN|0-521-23783-1}} page 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key'' by Vigen Guroian 2010 {{ISBN|0-8028-6496-1}} page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 /&gt; These are usually bracketed by two other episodes: his [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] at the beginning and the sending of the [[Paraclete]] at the end.&lt;ref name=digby /&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 &gt;''Scripture in tradition'' by John Breck 2001 {{ISBN|0-88141-226-0}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel accounts of the teachings of Jesus are often presented in terms of specific categories involving his "works and words", e.g. his [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]], [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] and [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]].&lt;ref name=Zuck100 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary'' by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 {{ISBN|0-88207-812-7}} page 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WPent212 &gt;''The words and works of Jesus Christ'' by J. Dwight Pentecost 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-310-30940-6}} page 212&lt;/ref&gt;  The words of Jesus include several sermons, in addition to parables that appear throughout the narrative of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] (the gospel of John includes no parables).

Christians not only attach theological significance to the works of Jesus, but also to his name. Devotions to the [[Holy Name of Jesus]] go back to the [[Early Christianity|earliest days of Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Sylvester &gt;''Outlines of dogmatic theology, Volume 2 by Sylvester Hunter 2010 {{ISBN|1-146-98633-5}} page 443&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Houlden &gt;''Jesus: the complete guide'' by Leslie Houlden 2006 {{ISBN|0-8264-8011-X}} page 426&lt;/ref&gt; These devotions and feasts exist both in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Church|Western Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Houlden"/&gt;

===Incarnation===
{{Further information|Incarnation (Christianity)|Christology}}
Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there have been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Christians generally believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]], [[God the Son]], and "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, [[Incarnation (Christianity)|having become fully human]] in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. According to the [[Bible]], God raised him from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|2:24|NIV}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|10:9|NIV}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|15:15|NIV}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|2:31-32}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40-41}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30-31}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|6:14}}, {{bibleref2|2Cor|4:14}}, {{bibleref2|Gal|1:1}}, {{bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{bibleref2|Col|2:12}}, {{bibleref2|1Thess|1:10}}, {{bibleref2|Heb|13:20}}, {{bibleref2|1Pet|1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]], to the "right hand of God,"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mark|16:19}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|22:69}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|2:33}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:31}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|7:55-56}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|8:34}}, {{bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{bibleref2|Col|3:1}}, {{bibleref2|Hebrews|1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|1:13}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|10:12}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|12:2}}, {{bibleref2|1Peter|3:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he will [[Second Coming|return again]] for the [[Last Judgment]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Bibleref2|John|14:1-3}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:10-11}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|21:27}}, {{Bibleref2|Revelation|1:7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{main article|Jesus in Islam}}
{{See also|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}
In Islam, Jesus (''Isa'') is considered to be a [[Apostle (Islam)|messenger]] of God (''[[Allah]]'') and the Messiah (''[[Messiah#Islam|al-Masih]]'') who was sent to guide the [[Israelites|Children of Israel]] (''Bani Isra'il'') with a new scripture, the Gospel.&lt;ref name="CEI"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7tu12gt4JYC&amp;pg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Islam | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | last=Glassé | first=Cyril | year=2008 | pages=270–271 | isbn=978-0-7425-6296-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|year=2003|first=John L. |last=Esposito |page= 158|publisher=Oxford University Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E324pQEEQQcC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-975726-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quran]] mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than [[Muhammad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aboul-Enein|first=Youssef H.|title=Militant Islamist Ideology: Understanding the Global Threat|year=2010|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-015-6|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tX3suVDTJz0C&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and emphasises that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message.&lt;ref name="comparative"&gt;{{cite book|title=Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach|first1=Darrell J.|last1= Fasching |first2= Dell |last2=deChant|year=2001| pages= 241, 274–275 |isbn=978-0-631-20125-0 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Christian writings, the Quran  does not describe Jesus as the [[son of God]], but as one of four major human [[Rasul|messengers]] (out of many [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]]) sent by God throughout history to guide mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|publisher=Chapel Hill:University of North Carolina Press|author=Annemarie Schimmel|date=1975|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is said to have lived a life of piety and generosity, and abstained from eating flesh of swine (or of any animals, according to some Muslim authors, even some who were not vegetarians themselves).

Muslims also believe that Jesus received a Gospel from God, called the ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]''. However, Muslims hold that Jesus' original message was [[tahrif|lost or altered]] and that the Christian New Testament does not accurately represent God's original message to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Bockmuehl |editor-first= Markus N. A. |title=Quests for the historical Jesus |first=James C. |last=Paget |year=2001|encyclopedia= Cambridge companion to Jesus|publisher= Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-521-79678-1|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some major differences, the Quran and New Testament overlap in other aspects of Jesus' life; both Muslims and orthodox Christians believe that Jesus was miraculously born without a human biological father by the will of God, and that his mother, Mary (''[[Mary in Islam|Maryam]]'' in Arabic), is among the most saintly, pious, chaste and virtuous women ever.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John. ''What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam''. New York: University Press, 2002. P31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran also specifies that Jesus was able to perform [[miracle]]s&amp;mdash;though only by the will of God&amp;mdash;including being able to raise the dead, restore sight to the blind and cure lepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Diane|title=Essential Islam: A Comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36025-1|pages=45–46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; One miracle attributed to Jesus in the Quran, but not in the New Testament, is his being able to speak at only a few days old, to defend his mother from accusations of [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|27|e=33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also says that Jesus was a 'word' from God, since he was predicted to come in the [[Old Testament]].

Most Muslims believe that he was neither killed nor crucified, but that God made it appear so to his enemies. With the noteworthy exception of [[Ahmadi]] Muslims who believe that Jesus was indeed put on the cross, survived the crucifixion and was not lifted bodily to the heaven, majority of Muslims believe that Jesus ascended bodily to heaven and is alive. Majority of the Muslim population does not consider Ahmadi Muslims to be Muslims and consider them as Infidels due to their unorthodox perspectives. Some Muslim scholars maintain that Jesus was indeed put up on the cross, but did not die on it; rather, he revived and then ascended bodily to heaven. Others say that it was actually [[Judas Iscariot]] who was mistakenly crucified by the Romans. Regardless, Muslims believe that Jesus is alive in [[heaven]] and will return to the world in the flesh to defeat the [[Antichrist]], once the world has become filled with sin, deception and injustice, and then live out the rest of his natural life.&lt;ref name="CEI"/&gt;

Islam rejects the [[Trinity|Trinitarian Christian]] view that Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] or the [[son of God]], that he was ever crucified or resurrected or that he ever [[Atonement in Christianity|atoned]] for the sins of mankind. The Quran says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the Last Judgment, and God will vindicate him.{{Cite quran|5|116}}

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Judaism's view of Jesus}}
[[Judaism]] rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God. Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the [[Jewish Messianism|Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled the [[Messianic prophecies]] in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after [[Malachi]], who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], "[http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]]&amp;nbsp;— ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&amp;o=350 Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah?]", [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Conservative Judaism]], Jews who believe Jesus is the Messiah have "crossed the line out of the Jewish community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html|title=Messianic Jews Are Not Jews|accessdate=January 15, 2008|last=Waxman|first=Jonathan|year=2006|publisher=[[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]]|quote=Judaism has held that the Mashiach will come and usher in a new era; not that he will proclaim his arrival, die and wait centuries to finish his task.

===Jesus in Jewish writings===
{{See also|Jesus in the Talmud}}
The [[Babylonian Talmud]] include stories of ''[[Yeshu]]'' {{lang|he|יֵשׁוּ}}; the vast majority of contemporary historians disregard these as sources on the [[historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name="TM1998"&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Talmud scholars view these as comments on the relationship between Judaism and Christians or other sectarians, rather than comments on the historical Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Boyarin, ''Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Rubenstein ''Rabbinic Stories'' (The Classics of Western Spirituality) New York: The Paulist Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', an authoritative work of [[halakha|Jewish law]], states in ''Hilkhot Melakhim'' 11:10–12 that Jesus is a "stumbling block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God".
{{quote|Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].

And they stumbled."{{Bibleref2c|Dan.|11:14}} Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the [[prophet]]s spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments.

So that it is said, "Because then I will turn toward the nations (giving them) a clear lip, to call all of them in the name of God and to serve God (shoulder to shoulder as) one shoulder."{{Bibleref2c|Zeph.|3:9}} Look how all the world already becomes full of the things of the Messiah, and the things of the [[Torah]], and the things of the commandments!

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] consider Jesus to be a [[manifestation of God]], who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bahá'í belief, the Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single [[progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive religion]] from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Progressive revelation |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifestations of God are taught to be "one and the same", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. [[Bahá'u'lláh]] wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes, they can be seen as the spiritual "return" of all the previous Manifestations of God.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; In this way, Bahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is, in both respects, the return of Jesus.

==Other==
Traditionally, Buddhists as a group take no particular view on Jesus, and [[Buddhism and Christianity]] have but a minor intersection. However, some scholars have noted similarities between the life and teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Jesus]]. These similarities might be attributed to Buddhist missionaries sent as early as Emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 BCE in many of the Greek [[Seleucid]] kingdoms that existed then and then later became the same regions that Christianity began.&lt;ref&gt;Old World Encounters. Cross-cultural contacts and exchanges in pre-modern times" by Jerry H.Bentley (Oxford University Press, 1993) {{ISBN|0-19-507639-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus was seen as the savior and bringer of [[gnosis]] by various [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sects, such as the extinct [[Manichaeism]]. In the [[Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam|Ahmadiyya Islamic view]], Jesus survived the crucifixion and later travelled to [[India]], where he lived as a prophet (and died) under the name of [[Yuz Asaf]].

In [[Jesus in Scientology|Scientology]], the teachings of Jesus are included among belief systems comprising those "earlier forms".&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;{{cite book | last =Rhodes | first =Ron | title =The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions: The Essential Guide to Their History, Their Doctrine, and Our Response | publisher =Zondervan | year =2001 | pages =155, 164 | isbn = 0-310-23217-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is classified as below the level of [[Operating Thetan]], but as a "shade above" the Scientology state of "[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]".&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;

In [[Raëlism]], Jesus and several other religious figures are considered prophets sent by an extraterrestrial race called the [[Elohim]].&lt;ref name="other views"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hutson | first =Steven | title =What They Never Taught You in Sunday School: A Fresh Look at Following Jesus | publisher =City Boy Enterprises | year =2006 | page =57 | isbn = 978-1-59886-300-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVnT_hSpSBAC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/raelians.htm | title=Raelian Movement | publisher=About.com | accessdate=June 13, 2013| first= Catherine |last=Beyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of [[Religious Science]] consider Jesus to be a teacher of [[Science of Mind]] principles, but reject his unique divinity, arguing that every person is equally divine.&lt;ref name="other views" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jashow.org/Articles/_PDFArchives/apologetics/AP2W0105.pdf | title=What Does Religious Science Teach About Jesus? | publisher=Ankerberg Theological Research Institute | accessdate=June 13, 2013|first1=John |last1=Ankerberg |first2=John |last2=Weldon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rot op met je religie''''' (English: ''To Hell With Your Religion'') is a 2017 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] television series by the [[Evangelische Omroep]], presented by Kefah Allush.

== Setting and purpose ==
In this [[Reality television|reality show]], four [[religion|religious people]] (two [[Christianity|Christians]], a [[Islam|Muslim]] and a [[Judaism|Jew]]) and two [[atheism|atheists]] live together in the same house in [[Haarlem]], and discuss and debate their religious beliefs, practices and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7LJvru7g4U |title=De Nieuwe Maan - Rot op met je religie |work=De Nieuwe Maan |publisher=[[Omroep NTR|NTR]] |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features mutual [[criticism of religion]] as well as [[interfaith dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/rot-op-met-je-religie/ |title=Rot op met je religie |author=Thimo den Hartog |publisher=Evangelische Omroep |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants also travel across the Netherlands to visit [[Place of worship|houses of worship]], an [[abortion clinic]] and a [[Dhabihah|halal]] [[slaughterhouse]] amongst other places, and cook together despite their widely varying ethical views on food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/filmenuitgaan/rtv/26697584/__EO__Rot_op_met_je_geloof__.html |title=EO: Rot op met je geloof |author=Marcel Frost |work=[[De Telegraaf]] |date=28 September 2016 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/de-ultieme-religiestress-test-in-rot-op-met-je-religie-op-npo2/ |title=De ultieme religiestress-test in ‘Rot op met je religie’ op NPO2 |publisher=Evangelische Omroep |date=6 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EO hopes the programme will show what 'religious stress'&lt;ref&gt;The neologism ''religiestress'' ("religious stress") was coined in 2012 by Dutch theologian Tom Mikkers, who works for the EO.&lt;/ref&gt; does to the candidates, and what effect this has on their beliefs. Just before the first episode was broadcast, the EO published a survey about religious stress amongst Dutch citizens, which showed amongst other things that 93% of the population is in favour of [[freedom of speech]], and 82% supports [[freedom of religion]], but almost half think that [[secularism|religion should not be professed in public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.rd.nl/kerk-religie/eo-nederlanders-ervaren-dilemma-s-rond-religie-1.1365904 |title=EO: Nederlanders ervaren dilemma’s rond religie |work=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]] |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the EO made similar programmes about [[refugee]]s (''Rot op naar je eigen land'', "Piss Off To Your Own Country", 2015) and [[environmental issue]]s (''[[Rot op met je milieu]]'', "Get Lost With Your Environment", 2016).&lt;ref name="Heesakkers"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/televisie/een-hoop-pleuris-en-religiestress-in-rot-op-met-je-religie~a4450288/ |title=Een hoop pleuris en religiestress in 'Rot op met je religie' |author=Gidi Heesakkers |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=18 January 2017 |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Stichting KijkOnderzoek, a [[Nielsen ratings|ratings tracking]] service, reported that about 531,000 people watched the first episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nieuwwij.nl/nieuws/ruim-half-miljoen-kijkers-rot-op-religie/ |title=Ruim half miljoen kijkers voor 'Rot op met je religie' |work=NieuwWij.nl |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', the EO used the programme to deliberately fan the flames of religious stress, and by their selection of participants created an unfair representation of the various worldviews: "The [[casting]] wants us to primarily look for reasonableness amongst the four religious participants (...). Even the two non-believers clash occasionally, because one is [[veganism|vegan]] and the other finds that to be politically correct bullshit. In short: in the first episode, the religious stress isn't quite fairly distributed yet between the followers of [[God]] and those who reject the existence of the fairytale character of god."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/01/17/de-eo-stookt-de-religiestress-nog-op-6246021-a1541592 |title=De EO stookt de religiestress verder op |author=Hans Beerekamp |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three episodes, ''[[de Volkskrant]]'', too, concluded that "the EO does everything within their power to let all hell break loose. There is no live and let live." Just like in the previous ''Rot op'' series, the programme would primarily be "about confrontation, heated discussions and perhaps a vain hope of reconciliation." It noted that the most fierce nonbeliever, Floris, "is portrayed the least sympathetic by the montage so far." On the preview of the fourth episode, in which Safeer shows his unease when meeting a [[Islam and homosexuality|gay Muslim]], the newspaper's reviewer (referencing [[Genesis 1:4]]) commented: "Someone saw the announcement, and saw it was not good. ''Stress!''"
&lt;ref name="Heesakkers"/&gt;

A critic from ThePostOnline disagreed with the ''Volkskrant'''s criticism of the montage: "By definition, media select that which is appetising." On the contrary, 'sensational television' is interesting, especially to discover who 'understands the art of living and tolerance best'. In his opinion, the atheist and vegan Floris, "whose raised voice against his religious fellow man may go into Dutch television history as legendary", drawing the comparison to the late politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], finishes last in this regard, followed by the imam Safeer, whilst sympathy for the atheist Bryan is growing throughout the series, and the Jewish Sheila has had the audience's sympathy from the beginning. Furthermore, the EO allegedly lacked a sense of humour, and the idea of 'let it be' would only rarely feature in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.tpo.nl/2017/01/19/rot-op-religie-minder-minder-minder-veganisten/ |title=Rot op met je religie: Minder, minder, minder veganisten |author=Peter Olsthoorn |work=ThePostOnline |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scientific study of religion''' represents the systematic effort by scholars and researchers to investigate religious phenomena, as well as the sociology of church participation. 

The [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]] was founded in 1949 by scholars in religion and social science, and it publishes the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', a quarterly which "offers perspectives on national and international issues such as brainwashing and cults, religious persecution, and [[right wing authoritarianism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0021-8294&amp;site=1 |title=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion - Wiley Online Library |publisher=Blackwellpublishing.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for the Scientific Study of Religion (CSSR) at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] is a leading center for the sociology of religion, and particularly for the study of religious influences on human behavior and population outcomes. The CSSR went offline in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/cssr/about_the_center/about_the_center.htm | publisher=University of Texas at Austin | work=Center for the Scientific Study of Religion (CSSR) | title=About the Center | accessdate=September 7, 2015 | author=Roemer, Michael K.| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609010657/http://www.prc.utexas.edu/cssr/about_the_center/about_the_center.htm | archivedate=June 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Does the CSSR still exist?

The relationship between '''Scientology and other religions''' is very complex. While [[Scientology]] claims that it is fully compatible with all existing major world religions and that it does not conflict with them or their religious practices, there are major differences in beliefs and practices between Scientology and most religions, especially the major [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions. Members are not allowed to engage in other similar mental therapies or procedures, religious or otherwise.&lt;ref name="Steve_Bruce"&gt;Steve Bruce: ''Cathedrals to cults: the evolving forms of the religious life''. In: Paul Heelas (Hrsg.): ''Religion, Modernity, and Postmodernity'', Blackwell, Oxford 1998, pp. 19-35, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some ministers from other churches have adopted some Scientology secular programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/02/18/Worldandnation/Scientology_awards_re.shtml Scientology awards reach out to black community] ROBERT FARLEY, St. Petersburg Times, February 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Matt |last= Sedensky |title= Unlikely allies |url= http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/aug/25/Unlikely-allies/ |work= [[Associated Press|AP]] |publisher= [[Knoxville News Sentinel]] |date= 2007-08-25 |accessdate= 2007-08-30 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070901004306/http://knoxnews.com/news/2007/aug/25/Unlikely-allies/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jacob Neusner]], Scientology is a "synthesis of existing ideas and a reflection of particular cultural, social, and historical circumstances in which it was born and developed". The religion reflects Western and American values, such as "beliefs in democracy, individualism, and freedom", while borrowing little from religions based on the Bible. Similarities exist between Scientology and eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neusner |first1=Jacob |title=World Religions in America |edition=4 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
The Church of Scientology has capitalized on the religion's similarity to Buddhism to win followers in historically Buddhist-influenced countries like [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="taibud"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/07/scientology-in-taiwan/493493/|title=The Curious Rise of Scientology in Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Frank K. Flinn called Scientology technological Buddhism, however, it can be differentiated from Buddhist asceticism as its aim is not the eradication of pain through the removal of desire or detaching oneself from the world. Furthermore, it has nothing in common with Buddhist prayer offerings; it is not contemplative, but action-oriented and practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Dericquebourg |first=Regis |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Affinities between Scientology and Theosophy |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church of England==
The [[Church of England]] complained in March 2003 to the Advertising Standards Authority about the Church's advertising poster promoting Narconon—the drug rehabilitation program based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. The poster claimed "250,000 people salvaged from drugs." The Church of England Diocese of Birmingham challenged the claim. Upholding the complaint, the ASA considered that, "without clarification, readers were likely to interpret the claim '250,000 people salvaged from drugs' to mean that 250,000 people had stopped being dependent on street or prescription drugs because of Scientology. The Authority "accepted that more than 250,000 people had undertaken the Church's Drug Purification and Drug Rundown programs, which were designed to free people from the effects of taking drugs," but "the Authority understood that, within Scientology, the concept of 'drug use' referred to a variety of behaviors that ranged from heavy use of street drugs to occasional ingestion of alcohol or prescription medicines and exposure to chemical toxins."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?adjudication_id=35676 Advertising Standards Authority record] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041255/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?adjudication_id=35676 |date=2007-09-28 }} of successful Church of England complaint about Narconon advertisement&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglican Diocese of Birmingham|Diocese of Birmingham]] objected to Scientology using space in the community centre allotted for religious use. The Diocese pointed out that Scientology does not have religious status in the UK: "Scientology has rightly been refused recognition as a religion by the UK Charity Commissioners" in the words of a Diocese spokesman.&lt;ref name="Diocese"&gt;{{cite web |first= James |last= Cartledge |title= Church anger at 'cult' space |url= http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100localnews/tm_method=full%26objectid=14177182%26siteid=50002-name_page.html |work= [[Birmingham Mail|Evening Mail]] |publisher= |date= 2004-04-24 |accessdate= 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diocese also stated that Scientology is "as much a religion as a dog is a vegetable."&lt;ref name="Diocese"/&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox Church==
[[Maximos (Aghiorgoussis)|Maximos Aghiorgoussis]], the [[bishop]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]] in Pittsburgh, has stated that Scientology is not in fact a "church", but rather a [[gnosticism|gnostic]] or [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] system of thought. He went on to say that there are at least six serious points of contention between the two groups, including:
*the [[pantheism|pantheistic]] nature of Scientology,
*Scientology's contention that the individual is a noncorporeal, semi-divine "[[thetan]]," which runs contrary to the Greek Orthodox view that the individual is both body and soul and, while created in the image of God, not a god himself,
*Scientology's belief that the universe is the "result of a game of the thetans", rather than the account of the [[Genesis creation narrative]],
*Scientology's belief that the thetan can be saved through the clearing of its [[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], which differs from the [[salvation (Christianity)|Christian view of salvation]] being only through Christ, and
*Scientology's view that death is "of no consequence and significance because death is repeated innumerable times", which runs contrary to the Christian view of a single physical incarnation.

He also states that "Scientology teaches that psychic powers, (evil) spirits, and out-of-body events can be used in order for the thetans to rediscover their true powers. Because of this, there have been parallels drawn between Scientology and [[occultism]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. He goes on to say that, in spite of Scientology's claims to enhance mental health, that many people have already been damaged by Dianetics. Calling upon what he describes as "unclean spirits", the inexperience of those who do [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] cause "hallucination, irrational behavior, severe disorientation, strange bodily sensations, physical and mental illness, unconsciousness, and suicide. Hubbard admitted most of the above hazards, 'although he maintained that they occurred only through misapplication of the technology of Scientology'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=67293442&amp;sid=5&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientld=39419&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD "The challenge of metaphysical experiences outside Orthodoxy and the Orthodox response"] at ProQuest&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2001, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] criticized Scientologists, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unificationism|Unificationists]], and [[Mormonism|Mormons]] as being dangerous "totalitarian sects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zenit.org/english/archive/0105/ZE010503.htm#5134 "Russian Orthodox Targets 'Totalitarian Sects'"] at [[Zenit News Agency]][https://web.archive.org/web/20060708213901/http://zenit.org/english/archive/0105/ZE010503.htm#5134 Archive copy] at the [[Internet Archive Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran Church==
The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] in Germany has criticized Scientology's activities and doctrines, along with those of several other religious movements. According to the U.S. State Department's 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, "The Lutheran Church also characterizes [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), the Jehovah's Witnesses, the [[Church of Christ]], [[Christian Scientists]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], and the [[Johannische Church]] as 'sects,' but in less negative terms than it does Scientology."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41683.htm "2004 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Germany"] at [[United States Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholic Church==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has not made official doctrinal pronouncements specifically related to Scientology, however Cardinal Marc Ouellet stated "Scientology is something else. For me, this community is not a Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bussières |first= Ian |title= Scientologie: "Ce n'est pas une Église" - Mgr Ouellet |work= [[Le Soleil (Quebec)|Le Soleil]] |publisher= [[Power Corporation of Canada]] |date= February 5, 2009 |url= http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/societe/200902/04/01-824289-scientologie-ce-nest-pas-une-eglise-mgr-ouellet.php |accessdate= 2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain beliefs that are widely associated with Scientology, such as [[reincarnation]], are specifically rejected by the Catholic Church as being incompatible with Catholic belief and practice. Scientology is also, according to a number of religious scholars, a form of [[gnosticism]], which would make it hard to reconcile with Roman Catholicism and other denominations that regard gnosticism as a [[Christian heresy|heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tirdad |last=Derakhshani |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/special_packages/sunday_review/12042623.htm |title=Spirituality through therapy |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2006-07-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New religious movement scholar Douglas E. Cowan compares the basic auditing session in Scientology to the Roman Catholic confessional. He writes, “the auditing session is about confession – the discovery, revelation, and absolution of critical life experiences.” He differentiates the two, however, the confession is mediated by the physicality of the screen and auditing is mediated by the e-meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Cowan |first=Douglas E. |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Clearly Material: Objects, Meaning, and the Ongoing Construction of New Religious Reality |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nation of Islam==
Scientology’s relationship with the [[Nation of Islam]] is related to its inclusivity of other denominations, according to scholar Donald A. Westbrook. This relationship developed since 2009, with 4000 members of the NOI receiving introductory training as auditors with the endorsement of NOI Leader Louis Farrakhan.&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Westbrook |first1=Donald A. |title=Handbook of Scientology |chapter=Researching Scientology and Scientologists in the United States: Methods and Conclusions |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Nation of Islam (NOI) announced in an official newspaper that an estimated 700 NOI members have become certified Hubbard Dianetics Auditors, with more NOI members soon to be trained in Scientology techniques.&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"&gt;reference: https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/06/07/black-supremacist-nation-islam-pushes-white-dominated-scientology&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrakhan is known to encourage his congregation to read Dianetics and receive training for auditing. Eliza Gray comments on a comparison and contrast of the two religions, asserting that “at the core of both religions is a never-ending pursuit of a better self. In the case of Scientology, that best self is ‘clear’ of residual traumas buried in the subconscious. In the Nation [of Islam], that self is free of hang-ups of white culture that black people have internalized to their detriment.” Farrakhan has taught his followers to seek truth wherever it is contained, despite the inherent contradiction of following Hubbard’s teaching while he poses resistance to the “whites.” He declares to his followers that L. Ron Hubbard has made “white people better than they are,” describing Hubbard’s Dianetics as a way for “whites to expunge themselves from ‘devilish’ qualities.”&lt;ref&gt;reference: https://newrepublic.com/article/108205/scientology-joins-forces-with-nation-of-islam&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrakhan supports Hubbard’s spiritual technology, including auditing, which he claims is a “vital tool” for the awakening of his people. Leah Nelson writes that Farrakhan “has been telling his followers to embrace Scientology in order to move closer to perfection in preparation for the end times.”&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"/&gt; Farrakhan has commented on the complementary and supplementary role that Scientology has on NOI. He does not necessarily view Dianetics training as conversion into Scientology, rather, he views Hubbard’s technologies as tools for “black empowerment and betterment which contribute to his particular theological vision for Muslims in America,” as Donald A. Westbrook writes.&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"/&gt;

Speculating on the curious embracement by Farrakhan of Scientology doctrine, Chip Berlet of the Southern Poverty Law Center, hypothesizes: “The possibility exists that Farrakhan sees his followers as not ‘clear’ enough to make contact with the ‘Mothership.&lt;ref&gt;reference: "Clearing the Planet: The Adoption of the Teachings of L. Ron Hubbard by Louis Farrakhan, and its Significance for the Eschatology of the Nation of Islam” by Jacob Michael King, Claremont Graduate University, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald Williams asserts that just like NOI, Scientology is a “very rationalized or modern religion.” Jacob Michael King states that both religions are “engaged in reframing traditional spiritual ideas, and both employ scientific language in an attempt to “modernize” elements seen as outdated.” Dianetic Auditing runs parallel with NOI’s determination of the knowledge of self. “While self-knowledge in the NOI offers the believer an identity as part of a collective, auditing through ‘locating areas of spiritual distress… and improving their condition’ purports to free the individual to determine herself and to better author her own destiny,” states Jacob King.&lt;ref&gt;reference: Willms, Gerald. “Scientology: ‘Modern Religion’ or ‘Religion of Modernity’?” In Scientology, ed. James R. Lewis (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), Nook Edition, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Chicago, Inglewood, Hollywood and Clearwater are the loci of NOI Dianetics training. The Church of Scientology Community Center in Inglewood also functions as a Sunday meeting place for NOI members. Scientologists have also worked with NOI-lead initiatives to reduce crime rites in the Los Angeles inner cites, using the Scientology-sponosored program [[The Way to Happiness]].&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"/&gt;

==Hubbard's definition of religion==
In 1970, Hubbard offered an old-fashioned view of religion that included some broad ideas: “In a few words, religion can be defined as belief in spiritual beings. More broadly, religion can be defined as a system of beliefs and practices by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of human life. The quality of being religious implies two things: first, a belief that evil, pain, bewilderment and injustice are fundamental facts of existence; second, a set of practices and related sanctified beliefs that express a conviction that man can ultimately be saved from those facts.”&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Images of Religions and Religious History in the Works of L. Ron Hubbard |journal=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |year=2016 |last=Frenschkowski |first=Marco|doi=10.5840/asrr20166620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious compatibility==
Scientology's claim of religious compatibility to entry-level Scientologists is soon modified by the additional teaching that the various levels of spiritual process which can be reached through Scientology are more advanced than those attainable in other religions. The major [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions and Scientology share the claim of [[Universality (philosophy)|Universality]] of their belief system which precludes compatibility in the view of most scholars.&lt;ref name="Steve_Bruce" /&gt; Critics point out that, within Scientology, "spiritual abilities" tends to be synonymous with "mystical powers" rather than with "inner peace." Hubbard himself cautioned against the unwise or improper use of powers in his book ''History of Man''.

In its application for tax-exempt status in the United States, the Church of Scientology International states:

{{cquote|Although there is no policy or Scriptural mandate expressly requiring Scientologists to renounce other religious beliefs or membership in other churches, as a practical matter Scientologists are expected to and do become fully devoted to Scientology to the exclusion of other faiths. As Scientologists, they are required to look only to Scientology Scriptures for the answers to the fundamental questions of their existence and to seek enlightenment only from Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;Response to Final Series of IRS Questions Prior to Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) As a Church, October 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard discussed Buddhism in an early 1952 lecture in London, speaking about Buddhist reincarnation stories, about the Christian God and other religious topics. While theologian Marco Frenschkowski claims that Hubbard may have been experimenting with ways Scientology is similar to Buddhism, some scholars such as [[Frank A. Flinn]] and Stephen A. Kent interpret the Scientology founder's "reverence for Buddhism as a rather awkward response to external pressure." Hubbard clarified that Scientology is not a neo-Buddhist group.&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"/&gt; Scientology and Buddhism differ in that in Scientology there is no concept of Nirvana. According to religious scholar Aldo Natale Terrin, in Buddhism, adherents aim to the suppression of the mind which is in direct opposition to the Scinetologist idea of "transparency to himself".&lt;ref name="Terrin 2014"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Terrin |first=Aldo Natale |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Scientology and Its Contiguity with Gnostic Religion and Eastern Religions |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard sometimes identified himself with [[Maitreya]] (Metteya in [[Pali]]), a [[prophecy|prophesied]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] of the future. This identification is made most strongly in his 1955–1956 poem ''[[Hymn of Asia]]'',&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"/&gt; which begins with the line "Am I Metteyya?" and emphasizes certain traits of Hubbard that the editors of the publication said matched traits predicted by the "Metteya Legend," such as Metteya appearing in the West, having golden hair or red hair (Hubbard was red-haired), and appearing in a time of world peril, with the earliest of the predicted dates for his return being 2,500 years after [[Gautama Buddha]], or roughly 1950. According to the sociologist [[Stephen A. Kent]], however, the traits which the editors say are predicted by the "Metteya Legend" either are not actually present in the Buddhist texts or in some cases are contradicted by the texts: instead of coming at a time of world peril, for instance, the predictions about Maitreya say he will be born to royalty whose domain is "mighty and prosperous, full of people, crowded and well fed," and rather than having hair "like flames," Kent says that the texts predict curly black hair for the Maitreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kent |first=Stephen A. |authorlink=Stephen A. Kent |year=1996 |title=Scientology's Relationship With Eastern Religious Traditions |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=21 |url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Scientology's%20Relationship%20With%20Eastern%20Religious%20Traditions%20.htm |accessdate=2007-03-31 |doi=10.1080/13537909608580753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revealed beliefs in Scientology at higher levels become increasingly contradictory with the world's major religions. The concept of past lives in Scientology is at odds with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Beliefs concerning the origins and age of the Earth, the root of evil, and the nature of man make it impossible to uphold the beliefs of most other religions while also being a Scientologist. Hubbard claimed that Islam was the result of an extraterrestrial memory implant, called the Emanator, of which the [[Kaaba]] is supposedly an artifact. Mainstream religions, in his view, had failed to realize their objectives: "It is all very well to idealize poverty and associate wisdom with begging bowls, or virtue with low estate. However, those who have done this (Buddhists, Christians, Communists, and other fanatics) have dead ended or are dead ending."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, HCO PL of January 21, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The section of the [[Fishman Affidavit]] pertaining to Operating Thetan level VIII put forward that Hubbard said that [[Jesus]] was a [[pederast]]. The Church of Scientology has consistently held this section of the Fishman Affidavit to be a [[forgery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karin Spaink]]. The Fishman Affidavit: introduction. Retrieved 2008-02-29. [http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/fishman/index2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Richard Holloway writes that the underlying principle in Scientology is the ancient Hindu doctrine of reincarnation or samsara, but without nirvana. Scientologists believe in the immortality of souls that travel from one body to another in a span of a trillion years, without final salvation or damnation. “There is only the eternal return of life after life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holloway |first1=Richard |title=A Little History of Religion |publisher=Yale University Press |date=September 20, 2016 |isbn=978-0300208832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious scholar Aldo Natale Terrin describes the similarity of Scientology and Gnostic thought, comparing the convergent concepts of the “Thetan” (spiritual) of Scientology and the “Demiurge” or half-god of Gnostic religion. Both the thetan and demiurge struggle against the [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]], there are stages of ascent (as in the [[Operating Thetan]] stages) just as the equivalent “ascent” of the demiurge or soul. Terrin also mentions the parallelism of Gnostic thought, Buddhism and Scientology, where the idea of “mindfulness” in Buddhism is similar to the Gnostic thought of “awareness.” Scientology’s version of mindfulness is the “transparency of the spirit.” Frank Flinn stresses that the similarities between Buddhism and Scientology include the following: (1) “Knowing for oneself,” or “personal experience” as criterion of truth; (2) “The scientific understanding of cause and effect” in matters of the Spirit (karma); (3) Buddhism’s “pragmatic” approach without any other metaphysic vision; and (4) the emphasis on individual action. Hubbard’s clearest mention of his Gnostic worldview is in The Factors, a brief document and Hubbard’s 1953 lecture on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Org Organization |journal=The Journal of CESNUR |year=2018 |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |volume=2 |issue=2 |issn=2532-2990 |accessdate=2018-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard has made direct references to the comparison between Scientology and eastern religions: “But are we indebted to Asia?… All of us have the same potentials, but it happens that the information which has been collected over the years is available in Asia. It has been not preserved in the Western world. Therefore, we look to such things as the [[Vedas|Veda]].” Hubbard says in the Phoenix Lectures: “And what we have just talked about in terms of knowing the way to Knowingness, is very, very closely associated here with Buddha, or Lord Buddha, or Gautama Buddha, or the Blessed One, or the Enlightened one.”

In a study that compares Scientology with Eastern religions, scholar [[Roy Wallis]] wrote that there are a lot of parallelisms between Hindu yoga and Scientology. In Hindu yoga, the yoga system would lead to a knowledge where the rebirth bring about a “non conditioned mode of being” and the aim of Samkhya-yoga would consist in the dissociation of purusha (immortal spirit) from prakrti (matter). Now, the same would be the aim of Scientology in seeking to dissociate the Thetan – equivalent to purusha (immortal, free, divine) – in the attempt to liberate the self from the MEST (matter, prakrti).

L. Ron Hubbard taught that Scientology is the science of “knowing how to know,” corresponding to the perpetually “curious” disposition of the true Scientologist, without claiming access to revelation. This is similar to the idea of “how to invent the new reality and freedom,” in Gnostic thought, where knowledge is accompanied by imagination.&lt;ref name="Terrin 2014"/&gt;

Hubbard had a basic skepticism about religious claims, even about the existence of God. On July 1950, upon addressing a child’s queries about the existence of angels, he clearly showed that he was talking about something that didn’t exist. On March 1954, he talked about mysticism, spiritualism, and  “guardian angels and priests and all this sort of thing as the requirement  to inquire from nothingness for direction.” When referring to God he mentions “taking orders from an indefinite nothingness.” Dianetics does not mention God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frenschkowski |first1=Marco |title=Brill Handbook of Scientology |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |work=Brill Hanbbooks on Contemporary Religion |location=Boston |publisher=Brill |year=2016 |isbn=9789004328716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar Mikael Rothstein, just as Jesus is the sole object of religious devotion and source of salvation, and the church is seen as an "extension" of Jesus' divinity, "the entire fabric of Scientology is best understood as an expansion of the individual, L. Ron Hubbard, including the buildings currently emerge as physical manifestations of Scientological ideals and virtues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SoF movement started in 1984 as a response to [[Don Cupitt]]'s book and [[Sea of Faith (TV series)|television series]], both titled ''Sea of Faith''.&lt;ref name="Bill Cooke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Bill|title=Dictionary of Atheism, Skepticism, and Humanism|year=2005|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst NY|isbn=978-1591022992|pages=470|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sA6_jqohqRUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cupitt was educated in both science and theology at the University of Cambridge in the 1950s, and is a philosopher, theologian, [[Anglican]] priest, and former Dean of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt: Life Fellow and former Dean of Emmanuel College Cambridge, England|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/Fellows/cupitt.html|publisher=Westar Institute|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book and TV series, he surveyed western thinking about religion and charted a transition from traditional realist religion to the  view that religion is simply a human creation.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Stangroom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stangroom|first1=Jeremy|last2=Baggini|first2=Julian|authorlink1=Jeremy Stangroom|authorlink2=Julian Baggini|title=What Philosophers Think|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=London|isbn=978-0826484741|pages=95–104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P6jT10cRPXQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Sea of Faith is taken from [[Matthew Arnold]]'s nostalgic mid 19th century poem "[[Dover Beach]]", in which the poet expresses regret that belief in a supernatural world is slowly slipping away; the "sea of faith" is withdrawing like the ebbing tide.&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt sea of faith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cupitt|first=Don|title=The Sea of Faith|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521344203|pages=21–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCXcdgWck_8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=don+cupitt+dover+beach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fLrsUL3zC6j22gWH_YGICw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the television series, a small group of radical Christian clergy and laity began meeting to explore how they might promote this new understanding of religious faith. Starting with a mailing list of 143 sympathisers, they organised the first UK conference in 1988.&lt;ref name="Peter B. Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Peter B.|title=Encyclopedia Of New Religious Movements|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415453837|pages=595}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second conference was held in the following year shortly after which the SoF Network was officially launched. Annual national conferences have been a key event of the network ever since.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts|url=http://www.thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com/Religious_Studies/Phil_of_Rel/Atheism_Agnosticism/sea_of_faith_network.php|work=That Religious Studies Website|publisher=Pelusa Media Group|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Sea Of Faith Network holds national and regional conferences and promotional events each year. There is an active network of local groups who meet regularly for discussion and exploration.&lt;ref name=sofn&gt;[http://www.sofn.org.uk/ Sea of Faith Network] retrieved 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's magazine ''Sofia'' is published bi-monthly in the United Kingdom. It has a circulation beyond the SoF membership. The group also maintains a web site and an on-line discussion group.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

Currently there are national networks in the UK, New Zealand and Australia with scattered membership in the USA, Northern Ireland, South Africa, France and The Netherlands. The world-wide membership, as of 2004, stood at about 2,000. Each national network is run by a steering committee elected from its members.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Beliefs==
SoF has no official creed or statement of belief to which members are required to assent, seeing itself as a loose network rather than a formal religious movement or organisation. Its stated aim is to "explore and promote religious faith as a human creation".&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are|url=http://www.sofn.org.uk/sof/who_we_are.html|publisher=Sea of Faith Network|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this it spans a broad spectrum of faith positions from uncompromising non-realism at one end to critical realism at the other.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are" /&gt;  Some members describe themselves as on the liberal or radical wing of conventional belief (see [[liberal Christianity]]) while others choose to call themselves [[religious humanism|religious]] or [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] (see [[humanism]]). Some even refer to themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply nontheist (see [[Christian atheism]]).

SoF possesses no religious writings or ceremonies of its own; many members remain active in their own religion (mainly but not exclusively Christian) while others have no religious affiliation at all.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Philosophy==
A number of commentators have identified SoF as closely associated with the non-realist approach to religion.&lt;ref name="andrew moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Andrew|title=Realism and Christian Faith: God, Grammar, and Meaning|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521524155|pages=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54AgRQ0QbZIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cathey&gt;{{cite book|last=Cathey|first=Robert Andrew|title=God In Postliberal Perspective: Between Realism and Non-Realism|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Burlington VT|isbn=978-0754616801|pages=188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLkVppp6cfcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to the belief that God has no "real", objective, or empirical existence, independent of human language and culture; God is "real" in the sense that he is a potent symbol, metaphor or projection, but he has no objective existence outside and beyond the practice of religion.&lt;ref name="peter mullen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mullen|first=Peter|title=Faith and Reason Cupitt's arrows lie blunted by the reality of reasoned discussion|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/faith-and-reason-cupitts-arrows-lie-blunted-by-the-reality-of-reasoned-discussion-1391036.html|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=31 Dec 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-realism therefore entails a rejection of all supernaturalism, including concepts such as miracles, the afterlife, and the agency of spirits.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network|url=http://www.stoa.org.uk/topics/sof/sea-of-faith-network.html|publisher=Faversham Stoa|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cupitt wrote, "God is the sum of our values, representing to us their ideal unity, their claims upon us and their creative power".&lt;ref&gt;''Taking Leave of God'', Don Cupitt, SCM, 1980, 2001 edition: {{ISBN|0-334-02840-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cupitt calls this "a voluntarist interpretation of faith: a fully demythologized version of Christianity".&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt; It entails the claim that even after we have given up the idea that religious beliefs can be grounded in anything beyond the human realm, religion can still be believed and practised in new ways.&lt;ref name="Gail Vines"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vines|first=Gail|title=A Godless creed|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=99906&amp;sectioncode=26|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=19 July 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder's influence==
Since he began writing in 1971, Cupitt has produced 36 books. During this time his views have continued to evolve and change.&lt;ref name="nigel leaves"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaves|first=Nigel|title=Odyssey on the Sea of Faith: The Life &amp; Writings of Don Cupitt|year=2004|publisher=Polebridge Press|location=Santa Rosa CA|isbn=978-0944344620|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his early books such as ''Taking Leave of God'' and ''The Sea of Faith'' Cupitt talks of God alone as non-real,&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God|url=http://philosophybites.com/2008/11/don-cupitt-on-nonrealism-about-god.html|work=philosophy bites|publisher=Institute of Philosophy|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the 1980s he moved into [[postmodernism]], describing his position as empty radical humanism:&lt;ref name="About Non-Realism"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Non-Realism|url=http://www.doncupitt.com/non-realism|publisher=Don Cupitt|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, there is nothing but our language, our world, and the meanings, truths and interpretations that we have generated. Everything is non-real, including God.&lt;ref name=hyman&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyman|first=Gavin|title=The Predicament of Postmodern Theology: Radical Orthodoxy or Nihilist Textualism?|year=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville KY|isbn=978-0664223663|pages=44–49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VuXIL7amXvIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Cupitt was the founding influence of SoF and is much respected for his work for the network, it would not be true to say that he is regarded as a guru or leader of SoF. Members are free to dissent from his views and Cupitt himself has argued strongly that SoF should never be a fan club.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;  Both Cupitt and the network emphasise the importance of autonomous critical thought and reject authoritarianism in all forms.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15041">'''Spiritual direction''' is the practice of being with people as they attempt to deepen their relationship with the [[divinity|divine]], or to learn and grow in their own personal [[spirituality]].  The person seeking direction shares stories of his or her encounters of the divine, or how he or she is cultivating a life attuned to spiritual things.  The director listens and asks questions to assist the directee in his or her process of [[Introspection|reflection]] and spiritual growth. Spiritual direction advocates claim that it develops a deeper awareness with the spiritual aspect of being human, and that it is not [[psychotherapy]], counseling, or financial planning.

== Forms ==
While there is some degree of variability, there are primarily two forms of spiritual direction: regular direction and [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] direction. They differ largely in the frequency of meeting and in the intensity of reflection.

Regular direction can involve a one- to two-hour meeting every four to eight weeks, and thus is slightly less intense than retreat direction, although spiritual exercises and disciplines are often given for the directee to attempt between meetings.

If the directee is on a retreat (lasting a weekend, a week or even 40 days), he or she will generally meet with his or her director on a daily basis for one hour. During these daily meetings, exercises or spiritual disciplines such as [[lectio divina]] are given to the directee as fodder to continue his or her spiritual growth. Alternatively, retreat centres often offer direction or companionship to persons visiting the centre alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rivendellretreat.org/personal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510043839/http://www.rivendellretreat.org/personal.html |archivedate=2012-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola]] are a popular example of guidelines used for spiritual direction.

== Historical traditions ==

=== Western Christianity ===
Within [[Christianity]], spiritual direction has its roots in [[early Church|Early Christianity]].  The [[gospel]]s describe [[Jesus]] serving as a mentor to his disciples. Additionally, [[The Book of Acts|Acts of the Apostles]] Chapter 9 describes Ananias helping [[Paul of Tarsus]] to grow in his newfound experience of Christianity.  Likewise, several of the [[Pauline epistles]] describe Paul mentoring both Timothy and Titus among others.  Tradition tells us that [[John the Evangelist]] tutored [[Polycarp]], the 2nd-century bishop of [[Smyrna]].

Theologian [[John Cassian]] who lived in the 4th century provided some of the earliest recorded guidelines on the Christian practice of spiritual direction.&lt;ref name=christ&gt;{{cite web | title = Got Your 'Spiritual Director' Yet? |publisher= [[Christianity Today]] | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/aprilweb-only/4-28-51.0.html?paging=off 
|date=April 1, 2003| accessdate = 2014-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He introduced mentoring in the monasteries. Each novice was put under the care of an older monk. [[Benedict of Nursia]] integrated Cassian's guidelines into what is now known as the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]].

Spiritual direction is widespread in the Catholic religion: a person with wisdom and spiritual discernment, usually but not exclusively a priest or consecrated in general, provides counsel to a person who wishes to make a journey of faith and discovery of God's will in his life. The spiritual guide aims to discern, understand what the Holy Spirit, through the situations of life, spiritual insights fruit of prayer, reading and meditation on the Bible, tells the person accompanied. The spiritual father or spiritual director may provide advice, give indications of life and prayer, resolving doubts in matters of faith and morals without replacing the choices and decisions to the person accompanying.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
Eastern Orthodoxy comes from the same pre-schism traditions, but the role of a "spiritual director" or "elder" in Orthodoxy has maintained its important role.  The original Greek term geron (meaning "elder", as in gerontology) was rendered by the Russian word [[starets]], from Old Church Slavonic starĭtsĭ, "elder", derived from starŭ, "old". The Greek tradition has a long unbroken history of elders and disciples, such as [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] and [[John Moschos]] in the seventh century, [[Symeon the Studite|Symeon the Elder]] and [[Symeon the New Theologian]] in the eleventh century, and contemporary charismatic gerontes such as [[Porphyrios (Bairaktaris) of Kafsokalivia|Porphyrios]] and [[Paisios (Eznepidis)|Paisios]]. [[Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[Nil Sorsky]] were two most venerated startsy of Old [[Muscovy]]. The revival of elders in the Slavic world is associated with the name of [[Paisius Velichkovsky]] (1722–94), who produced the Russian translation of the [[Philokalia]]. The most famous Russian starets of the early 19th century was [[Seraphim of Sarov]] (1759-1833), who went on to become one of the most revered Orthodox saints.
The [[Optina Pustyn]] near [[Kozelsk]] used to be celebrated for its startsy (Schema-Archimandrite Moses, Schema-Hegumen Anthony, Hieroschemamonk Leonid, Hieroschemamonk Macarius, Hieroschemamonk Hilarion, Hieroschemamonk Ambrose, Hieroschemamonk Anatole (Zertsalov)).[1] Such writers as [[Nikolay Gogol]], [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Konstantin Leontyev]] sought advice from the elders of this monastery. They also inspired the figure of Zosima in Dostoyevsky's novel [[The Brothers Karamazov]]. A more modern example of a starets is Archimandrite [[John Krestiankin]] (1910-2006) of the [[Pskov Monastery of the Caves]] who was popularly recognized as such by many [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] living in [[Russia]].

=== Judaism ===
In [[Judaism]], the Hebrew term for spiritual director differs among traditional communities. The verb ''Hashpa'ah'' is common in some communities though not all; the spiritual director called a ''mashpi'a'' occurs in the [[Habad]]-Lubavitch community and also in the [[Jewish Renewal]] community. A  ''mashgiakh ruchani'' is the equivalent role among [[mitnagedim]] (adherents of the ''[[Musar movement|mussar]]'' tradition). The purpose of hashpa'ah is to support the directee in her or his personal relationship with God, and to deepen that person's ability to find God's presence in ordinary life. Amongst [[Lubavitchers]] this draws on the literature and praxis of [[Hasidism]] as it is practiced according to Habad standards, and to Jewish mystical tradition generally. Spiritual mentorship is customary in the Hasidic world, but not necessarily in the same way.

=== Sufism ===
In [[Sufism]], the term used for spiritual master is ''[[murshid]]'', Arabic for "guide" or "teacher". He is more than a spiritual director and believed to be guiding the disciples based on his direct connectivity with the Divine. The murshid's role is to spiritually guide and verbally instruct the disciple on the Sufi path after the disciple takes an oath of allegiance or [[Bay'ah]] (''bai'ath'') with him. The concept of Murshid Kamil Akmal (also known as Insan-e-Kamil) is significant in most [[tariqa]]s. The doctrine states that from pre-existence till pre-eternity, there shall always remain a [[Qutb]] or a Universal Man upon the earth who would be the perfect manifestation of God and at the footsteps of the Islamic prophet [[Mohammad]].&lt;ref name="Murshid Kamil Akmal (Perfect Spiritual Guide)"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sult̤ān Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman|title=Perfect Spiritual Guide (Murshid-e-Kamil Akmal) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVxlAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=murshid+kamil+akmal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=murshid%20kamil%20akmal&amp;f=false|publisher=Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
