'''10+2''' refers to the 2 years of schooling required post grade 10, currently adopted by high schools in India and Nepal. It is similar to the [[K–12 (education)|K12]] education system, and equivalent to the [[International Baccalaureate]] and [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] levels in the west. 10+2 refers to two years of schooling post grade 10 in India since autumn 2002. 

10+2 is gradually replacing the conventional modes of [[Primary education|intermediate education]], being the Intermediate of Science (I. Sc.), Intermediate of Commerce (I. Comm.), Intermediate of Arts/Humanities (I. A.) normally taken by Students after having received their School Leaving Certificate (SLC) provided by [[Tribhuvan University]].

Students in Nepal either opt for a 10+2 course in the Science, Management, and Humanities stream under the Higher Secondary Education Board (HSEB), or opt for other options like the British GCSE curriculum under [[Cambridge University]].

[[A.S. Neill]]'s '''''A Dominie's Log''''' is a diary of his first year as headteacher at Gretna Green Village School, during 1914-15. It is an autobiographical novel.&lt;ref&gt;Croall, Jonathan (1983b). Neill of Summerhill: The Permanent Rebel. New York: Pantheon Books. {{ISBN|978-0-394-51403-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He changed a hard working, academic school controlled by corporal punishment and the fear of the authority of the teacher into one of happiness, play and children controlling their learning.&lt;ref&gt;Neill, A. S., A Dominie's Log,  Herbert Jenkins Limited, London, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; He was a reflective teacher, sitting on his desk thinking out why he and the children were at the school. He also, most importantly, thought the children were human beings, and engaged with them as such, joining in their games, sliding with them on an ice slide in the street, sharing their sweets, laughing with them, and appreciating and respecting their individuality, and creativity.

== Celebrating the practising teacher ==

Most images of teachers are about the individual as hero overcoming the problems of school and parents and leading the children to enlightenment. Like the heroes of fairy tales they do not challenge or change the system, they are simply heroes of the system,&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, Jack, Breaking the Magic Spell: Radical Theories of Folk and Fairy Tales, The University Press of Kentucky; 2nd Revised edition, 1 Jul 2002, {{ISBN|978-0813190303}}&lt;/ref&gt; if only all teachers were like them. To Neill the children, and their school and local community, are the heroes, they are the ones that he sees as helping the child to be happy, healthy and free. In the first review it states that he has opinions on everything, but that was to miss the point, that the issues of the school and its children impinge on political and cultural life, they are not separate. Neill is thinking of the culture of childhood and schooling, not of the school as a place for effective, efficient methods and positive measurable outcomes. The story is about him trying to 'create an attitude'. Indeed, after ten years of teaching, in 1921 he creates a school, a community, that is the hero, Summerhill School. Its formation is portrayed in ''A Dominie Abroad'', and the Children's BBC producer, Jon East, uses it to get audiences to question what a school is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3670605/Summerhill-The-school-where-lessons-are-optional.html|title=Summerhill: The school where lessons are optional|author=James Rampton|date=19 January 2008|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his drama about the school and its fight with Ofsted inspectors, ''Summerhill''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/22205368|title=SUMMERHILL (ep1)|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"An awful lot of drama is set in schools - and yet each series only reinforces the dominant paradigm," Jon East says. "What we're trying to say in this drama is that there could just be another way of doing things."&lt;ref&gt;Rampton, James, ''Summerhill: The school where lessons are optional', The Telegraph, 19 Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Neill reads the war news everyday to discuss with the children. He uses Ibsen's play ''An Enemy of the People'', replacing that day's bible lesson, to question the justice of democracy when the mob rules. This book, the way it is written, the way he thinks through issues, the way it ends, can be seen as representing all those teachers who at that time helped create the community known as New Ideals in Education Conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman|first= Michael |year=2015|title= Children’s Rights in our Schools –  the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937|url=https://www.academia.edu/14081708/Regaining_the_History_of_Childrens_Rights_in_Schools_Through_the_New_Ideals_in_Education_Conferences_1914-37 |website=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed in the foundation value for all schools and children's communities, of 'liberating the child from the authority of the teacher'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/New-Ideals-in-Education-Conferences-386690128169894/|title=Security Check Required|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basing schools on children's rights ==

It was recognised by the New Ideal's teachers, professors, soldiers, politicians, headteachers, artists, musicians, actors... that the liberty of the child, the autonomy of the learner, their creativity, self-expression, their search for knowledge and learning was the hope for a world of justice and peace.

"In the first place, this amazing Conference at which we have seen sitting side by side Government Officials, advanced Montessorians, antediluvian Teachers like myself, University Professors, Soldiers in khaki, Musicians, Artists, Headmasters of Public Schools, the superintendent of the Little Commonwealth, Primary Schoolteachers, and the American Ambassador himself stands, first and foremost, for Freedom, - I do not like "emancipation", for the word suggests slavery, and the use of it probably promotes it. We have all agreed that the child is to be free: yes, but the teacher must be free as well as the child…"—Mr Lionel Helbert, Headmaster of West Downs, Winchester, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;New Ideals Committee, Report of the Conference on New Ideals in Education August 14–21, 1915, p122, Women's Print Society, 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

Neill in ''A Dominie's Log'' writes about the children's ice slide being salted by the policeman to protect the property of the farmers, their horses. He reflects with the children that they have no voice because they have no vote, he compares them to women, and women's low pay and menial jobs. He suggests they write a charter of children's rights. As through the whole book he does not do what teachers so often do now, turn things into projects, getting the kids to role play a campaign or draw cartoons of their plans for play in the town and its streets, but to look at the issue in terms of power, and how to get equality!

== Need for a culture and shared history of children's rights ==
For all rights movements to succeed they build on their history, on changes their struggles have caused, and just as importantly on the culture of struggle they have created. This empowers them to feel a part of a movement, a successful, heroic struggle, with numerous examples of small successes that help to build the momentum for sustained change in laws and attitudes. Children and teachers need to feel they are a part of an historical struggle for the rights of the child. A Dominie's Log is one personal story of a headteacher, it is representative of a whole movement, New Ideals, and it is vital that we celebrate and share this history, so that it effects the present.

Evidence has been submitted to the Select Committee on Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/education-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/childrens-commissioner-england-15-16/|title=The Children's Commissioner for England|work=UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their meeting with the Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield OBE, to discuss her new report 'Ambitious for Children'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Ambitious_For_Children_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (August 2015). It is trying to input into the discussion of the voice of the child, and their future society and culture, the importance of this history.

== Reviewed in November 1915 ==
On Friday 5 November 1915 ''The Yorkshire Post'' in its far right column on page 3, under the title "New Books Received Yesterday" lists 14 books ranging from ''Nurse Cavell, the Story of her Life and Martyrdom'' to ''Toy Making at Home'' and ''Morals for the Young''. The fourth book on the list, after ''Furniture Collector'', is ''A Dominie’s Log'' by A.S.Neill, MA.&lt;ref&gt;The Yorkshire Post, 5 November 1915, p3&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest reviews is in the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'', Monday 15 November 1915:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4CZ4r2BjJmDMlRway14eDMzdkE/view?usp=sharing|title=The Edinburgh Evening News Dominies Log Review.pdf|work=Google Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A ''Dominie's Log'', by Mr A. S. Neill, MA, introduces a new Scottish humorist of a very entertaining type. It is not the anecdotage of a superannuated wielder of the tawse, but the diary of an up-to-date young man of moods and ideas, with the gift of giving these pointed expression. Mr Neill is not enamoured of the present educational system, and in its short-comings he finds ample scope for the exercise of trenchant criticism and pungent wit. He has "a great work" with his bairns, who under his regime have a joyous time, for their teacher is "much more interested in humanity than materials." His go-as-you-please scheme would hardly lend itself to general application, but having surveyed the happy picture Mr Neill sketches, "More’s the pity." The author however, does not confine his random reflections to matters educational. He has views on most things under the sun, and these are well worth adding to the general stock of wisdom and humour. If, as in his blue moods he seems tempted to do, Mr Neill forsakes the scholastic profession, one may hope that he will give us more of these diverting chronicles. The book is published by Messrs Herbert Jenkins, Ltd., London, at 2s 6d.&lt;ref&gt;The Edinburgh Evening News, 15 November 1915, p4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Centenary ==
To celebrate the centenary of A.S. Neill’s first book one hundred copies of a special edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dominieslog.co.uk/|title=A Dominie's Log|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are being sent to key cultural, creative, educational and political figures during November (the month of its publication). They are all being invited to take part in the centenary celebrations of the book, by contributing to a final centenary edition, and by responding to the book through their creativity or public appearances. A series of events will be held during the year.

“In this centenary of industrial warfare we need to remind people, especially our children, of the culture of success and happiness that this book is a part of, and that we still have a long way to go to have happy schools based on the dignity of our children.”&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Michael, 'A.S. Neill's  A Dominie's Log', Introduction, Futures Publications for A.S. Neills Summerhill Trust, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenging the current failure to learn from history and examples of good practice in our schools, and the obsession of focusing on innovation, measurement and outcomes, the book reminds us that schools at the beginning of World War One were better than schools now. It reminds us of the concept of the good primary school being child-centred, based on creative learning, play, learning by doing, group work, learning from the natural world, making decisions and taking responsibility for their learning and their community. We must claim these back as the foundations of our schools.

'''Autodidacticism''' (also '''autodidactism''') or '''self-education''' (also '''self-learning''' and '''self-teaching''') is [[education]] without the guidance of masters  (such as [[teacher]]s and [[professor]]s) or [[educational institution|institutions]] (such as schools). Generally, an autodidact is an individual who chooses the subject they will study, their studying material, and the studying rhythm and time. An autodidact may or may not have [[formal education]], and their study may be either a complement or an alternative to it. Many [[List of notable autodidacts|notable contributions]] have been made by autodidacts.

== Etymology ==
The term has its roots in the [[Ancient Greek]] words {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αὐτός|αὐτός]]}} ({{transl|grc|autós}}, {{Literal translation|'self'|lk=on}}) and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:διδακτικός|διδακτικός]]}} ({{transl|grc|didaktikos}}, {{Literal translation|'teaching'}}). The related term ''[[didacticism]]'' defines an artistic [[philosophy of education]].

== Terminology ==
Various terms are used to describe self-education. One such is ''heutagogy'', coined in 2000 by Stewart Hase and Chris Kenyon of [[Southern Cross University]] in Australia; others are ''self-directed learning'' and ''self-determined learning''. In the heutagogy paradigm, a learner should be at the centre of their own learning.&lt;ref name= ChapnickMeloy&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance elearning: creating dramatic and unconventional learning experiences|series=Essential resources for training and HR professionals|author1=Samantha Chapnick  |author2=Jimm Meloy |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|date=2005|isbn=9780787971472|pages=36&amp;ndash;37|chapter=From Andragogy to Heutagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern education==
Autodidacticism is sometimes a complement of modern education.&lt;ref&gt;"University lecturers do not guide their students' learning to the same extent; they do not organise their students' private study (no more set homework!); nor do they filter knowledge for you in the same way. There are two reasons for this. The first reason is that you are expected to be independent, capable of organising your life, your time, your studies and your learning, so that when you graduate you are able to function successfully in your chosen profession". Extract from: ''The student's guide to learning at university'', by Geoffrey Cooper, published in 2003 Australia by TheHumanities.com, {{ISBN|1-86335-510-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a complement to education, students would be encouraged to do more independent work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=3459 |title=Natural Learning in Higher Education |author=J. Scott Armstrong |journal=Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning |year=2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028075300/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public%3Amain.file&amp;fileID=3459 |archivedate=28 October 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a new situation for self-directed learners.

Before the twentieth century, only a small minority of people received an advanced academic education. As stated by [[Joseph Whitworth]] in his influential report on industry dated from 1853, literacy rates were higher in the United States. However, even in the U.S., most children were not completing high school. High school education was necessary to become a teacher. In modern times, a larger percentage of those completing high school also attended college, usually to pursue a professional degree, such as law or medicine, or a divinity degree.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"/&gt;

For many professions or for personal knowledge, however, formal education is not so necessary today due to the easier availability of free information on the Internet. Whereas in the past, one of the main benefits of going to college was to gain access to their superior libraries, today access to facts and books is available online. Financial analyst and author [[Peter Schiff]], for one, says, "Never before in history has it been so easy to be self-educated".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT3wmLjPAQ0&amp;t=27m27s Radio interview with Peter Schiff], 9 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Collegiate teaching was based on the classics (Latin, philosophy, ancient history, theology) until the early nineteenth century. There were few if any institutions of higher learning offering studies in engineering or science before 1800. Institutions such as the [[Royal Society]] did much to promote scientific learning, including public lectures. In England, there were also itinerant lecturers offering their service, typically for a fee.&lt;ref name="Robinson and Musson"&gt;{{cite book

Prior to the nineteenth century, there were many important inventors working as millwrights or mechanics who had typically received an elementary education and served an apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanics, instrument makers and surveyors had various mathematics training. [[James Watt]] was a surveyor and instrument maker and is described as being "largely self-educated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watt, like some other autodidacts of the time, became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and a member of the [[Lunar Society]]. In the eighteenth century these societies often gave public lectures and were instrumental in teaching chemistry and other sciences with industrial applications which were neglected by traditional universities. Academies also arose to provide scientific and technical training.

Years of schooling in the United States began to increase sharply in the early twentieth century. This phenomenon was seemingly related to increasing mechanization displacing child labor. The automated glass bottle-making machine is said to have done more for education than child labor laws because boys were no longer needed to assist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of boys employed in this particular industry was not that large; it was mechanization in several sectors of industry that displaced child labor toward education. For males in the U.S. born 1886–90, years of school averaged 7.86, while for those born in 1926–30, years of school averaged 11.46.&lt;ref&gt;[http://129.3.20.41/eps/mac/papers/0502/0502021.pdf Two Centuries of American Macroeconomic Growth From Exploration of Resource Abundance to Knowledge Driven Development, pp 44] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723192618/http://129.3.20.41/eps/mac/papers/0502/0502021.pdf |date=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most recent trends in education is that the classroom environment should cater towards students' individual needs, goals, and interests. This model adopts the idea of [[inquiry-based learning]] where students are presented with scenarios to identify their own research, questions and knowledge regarding the area. As a form of [[discovery learning]], students in today's classrooms are being provided with more opportunity to "experience and interact" with knowledge, which has its roots in autodidacticism.

Successful self-teaching requires self-discipline and reflective capability. Some research suggests that being able to regulate one's own learning is something that must be modeled to students, for it is not a natural human tendency in the population at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iran-Nejad|first=Asghar|author2=Brad Chissom|title=Contributions of Active and Dynamic Self-Regulation to Learning|journal=Innovative Higher Education|year=1992|volume=17|issue=2|page=125|doi=10.1007/bf00917134}}&lt;/ref&gt; To interact with the environment, a framework has been identified to determine the components of any learning system: a reward function, incremental action value functions and action selection methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arentze|first=Theo|author2=Harry Timmermans|title=Modeling learning and adaptation processes in activity-travel choice: A framework and numerical experiment|journal=Transportation|year=2003|volume=30|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewards work best in motivating learning when they are specifically chosen on an individual student basis. New knowledge must be incorporated into previously existing information as its value is to be assessed. Ultimately, these [[instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]] techniques, as described by [[Vygotsky]] (1978) and problem solving methods are a result of dynamic decision making.

The secular and modern societies gave foundations for a new system of education and a new kind of autodidacts. While the number of schools and students raised from one century to the other, so did the number of autodidacts. The industrial revolution produced new educational tools used in schools, universities and outside academic circles to create a post-modern era that gave birth to the World Wide Web and encyclopaedic data banks such as [[Wikipedia]]. As this concept becomes more widespread and popular, web locations like [[Udacity]] and [[Khan Academy]] are developed as learning centers for many people to actively and freely learn together. The [[Alliance for Self-Directed Education]] (ASDE) is also formed to publicize and provide guidance or support for self-directed education.

==In history, philosophy, literature, and television==
{{No footnotes|section|date=February 2012}}
The first philosophical claim supporting an autodidactic program to the study of nature and God was in the philosophical novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (Alive Son of the Vigilant), whose titular hero is considered the archetypal autodidact.&lt;ref name="ben-zaken"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is a medieval autodidactic utopia, a philosophical treatise in a literary form, which was written by the Andalusian philosopher [[Ibn Tufail]] in the 1160s in Marrakesh. It is a story about a feral boy, an autodidact prodigy who masters nature through instruments and reason, discovers laws of nature by practical exploration and experiments, and gains ''[[summum bonum]]'' through a mystical mediation and communion with God. The hero rises from his initial state of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' to a mystical or direct experience of God after passing through the necessary natural experiences. The focal point of the story is that human reason, unaided by society and its conventions or by religion, can achieve scientific knowledge, preparing the way to the mystical or highest form of human knowledge.

Commonly translated as "The Self-Taught Philosopher" or "The Improvement of Human Reason", Ibn-Tufayl's story Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan inspired debates about autodidacticism in a range of historical fields from classical Islamic philosophy through Renaissance humanism and the European Enlightenment. In his book ''Reading Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan: a Cross-Cultural History of Autodidacticism,'' Avner Ben-Zaken showed how the text traveled from late medieval Andalusia to early modern Europe and demonstrated the intricate ways in which autodidacticism was contested in and adapted to diverse cultural settings.

&lt;ref name="ben-zaken" /&gt; Autodidacticism apparently intertwined with struggles over Sufism in twelfth-century Marrakesh; controversies about the role of philosophy in pedagogy in fourteenth-century Barcelona; quarrels concerning astrology in Renaissance Florence in which Pico della Mirandola pleads for autodidacticism against the strong authority of intellectual establishment notions of predestination; and debates pertaining to experimentalism in seventeenth-century Oxford. Pleas for autodidacticism echoed not only within close philosophical discussions; they surfaced in struggles for control between individuals and establishments.&lt;ref name="ben-zaken" /&gt;

In the story of African American self-education, Heather Andrea Williams presents a historical account to examine African American's relationship to literacy during [[slavery]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the first decades of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=H.A.|title=Self-taught: African American Education in slavery and freedom|year=2005|publisher=University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the personal accounts tell of individuals who have had to teach themselves due to [[racial discrimination]] in education.

The [[working-class]] protagonist of [[Jack London's]] ''[[Martin Eden]]'' (1909) embarks on a path of self-learning to win the affections of Ruth, a member of cultured society. By the end of the novel, Eden has surpassed the intellect of the bourgeois class, leading him to a state of indifference and ultimately suicide.

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Nausea (Book)|Nausea]]'' (1938) depicts, as a secondary character, an autodidact.

Comic-book superhero [[Batman]] is frequently depicted as an autodidactic polymath who has acquired a vast range of skills over the years either by various trainers or having trained himself, and his expertise in various disciplines is virtually unmatched in the DC comics universe.

In ''[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster]]'' (1987), [[Jacques Rancière]] describes the emancipatory education of [[Joseph Jacotot]], a post-Revolutionary [[philosopher]] of education who discovered that he could teach things he did not know. The book is both a history and a contemporary intervention in the philosophy and politics of education, through the concept of autodidacticism; Rancière chronicles Jacotot's "adventures", but he articulates Jacotot's theory of "emancipation" and "stultification" in the present tense.

The 1997 drama film ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' follows the story of autodidact Will Hunting, played by [[Matt Damon]]. Hunting demonstrates his breadth and depth of knowledge throughout the film but especially to his therapist and in a heated discussion in a [[Harvard]] bar.

One of the main characters in ''[[The Elegance of the Hedgehog]]'' (2006), by [[Muriel Barbery]], is an autodidact. The story is told from the viewpoint of Renee, a middle-aged autodidact concierge in a Paris upscale apartment house and Paloma, a 12-year-old daughter of one of the tenants who is unhappy with her life. These two people find they have much in common when they both befriend a new tenant, Mr. Ozu, and their lives change forever.

In the Hindu epic, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Ekalavya]]'' is depicted as a tribal boy who was denied education in the science of arms from royal teachers from the house of Kuru. Ekalavya went to the forest, where he taught himself archery in front of an image of the Kuru teacher, Drona, that he had built for himself. Later, when the royal family found that Ekalavya had practiced with the image of Drona as his teacher, Drona asked for Ekalavya's thumb as part of his tuition. Ekalavya complied with Drona's request, thus ending his martial career.

In ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]'', the protagonist (Mike Ross) possesses a highly competent knowledge of the law despite not receiving any formal education in any law school. His knowledge is attributable to both his affinity for reading (autodidacticism), in addition to his ''[[eidetic memory]]''.

Dr. Spencer Reid in ''Criminal Minds'', played by Matthew Gray Gubler, is an autodidact with an eidetic memory.

==In architecture==
[[Image:Tadao Ando 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Tadao Ando]] is a famous autodidact architect of the twenty-first century]]
Many successful and influential [[architect]]s, such as [[Mies Van Der Rohe]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Violet-le-Duc|Violet-Le-Duc]], and [[Tadao Ando]] were self-taught.

There are very few countries allowing autodidacticism in [[architecture]] today. The practice of architecture or the use of the title "architect", are now [[Professional requirements for architects|protected in most countries]].

Self-taught architects have generally studied and qualified in other fields such as [[engineering]] or [[handicraft|arts and crafts]]. [[Jean Prouvé]] was first a structural engineer. [[Le Corbusier]] had an academic qualification in decorative arts. [[Tadao Ando]] started his career as a draftsman, and [[Eileen Gray]] studied [[fine arts]].

When a [[political state]] starts to implement restrictions on the profession, there are issues related to the rights of established self-taught architects. In most countries the legislation includes a [[grandfather clause]], authorising established self-taught architects to continue practicing. In the UK, the legislation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaruk.info/Legislation/Act31.PDF Architects (Registration) Act 1931] (UK)&lt;/ref&gt; allowed self-trained architects with 2 years of experience to register. In France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=606CAD25CBEA6D17169D0D5D82D5C464.tpdjo14v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000522423&amp;dateTexte=19770104&amp;categorieLien=id#JORFTEXT000000522423 Loi n°77-2 du 3 janvier 1977 sur l'architecture] (Architects Act in France)&lt;/ref&gt; it allowed self-trained architects with 5 years of experience to register. In Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordredesarchitectes.be/fr/textes/juridique/loi_du_20_fevrier_1939.htm Loi du 20 fevrier 1939] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226220737/http://www.ordredesarchitectes.be/fr/textes/juridique/loi_du_20_fevrier_1939.htm |date=26 December 2010 }} (Architects Act in Belgium)&lt;/ref&gt; the law allowed experienced self-trained architects in practice to register. In Italy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordinearchitetti.fi.it/writable/Documenti/Conoscere%20l'ordine/A3/COMPETENZE/A3_1-12%20RD%2024-06-1923%20n.1395.pdf legge 24 june 1923 No. 1395] (Architects Act in Italy)&lt;/ref&gt; it allowed self-trained architects with 10 years of experience to register. In The Netherlands, the "''wet op de architectentitel van 7 juli 1987''" along with additional procedures, allowed architects with 10 years of experience and architects aged 40 years old or over, with 5 years of experience, to access the register.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to document on the Dutch Registration System drafted after a meeting between the General Secretary and Dr. Hans Groenevald, Director of the Stichting Bureau Architectenreglster, (SBA) in the Hague on 1 October 1993. 1 October 1993 is a significant date because on that day the protection of the title "architect" came into force in the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other [[sovereign states]] chose to omit such a clause, and many established and competent practitioners were stripped of their professional rights.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the example of the Republic of Ireland, where hundreds of professionally trained architects oppose new legislation that would prevent them from practicing. See [https://www.webcitation.org/5xRi740Mn?url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENJ/2010/05/18/00005.asp Parliamentary records] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic of Ireland, a group named "[[Architects' Alliance of Ireland]]" is defending the interests of long-established self-trained architects&lt;ref&gt;You can access more information from [http://www.architectsalliance.ie/ AAoI website]&lt;/ref&gt; who were recently deprived from their rights to practice as per Part 3 of the Irish Building Control Act 2007.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, you can access the full text from the Irish [http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2007/a2107.pdf Building Control Act 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical research such as "''Architecture of Change, Sustainability and Humanity in the Built Environment''"&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture of Change, Sustainability and Humanity in the Built Environment'', Editors: Kristin Feireiss, Lukas Feireiss, {{ISBN|978-3-89955-211-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or older studies like "[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une Architecture]]" from [[Le Corbusier]] describe the practice of architecture as an environment changing with new technologies, sciences, and legislation. All architects must be autodidacts to keep up to date with new [[Technical standard|standards]],  [[regulations]], or [[Methodology|methods]].

Self-taught architects like [[Eileen Gray]], [[Luis Barragán]], and many others, created a system where working is also learning, where self-education is associated with creativity and productivity within a working environment.

While he was primarily interested in [[naval architecture]], [[William Francis Gibbs]] learned his profession through his own study of [[battleship]]s and [[ocean liner]]s. Through his life he could be seen examining and changing the designs of ships that were already built, that is, until he started his firm [[Gibbs and Cox]].

==Future role==
The role of self-directed learning continues to be investigated in learning approaches, along with other important goals of education, such as content knowledge, epistemic practices and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hmelo-Silver|first=C.E. |author2=R.G. Duncan |author3=C.A Chinn|title=Scaffolding and achievement in problem-based and inquiry learning: A response to Krischner, Sweller and Clark|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=2007|volume=42|issue=2|page=99|doi=10.1080/00461520701263368}}&lt;/ref&gt; As colleges and universities offer [[distance learning]] degree programs and secondary schools provide [[cyber school]] options for K-12 students, technology provides numerous resources that enable individuals to have a self-directed learning experience. Several studies show these programs function most effectively when the "teacher" or facilitator is a full owner of virtual space to encourage a broad range of experiences to come together in an online format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barab|first=S.A. |author2=J.G. MaKinster |author3=J.A. Moore |author4=D.J. Cunningham|title=Designing and Building an online-community: The struggle to support sociability in the inquiry learning forum|journal=Educational Technology Research and Development|year=2001|volume=49|issue=4|page=71|doi=10.1007/bf02504948}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows self-directed learning to encompass both a chosen path of information inquiry, self-regulation methods and reflective discussion among experts as well as novices in a given area. Furthermore, [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs) make autodidacticism easier and thus more common.

A 2016 [[Stack Overflow]] poll&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016 | title=Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2016 | accessdate=Nov 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that due to the rise of autodidacticism, 69.1% of [[software developer]]s appear to be self-taught.

The '''Bantu Education Act, 1953''' (Act No. 47 of 1953; later renamed the '''Black Education Act, 1953''') was a [[South Africa]]n segregation law which legalised several aspects of the [[apartheid]] system passed by the Apartheid regime which was really not on the side of the black community. Its major provision was enforcing racially separated educational facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/53445/Moore_Class_2016.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=IN CLASS OF THEIR OWN: THE BANTU EDUCATION ACT (1953) REVISITED|last=Nadine L.

Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Clark | first = Nancy L. | authorlink = |author2=Worger, William H. | title = South Africa - The Rise and Fall of Apartheid |series = Seminar Studies in History| publisher = Pearson Education Limited | year = 2004 | location = | pages = 48–52 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6JTRPzhoH4cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=0582414377#PPP1,M1| doi = | id = | isbn = 0-582-41437-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, this type of education was extended to "non white" universities and colleges with the [[Extension of University Education Act]], and the internationally prestigious [[Fort Hare University|University College of Fort Hare]] was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufh.ac.za/timeline.html# Timeline of the University: 1959]  n{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230083858/http://www.ufh.ac.za/timeline.html%23 |date=December 30, 2007 }}. Official website of University of Fort Hare. Accessed 2007-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often argued that the policy of Bantu (African) education was aimed to direct black or non-white youth to the unskilled labour market,&lt;ref name="byrnes" /&gt; although Kiyaam Govind, at the time Minister of Native Affairs, claimed that the aim was to solve South Africa's "ethnic problems" by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic group.

The [[National Party (South Africa)|national authorities of the time]] is often said to have viewed education as having a rather pivotal position in their goal of eventually separating South Africa from the Bantustans entirely. The Minister of Native Affairs at the time, the "Architect of Apartheid" [[Hendrik Verwoerd]], stated that:&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is no place for [the Bantu] in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour ... What is the use of teaching the Bantu child mathematics when it cannot use it in practice?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The introduction of Bantu Education led to a substantial increase of government funding to the learning institutions of black Africans, but it did not keep up with population increase.&lt;ref name="giliomee"&gt;Giliomee H, 2009. ''A Note on Bantu Education 1953-1970'' South African Journal of Economics, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The law forced institutions under the direct control of the state and solve white man problems. The National Party now had the power to employ and train teachers as they saw fit. Black teachers' salaries in 1953 were extremely low and resulted in a dramatic drop of trainee teachers. Only one third of the black teachers were qualified.&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt;

The schools reserved for the country's white children were of Western standards. 30% of the black schools did not have electricity, 25% no running water and less than half had plumbing. The education for Blacks, Indians and Coloureds was substantially cheaper but not free.&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt; In the 70s, the per capita governmental spending on black education was one-tenth of the spending on white.&lt;ref name="byrnes"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Byrnes | first = Rita M. | authorlink =  | title = South Africa: A Country Study | publisher = GPO for the Library of Congress | year = 1996 | location = Washington | pages = | url = http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/ | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the ''Afrikaans Medium Decree'' of 1974, which forced all black schools to use both [[Afrikaans]] and English as languages of instruction beginning with the last year of primary school, led to the [[Soweto Uprising]] in which more than 575 people died, at least 134 of them under the age of eighteen.&lt;ref name="byrnes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/library/bl/blsaJune16decree.htm|title=The Afrikaans Medium Decree that Led to the Soweto Uprising|website=about.com|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act was repealed in 1979 by the [[Education and Training Act, 1979]], which continued the system of racially segregated education, while also eliminating both discrimination in tuition fees and the segregated Department of Bantu Education and allowing the both use of native tongue education up to the fourth grade and limited attendance at private schools as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sq43lnbklEUC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=1979+south+african+education+and+training+act&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=arS1e7r4pN&amp;sig=QaEHHY_aOnRgIh7PgdlxkENlhGQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-_bfyqc_UAhVL54MKHT8KAmUQ6AEIRzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=1979+south+african+education+and+training+act&amp;f=false|title=South Africa: Time Running Out : the Report of the Study Commission on U.S. Policy Toward Southern Africa|first=Study Commission on U.

[[File:College of Creative Studies, UCSB.jpg|thumb|250px|The front of the College of Creative Studies]]

The '''College of Creative Studies''' is the smallest of the three [[undergraduate]] colleges at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], unique within the University of California system in terms of structure and philosophy.&lt;ref name='dnccslife'&gt;{{Cite news |last=Golay |first=Annie |date=May 18, 2016 |title=Students Talk Life in UCSB’s Smallest College |url=http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-talk-life-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/ |newspaper=[[Daily Nexus]] |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its small size, student privileges, and grading system are designed to encourage self-motivated students with strong interests in a field to accomplish original work as undergraduates. A former student has called it a “[[graduate school]] for undergraduates”. The college has roughly 350 students in eight [[Academic major|majors]] and approximately 60 professors and lecturers.&lt;ref name='dnccslife'/&gt; There is an additional application process to the standard UCSB admission for prospective CCS students, and CCS accepts applications for admissions throughout the year.

== History ==
In the late 1960s, the [[Chancellor]] of UCSB, Vernon I. Cheadle, was looking for an [[alternative education]] program for undergraduate students which could embody the new thinking of the 60s and also attract attention to his growing university. He contacted a professor in the [[English literature|English]] department, [[Marvin Mudrick]], to come up with ideas for this new program. In 1967 the University of California allowed funding for Mudrick to start up the most promising of those ideas, the College of Creative Studies.

The program started with approximately 50 students in 7 majors: [[Art]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]], [[Music Composition]], [[Literature]] and [[Physics]]. The [[experiment]]al program struck a chord with its students and faculty, and along with the powerful pushing of Mudrick as its [[Provost (education)|provost]], it secured its place at UCSB. The program grew over the years in student and faculty size and in 1975 found its home in a building at UCSB that dates from when the campus was a [[World War II]] [[Marine corps|marine]] base. In 1995 the college added the major of [[Computer Science]]. In 2005, with the retirement of Provost William Ashby, the title of the Provost was changed to [[Dean (education)|Dean]] and the College was placed under the leadership of Dr. [[Bruce Tiffney]].

The Art department includes the only undergraduate [[Artist's books|book arts]] program in the University of California system. Recently, the Physics program has become regarded as one of the best undergraduate Physics programs in the nation; its students attend graduate schools with percentages resembling those of [[Ivy League]]s. CCS students have won the UCSB Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research several times in recent years. Literature students run ''Spectrum'', a literary magazine, and ''Into the Teeth of the Wind'', a poetry review.

== Philosophy ==

The [[philosophy]] of the College of Creative Studies is that certain undergraduate students are capable of rigorously exploring and adding to their chosen field of knowledge. Students skip introductory courses as appropriate and are encouraged to accomplish original work throughout their time at the College: Literature students compile a portfolio of writing, art students put on a minimum of two shows displaying their work, music students perform their own compositions, and science students enter labs by their [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] years to conduct research and write scholarly papers for publication.

The College considers students to be the most important people involved, not the faculty or administration. It has a low student-teacher ratio, and each student is paired with a faculty adviser with whom they meet at least once a [[Quarter (academic)|quarter]].

== Privileges and grading system ==

CCS students have few [[general education requirements]] and may take almost any course in the entire university, including graduate classes, without being required to complete the prerequisites. They can drop classes up to the last day of instruction in the quarter, a privilege intended to encourage students to attempt taking many units and advanced classes without being penalized in the case that they bit off more than they could chew.

In CCS classes, students do not receive letter grades. Instead, the College uses a sliding [[Credit (education)|unit]] scale where if a student completes all the work for a class at a satisfactory level, the student receives a full 4 units for most classes. If the student completes less work, he/she would receive fewer units, and if the student goes beyond expectations, a professor may give student more units. This system aims to promote a non-competitive atmosphere that focuses more on the student learning the material rather than learning how to take a test.

CCS students are afforded many privileges to help in the pursuit of their education. 

*Fewer prerequisites: If a CCS student can show a capability of taking an upper division or graduate class, even without the prerequisites, the college greatly facilitates the process of getting the student in that class.
*Drop class and change grading: CCS students may drop any class up until the last day of instruction. This privilege is given as a backup if a student happens to try taking advanced classes or more classes than the usual student. They may also change their grading between letter grade or pass/no-pass for classes outside CCS.&lt;ref name="ccs.ucsb.edu"&gt;[http://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/handbook/registration/ Registration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516220247/http://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/handbook/registration/ |date=2008-05-16 }}, College of Creative Studies&lt;/ref&gt;
*Priority registration: CCS students are among the first students at UCSB to sign up for classes each quarter. They sign up at the same time as [[honors student]]s and [[Sportsperson|athletes]].
*Higher unit cap: CCS students have a unit cap of 95.5 units per quarter. However, most students take between 15 and 25 units a quarter.&lt;ref name="ccs.ucsb.edu"/&gt;
*Building access: All CCS students receive a key to the CCS building and have 24-hour access to it.
*Computer Lab: CCS students have 24-hour access to their own computer lab where they have free [[Internet]] access, [[Computer printer|printing]] and [[photocopying]].
*[[Library]] checkout: CCS students get quarter-long check-out from the UCSB library and may renew materials up to five times.

== The building ==
[[File:Old Little Theatre, UCSB.jpg|thumb|250px|Old Little Theatre]]
The College of Creative Studies is housed in its own single story building, number 494, located between campus [[dorms]], a dining commons, and the University Center. The building was built during World War II and shares the title as the oldest building at UCSB with the other buildings left from when the campus was a marine base.

The building contains classrooms, art studios, faculty and administrative offices, an art gallery, computer labs, print and wood shops and a small 100 person theater. For most of its life it was painted brown, but in early 2005 the administrative offices were painted yellow, the college proper was painted green and the Old Little Theatre was painted red.

The building acts as a "home base" for its students, who spend time in the building studying and socializing. Students are allowed to personalize the building, so the walls have stickers and art, classrooms contain couches and modified desks and there are a few roaming stuffed animals.

Although many students and staff members are fond of the building, the college has outgrown it and is looking for funds to renovate it and/or build new facilities.

== Notable alumni and faculty ==

CCS alumni include:

* Art: [[Mary Heebner]], [[Peggy Oki]], [[Halsey Rodman]], [[Macduff Everton]]

}}'''Community education''', also known as '''community-based education''' or '''community learning &amp; development''', is an organization's programs to promote learning and social development work with individuals and groups in their communities using a range of formal and informal methods. A common defining feature is that programmes and activities are developed in dialogue with communities and participants. The purpose of community learning and development is to develop the capacity of individuals and groups of all ages through their actions, the capacity of communities, to improve their quality of life. Central to this is their ability to participate in democratic processes.&lt;ref name="workingtogether"&gt;Working and Learning Together to Build Stronger Communities, Scottish Government Guidance for Community Learning and Development, 2004 seen at the[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Life-Long-Learning/LearningConnections Community Learning and Development], Scottish Government Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Community education encompasses all those occupations and approaches that are concerned with running education and development programmes within local communities, rather than within educational institutions such as schools, colleges and universities. The latter is known as the formal education system, whereas community education is sometimes called informal education. It has long been critical of aspects of the formal education system for failing large sections of the population in all countries and had a particular concern for taking learning and development opportunities out to poorer areas, although it can be provided more more broadly.

There are a myriad of job titles and employers include public authorities and voluntary or non-governmental organisations, funded by the state and by independent grant making bodies. Schools, colleges and universities may also support community learning and development through outreach work within communities. The community schools movement has been a strong proponent of this since the sixties. Some universities and colleges have run outreach adult education programmes within local communities for decades. Since the seventies the prefix word ‘community’ has also been adopted by several other occupations from youth workers and health workers to planners and architects, who work with more disadvantaged groups and communities and have been influenced by community education and community development approaches.

Community educators have over many years developed a range of skills and approaches for working within local communities and in particular with disadvantaged people. These include less formal educational methods, community organising and group work skills. Since the nineteen sixties and seventies through the various anti poverty programmes in both developed and developing countries, practitioners have been influenced by structural analyses as to the causes of disadvantage and poverty i.e. inequalities in the distribution of wealth, income, land etc. and especially political power and the need to mobilise people power to effect social change. Thus the influence of such educators as Paulo Friere and his focus upon this work also being about politicising the poor.

In the history of community education and community learning and development, the UK has played a significant role in hosting the two main international bodies representing community education and community development. These being the International Community Education Association, which was for many years based at the Community Education Development Centre based in Coventry UK. ICEA and CEDC have now closed, and the International Association for Community Development, which still has its HQ in Scotland. In the 1990s there was some thought as to whether these two bodies might merge. The term community learning and development has not taken off widely in other countries. Although community learning and development approaches are recognised internationally. These methods and approaches have been acknowledged as significant for local social, economic, cultural, environmental and political development by such organisations as the [[UN]], [[WHO]], [[OECD]], [[World Bank]], [[Council of Europe]] and EU.

==In the UK==

In the UK the term community learning and development has now been widely adopted as describing a discrete employment sector of occupations concerned with outreach education and development work in local communities. In 1999 a UK wide organisation responsible for setting professional training standards for education and development practitioners working within local communities  was established. This organisation was called PAULO – the National Training Organisation for Community Learning and Development. (It was named after Paulo Freire.) It was formally recognised by David Blunket, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment in the New Labour Government in January 1999. It brought together a range of occupational interests under a single national training standards body, these being, adult education, youth work, community development and development education. The inclusion of community development was significant as it was initially uncertain as to whether it would join the NTO for Social Care.

The Community Learning and Development NTO represented all the main employers, trades unions, professional associations and national development agencies working in this area across the four nations of the UK. This was the first time that the informal education occupations across the UK had ever come together with the common purpose of creating a publicly recognised occupational sector, in the way that school teachers or college lecturers had long been publicly and officially recognised.

The term 'community learning and development' was adopted to acknowledge that all of these occupations worked primarily within local communities, and that this work encompassed not just providing less formal learning support but also a concern for the wider holistic development of those communities – socio-economically, environmentally, culturally and politically. In effect this brought together for the first time two traditions. The former group of occupations – adult educators, youth workers and community education workers had tended to focus upon the provision of informal education support for individuals and groups within communities. They had always seen their work as being educational. The latter group – community workers, community development workers and development educators had tended to focus upon the socio-economic and environmental development of those communities. Both sets of occupations recognised that they shared very similar values, knowledge base and skill sets and that what brought them together was a common commitment to supporting learning and social action.

By bringing together these occupational groups this created for the first time a single recognised employment sector of nearly 300,000 full and part-time paid staff within the UK, approximately 10% of these staff being full-time. The NTO continued to recognise the range of different occupations within it, for example specialists who work primarily with young people, but all agreed that they shared a core set of professional approaches to their work.

In 2002 the New Labour Government announced that it wished to cluster NTOs, of which there were over 50 covering a wide range of occupations across the UK labour market, under a smaller number of what they called Sector Skills Councils. A Sector Skills Council was formed called the Lifelong Learning UK Sector Skills Council. PAULO became one of five discrete pillars within LLUK, the others being the former NTOs for Further Education, for Universities, for Library and information Services and for Work Based Education. Over nearly a decade LLUK did a large amount of labour market mapping, as well as setting standards for the professional training of people working in the CLD area and generally promoted the identity of this sector across wider UK public policies and the public, non governmental and private sector employers.

All Sector Skills Councils in the UK including LLUK were abolished by the Conservative/Liberal coalition Government in 2011 and at the time of writing it is uncertain as to whether a single body representing the professional community learning and development sector will be sustained. The Community and Youth Workers Union which is part of the Unite Union in the UK played the lead role in improving employee’s conditions across the sector but never succeeded in representing all employees within the CLD sector and is not widely represented across all parts of the UK.

The Scottish Government has continued to recognise community learning and development as a discrete employment sector, and has for over a decade supported CLD training for people wishing to work professionally in this area. There is a team of HMI (Her Majesties Inspectors) to inspect the quality of delivery by employers. In 2007 the Scottish Government established a Scottish Standards Council for Community Learning and Development. This organisation oversees quality standards in the professional training of staff working in this field, including the validation and endorsement of professional training courses and is introducing a professional registration scheme for such qualified practitioners. It has continued much of the work of the former LLUK as it operated in Scotland.

At the present time similar CLD Standards Councils have not been set up in other parts of the UK and it does appear that the sector outside Scotland is once again becoming more fragmented. Unlike the formal education sector there is virtually no legislation in the UK underpinning the need to provide and fund community learning and development. Consequently, it has been vulnerable to cuts in public expenditure due to the recession, particularly projects that were seen as too radical.

== National priorities ==

Three national priorities have been developed for community learning and development in Scotland:

;Achievement through learning for adults

== Principles and competences ==

Competent CLD workers will ensure that their work supports social change and social justice and is based on the values of CLD. Their approach is collaborative, anti-discriminatory and equalities-focused and they work with diverse individuals, communities of place or interest when this is or is not appropriate. Central to their practice is challenging discrimination and its consequences and working with individuals and communities to shape learning and development activities that enhance quality of life and sphere of influence. They have good interpersonal and listening skills and their practice demonstrates that they value and respect the knowledge, experience and aspirations of those involved.&lt;ref name="Competences"&gt;The Competences for Community Learning &amp; Development, 2009 seen at {{cite web |url=http://www.cldstandardscouncil.org.uk/cld/202.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121224014134/http://www.cldstandardscouncil.org.uk/cld/202.html |archivedate=2012-12-24 |df= }}, CLD Standards Council Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government have introduced the following set of principles of which community learning and development related activities should be based on:

# Empowerment – increasing the ability of individuals and groups to influence issues that affect them and their communities;
# Participation – supporting people to take part in decision making;
# Inclusion, equality of opportunity and anti-discrimination – recognising that some people may need additional support to overcome the barriers they face;
# Self-determination – supporting the right of people to make their own choices; and
#Partnership – recognising that many agencies can contribute to CLD to ensure resources are used effectively.

== Wisconsin Model ==

A philosophical base for developing Community Education programs is provided through the five components of the [[Wisconsin]] Model of Community Education. The model provides a process framework for local school districts to implement or strengthen community education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpi.wi.gov/fscp/ce5comp.html Wisconsin's Components of Community Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629071334/http://dpi.wi.gov/fscp/ce5comp.html |date=2008-06-29 }}, Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction&lt;/ref&gt; A set of Community Education Principles was developed by Larry Horyna and Larry Decker for the National Coalition for Community Education in 1991
&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpi.wi.gov/fscp/ceprin.html Community Education Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917174322/http://dpi.wi.gov/fscp/ceprin.html |date=2008-09-17 }}, Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

# Self-determination: Local people are in the best position to identify community needs and wants. Parents, as children's first and most important teachers, have both a right and a responsibility to be involved in their children's education.
# Self-help: People are best served when their capacity to help themselves is encouraged and enhanced. When people assume ever-increasing responsibility for their own well being, they acquire independence rather than dependence.
# Leadership Development: The identification, development, and use of the leadership capacities of local citizens are prerequisites for ongoing self-help and community improvement efforts.
# Localization: Services, programs, events, and other community involvement opportunities that are brought closest to where people live have the greatest potential for a high level of public participation. Whenever possible, these activities should be decentralized to locations of easy public access.
# Integrated Delivery of Services: Organizations and agencies that operate for the public good can use their limited resources, meet their own goals, and better serve the public by establishing close working relationships with other organizations and agencies with related purposes.
# Maximum Use of Resources: The physical, financial, and human resources of every community should be interconnected and used to their fullest if the diverse needs and interests of the community are to be met.
# Inclusiveness: The segregation or isolation of people by age, income, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, or other factors inhibits the full development of the community. Community programs, activities, and services, should involve the broadest possible cross section of community residents.
# Responsiveness: Public institutions have a responsibility to develop programs and services that respond to the continually changing needs and interests of their constituents.
# Lifelong Learning: Learning begins at our birth and continues until death.  Formal and informal learning opportunities should be available to residents of all ages in a wide variety of community settings.

==Role of the professional==

The role of a community learning and development professional depends somewhat on the career path followed. For example, someone working with young people may have different priorities than someone working with adults; however, the outcomes are very similar in a sense that both will be aiming to promote a more socially just and equal society. Community learning and development is a vast field of work and the range of job categories is wide and may include the following: Youth Information Worker, Detached Youth Worker, Community Arts Worker, Community Capacity Worker, Local Authority Community Planning Officer, etc.

Community learning and development workers should see themselves as working with people, rather than for them. Empathy is crucial to understanding the issues faced by those they work with and it is important that they engage in a way that does not intimidate people or place the worker in a position of looking down on those they work with.

The role of a Community learning and development worker is largely different from the role of a formal educator such as a teacher. Community learning and development workers do not follow a curriculum, as they allow the people they work with to form their own way of learning and each individual is believed to have the ability to reach their full potential in life. A community learning and development approach is arguably a more effective way of learning as every individual has their own unique way to learn and community learning and development workers look for the best possible method that suits the individual. Community learning and development approaches are gradually being adopted in schools to some extent and many other agencies and using a community learning and development approach in their work.

In Canada, a university in Alberta has created a Community-based Bachelor of Education program to prepare teachers for rural community education, making it the first university program in Canada that aims at preparing teachers for rural community education.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elaine, Gereluk, Dressler, Roswita; Sandra|first=Eaton, Sarah; Dianne; Dressler; Becker|date=April 30, 2017|title=A rural education teacher preparation program: course design, student support and engagement|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eric&amp;AN=ED573898&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=ERIC, EBSCOhost|volume=|pages=1–15|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qualifications ===

Professional community educators or community learning and development workers usually hold a professional degree in community education or community learning and development, depending on the course offered at the university from which they graduate. In [[Scotland]], qualifications may be Approved by the Standards Council for Community Learning and Development. This means that the course has been assessed by a group of peers - an Approval Panel. The course must have a practice element totalling 40% of the course to gain Approval. More details on the Approval Process and a list of Approved qualifications are available on the Standards Council website www.cldstandardscouncil.org.uk In order to gain entrance to this course, a history of voluntary work is usually desirable.

Many of those working in the field of community learning and development will be doing so voluntarily. These people are usually encouraged to complete a work-place based alternative to the full-time degree course. Others in paid positions may hold qualifications relevant to the field. These people will also be encouraged to study for a degree in community education.

Some university institutions offer post-graduate degrees in community education such as MA, MSc, PGDip, PGCert, etc.

== Participatory democracy ==

===Youth participation===
In countries where democratic governments exist, people are encouraged to vote for someone to represent them. In today's society there is a dwindling interest in politics from our younger generation and this could have a negative effect on our democracy and political system in years to come. Community learning and development has the potential to encourage young people to become more interested in politics and helping them influence decisions that affect their lives.

In many parts of the world, youth parliament-style organisations have been set up to allow young people to debate issues that affect them and others in their community. Young people engage with these organisations voluntarily and are sometimes elected using a democratic system of voting. Young people are at the heart of these organisations and are usually involved in the management and development. The majority of these organisations are facilitated and staffed by workers trained in community learning and development; however, staff role is mainly to facilitate and be supportive but not intrusive.

These organisations allow young people to gain a voice, influence decision makers who affect their lives and provide them with a sense of self-worth and a place in society.

In the United Kingdom, examples of these organisations include the [[United Kingdom Youth Parliament]] (UKYP); in Scotland, the [[Scottish Youth Parliament]] (SYP); in Wales the Children &amp; Young People's Assembly for Wales; and in Northern Ireland, the [http://www.niyf.org/ Northern Ireland Youth Forum]. In Canada, examples include [[Youth Parliament of Manitoba]] (YPM), [[Saskatchewan Youth Parliament]] (SYP), [[TUXIS Parliament of Alberta]] (TUXIS), and [[British Columbia Youth Parliament]] (BCYP).

=== Parental participation ===
Cultural divides and deficit thinking creates mutual distrust between marginalized parents and schools which in turn creates barriers to active parental involvement of marginalized parents in the education of their children.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auerbach|first=Susan|date=May 2007|title=From moral supporters to struggling advocates - Reconceptualizing parent roles in education through the experience of working-class families of color|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edswss&amp;AN=000245968700004&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=Web of Science|volume=42|pages=250–283|via=Social Sciences Citation Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researches also show that parents of high socio-economic status play active and direct role in the education of their children and are more likely to influence school policies that affects their children's schooling whereas parents of low socio-economic status play indirect roles in the education of their children and are less likely to influence school policies that affects their children's schooling.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The gap between parents' educational involvement among parents from higher socio-economic status and parents from lower socio-economic status results in a more personalized education that caters for the needs of children from higher socio-economic backgrounds and more alienating and generic education systems/policies for students from low socio-economic backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The following practices are necessary for parent and community participation in the education of their wards to be effective; students come to school healthy and ready to learn, parents assist schools with financial and or material support, there are frequent communications between parents and school authorities, parents have meaningful authorities in the schools and they also assist in the teaching of their children.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schools count: World Bank project designs and the quality of primary education in Sub-Saharan Africa|last=Ward &amp; Craig|first=Heneveld &amp; Helen|publisher=World Bank|year=1996|isbn=|location=United States|pages=11–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents' home based educational involvement such as creating an enabling learning environment at home, helping their children with their assignments, helping their children develop cognitive skills and other school skills and motivating their children to do well in school supports student success.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seginer|first=Rachel|date=Spring 2006|title=Parents' Educational Involvement: A Developmental Ecology Perspective.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=19381256&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=Parenting: Science and Practice|volume=6|pages=1–48|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researches show that multimodal and effective migrant parental involvement in the education of their children increases the test scores of such students and also shows strong student success even after academic abilities and socio-economic status are taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez, Scribner &amp; Mahitivanichcha|first=Gerardo, Jay $ Kanya|date=Summer 2001|title=Redefining Parental Involvement: Lessons from High-Performing Migrant-Impacted Schools|jstor=3202459|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=38|pages=253–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School officials' racial stereotypes , class stereotypes, biases and attitudes regarding parental involvement in the education of their children hinders school officials from involving parents as partners in the education of their children.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hornby &amp; Lafaele|first=Garry &amp; Rayleen|date=February 2011|title=Barriers to parental involvement in education: an explanatory model.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=57482902&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=Education Review|volume=63|pages=37–52|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, bureaucracies in the public education systems hinders parents from advocating for changes that would benefit their children.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Formally organized parental associations in schools that seeks to increase parental involvement, ignore the cultural and socio-economic needs of minorities, thereby  contributing to the barriers of parental involvement, especially for marginalized parents.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Research shows that high number of marginalized parents do not actively engage in their children's schooling.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; There is also a wide gap between the rhetoric of best parental involvement practices and actual parental involvement practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Effective parental Involvement in the education of their children involves; parenting, communication, volunteering, home tutoring, involvement in decision-making, and collaboration with the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Effective Parental Involvement treats and or makes school officials and parents partners in the education of their children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Deutscher Lehrerpreis''' is a [[teacher award]] in [[Germany]]. It is awarded in two major categories: the first category awards teachers who exhibit innovative teaching practices, and the second category allows students to nominate their teachers for responsible student-teacher collaboration. The award was created and is organized by the [[Vodafone Foundation]] and the [[German Philological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vodafone-stiftung.com/eng_german_teaching_award.html Vodafone foundation website: description of the German teaching award in English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dphv.de/wettbewerbe/lehrerpreis-unterricht-innovativ.html German philological website: description of the German teaching award]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It is supported by German education researchers, such as Professor Dr. Jürgen Baumert who is the vice-president of the [[Max Planck Institute for Human Development]] in Berlin and who conducted the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) study, and German politicians such as Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/ContentArchiv/DE/Archiv17/Artikel/2011/11/2011-11-30-deutscher-lehrerpreis.html Article on the official website of chancellor Angela Merkel about the German teaching award]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award categories==
The award was created by the [[Vodafone Foundation]], the German Philological Foundation, German politicians and education professors, intending to reward the work of teachers and improve public appreciation of teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Lehrerpreis: Ideen und Ziele|url=http://www.lehrerpreis.de/?id=18|website=Deutscher Lehrerpreis|accessdate=5 March 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2011 award ceremony, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said: "''We need teachers with a passion. They are the ones that are responsible for the quality of a school.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deutscher Lehrerpreis für hervorragenden Unterricht|url=https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/ContentArchiv/DE/Archiv17/Artikel/2011/11/2011-11-30-deutscher-lehrerpreis.html|website=Die Bundeskanzlerin|publisher=Presse- und Informationsamt der Bundesregierung|accessdate=5 March 2016|language=German|date=30 November 2011|quote="Wir brauchen Lehrerinnen und Lehrer mit Leidenschaft. Sie sind es, die über die Qualität einer Schule entscheiden."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deutscher Lehrerpreis is awarded in two major categories. The first category is awarded for innovative teaching practices. Teachers from German secondary schools can apply with their projects, and a total of 13,000 Euros are awarded. The second category is awarded for responsible cooperation between students and teachers. Students who are about to graduate or have already graduated may nominate their teachers for the second category.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultur-bildet.de/wettbewerb/deutscher-lehrerpreis-unterricht-innovativ description of the teaching award and the two categories by Deutscher Kulturrat e.V. sponsored by the Bundesminsterium für Bildung und Forschung]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
The German teaching [[award]] always finds a wide media coverage in the German media each year. These articles describe the competition and discuss the importance of good teachers in [[Germany]]. The winning teachers and teaching projects are portrayed and the teachers interviewed. Media coverage regarding the Deutscher Lehrerpreis has appeared in the [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/deutscher-lehrerpreis-in-der-haut-des-fremden-1.2761060 Article in the Süddeutsche Zeitung about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[die Zeit]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2015/48/lehrer-schule-unterricht-deutscher-lehrerpreis Article in die Zeit about the deutscher Lehrerpreis]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Panorama/Uebersicht/Schulen-in-Deutschland 2015 Interview in the HAZ about the deutscher Lehrerpreis winner 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spiegel Online]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/schulspiegel/lehrerpreis-gymnasial-lehrer-aus-bayern-ausgezeichnet-a-1065186.html Article in the Spiegel online about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Focus (German magazine)]] Online,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/regional/baden-wuerttemberg/bildung-zwei-paedagogen-in-baden-wuerttemberg-erhalten-deutschen-lehrerpreis_id_5122484.html Article in the Focus online about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.wdr.de/studio/bonn/themadestages/beste-lehrerin-100.html Article in the WDR about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Abendzeitung München,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.kultusminister-spaenle-begeistert-deutscher-lehrerpreis-fuenf-auszeichnungen-fuer-bayern.2e20812c-933f-40b9-8400-3aedb4f11849.html Article in the Abendzeitung MÜnchen about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Berliner Morgenpost]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morgenpost.de/bezirke/lichtenberg/article206737249/Ronald-Wappke-ist-Berlins-bester-Lehrer.html Article in the Berliner Morgenpost about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deutschlandfunk]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/deutscher-lehrerpreis-herr-voellering-ist-ein-supertyp.680.de.html?dram:article_id=304868 Article in the Deutschlandfunk about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; radio stations such as the [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.br.de/nachrichten/oberbayern/inhalt/gymnasium-olching-lehrerpreis-100.html radio report and article by Bayerischer Rundfunk about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Deutschlandradio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/lehrer-robert-rauh-von-einem-der-auszog-das-schulsystem-zu.2165.de.html?dram%3Aarticle_id=338302 radio report and article by the Deutschlandradio about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Südwestrundfunk]]2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swr.de/swr2/programm/sendungen/impuls/deutscher-lehrerpreis-2015-was-zeichnet-heute-besonders-gute-paedagogen-aus/-/id=1853902/did=16562342/nid=1853902/j4fiq4/index.html radio report and article by the SWR2 about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Television reports regarding the Lehrerpreis and individual award recipients appear on large TV stations such as the [[ARD (broadcaster)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ardmediathek.de/tv/alpha-Forum/Mustafa-Inal-Berufsschullehrer-Deutsch/ARD-alpha/Video?documentId=20865298&amp;bcastId=14912942 TV report and article by the ARD about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Südwestrundfunk]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swr.de/landesschau-aktuell/rp/deutscher-lehrerpreis-verliehen-ausgezeichneter-chemie-lehrer-in-konz/-/id=1682/did=16564002/nid=1682/1ijjmhy/index.html TV report and article by the SWR about the deutscher Lehrerpreis 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/hannover_weser-leinegebiet/Schulbank-druecken-beim-Super-Lehrer,lehrerpreis164.html TV report and article by the NDR about the deutscher Lehrerpreis winner 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ardmediathek.de/tv/Frankenschau-aktuell/Deutschlands-bester-Lehrer-aus-N%C3%BCrnberg/Bayerisches-Fernsehen/Video?documentId=31956552&amp;bcastId=14913732 TV report and article by the Bayerischer Rundfunk about the deutscher Lehrerpreis winner 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite purported and intended benefits, systematic studies have not shown benefits to diversity training and instead show that they backfire and lead to reductions in diversity and to discrimination complaints being taken less seriously.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"&gt;{{Cite web | last1 = Dobbin | first1 = Frank | last2 = Kalev | first2 = Alexandra | url = http://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/why-diversity-management-backfires-and-how-firms-can-make-it-work|title=Why Diversity Management Backfires (And How Firms Can Make it Work)|website=ethics.harvard.edu | publisher = [[Edmond J.

==Controversial issues==
According to Hans Bader, its opponents consider it an oppressive [[ideology]] and reeducation tactic that actually reduces the ability of organizations to attain their goals. It has been suggested that diversity training reinforces differences between individuals instead of fostering their commonalities, thus helping to further racialize the workplace, creating situations where people "tiptoe" around issues such as how to relate to people of different cultures as opposed to people learning to [[communicate]] with and truly understand each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bader | first = Hans | url = https://cei.org/blog/diversity-training-backfires | title = Diversity training backfires | publisher = [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] | website = cei.org| date = 26 December 2007 | access-date = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs which established specific responsibility for diversity, such as [[equal opportunity]] staff positions or diversity task forces, have proven most effective in general. However, the results also indicate that [[White people|White]] females benefit significantly more from diversity training. The benefits for [[African American]] females and males were appreciably lower than European American females. [[Social network|Networking]] and [[mentor]]ing, which were considered bias mitigating approaches, served [[African Americans|African American]] females the most. African American males were the least likely to benefit from any of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalev | first1 = Alexandra | last2 = Dobbin | first2 = Frank | last3 = Kelly | first3 = Erin | title = Best practices or best guesses?

They argue that attempting to see both sides of a controversial issue builds empathy and allows working environments to function better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = Sue | last2 = Brzuzy | first2 = Stephanie | last3 = Gerdes | first3 = Karen | last4 = Hurdle | first4 = Donna | title = Using structured controversy to teach diversity content and cultural competence | journal = Journal of Teaching in Social Work | volume = 23 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 55&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | date = 2003 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandra Kalev conducted a comprehensive review of cultural diversity training conducted in 830 midsize to large U.S. workplaces over a thirty one year period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/19/AR2008011901899.html|title=Most Diversity Training Ineffective, Study Finds|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|date=2008-01-20|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results showed that diversity training was followed by a 7.5 percent drop in the number of women in management. The percentage of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Black, female managers fell by 10 percent. Similar effects were shown for Latinos and Asians. The study did not find that all diversity training is ineffective. Mandatory training programs offered to protect against discrimination lawsuits were called into question. Voluntary diversity training participation to advance organization’s business goals was associated with increased diversity at the management level.

== Purported benefits ==
An analysis of data from over 800 firms over 30 years shows that diversity training and grievance procedures backfires and leads to reductions in the diversity of the firms workforce.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Other research shows that people "were less likely to take discrimination complaints seriously against companies who had diversity programs".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news| last = McElroy | first = Molly | url = http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/04/03/diversity-programs-give-illusion-of-corporate-fairness-study-shows/ | title = Diversity programs give illusion of corporate fairness, study shows | work = UW Today | publisher = [[University of Washington]] | date = 3 April 2013 |access-date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As organizations and communities are becoming more [[Globalization|globalized]], there is a need for an expansion in relation to communication among individuals from all over the world, operating within a diverse environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240550|title=The Myriad Benefits of Diversity in the Workplace|last=Abreu|first=Kim|work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]|access-date= 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe it is beneficial for companies to train a diverse staff, as a reflection of the market in which you wish to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Armache | first = Jalal | title = Diversity in the workplace: benefits and challenges | journal = Journal of International Diversity | volume = 2012 | issue = 1 | pages = 59&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = | date = March 2012 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/75172682/diversity-workplace-benefits-challenges | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jalai Armache, in a heterogeneous workplace environment filled with people knowledgeable of those with different backgrounds and nationalities, there is ability to easily expand an organization.  There is an ability to create inventive solutions to issues being faced in the world market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Dynamic assessment''' is a kind of interactive [[Educational assessment|assessment]] used in [[education]] and the helping professions. Dynamic assessment is a product of the research conducted by [[developmental psychologist]] [[Lev Vygotsky]]. As an alternative assessment modality, it seeks to identify the skills that an individual child possesses as well as their learning potential. The dynamic assessment procedure emphasizes the learning process and accounts for the amount and nature of examiner investment. It is highly interactive and process-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asha.org/practice/multicultural/issues/Dynamic-Assessment/&lt;/ref&gt; It has become popular among educators, psychologists and speech and language pathologists.&lt;ref&gt;Dynamic Assessment in Practice: Clinical And Educational Applications: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (8 Mar. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Assessing Young Children'', Merrill/Prentice Hall, 2003, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haywood, H. Carl &amp; Lidz, Carol Schneider. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xQekS_oqGzoC&amp;q=rapid+growth+of+interest++in+this+topic#v=snippet&amp;q=rapid%20growth%20of%20interest%20%20in%20this%20topic&amp;f=false Dynamic Assessment in Practice: Clinical And Educational Applications]. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It is an alternative to the wide range of standard IQ tests, and it originated in the writings of psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896-1934) of his most mature and highly productive period of 1932-1934. The notion of the [[zone of proximal development]] that he introduced in 1933, roughly a year before his death, served as the banner for his proposal to diagnose development as the level of actual development that can be measured by the child's independent problem solving and, at the same time, the level of proximal, or potential development that is measured in the situation of moderately assisted problem solving by the child.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L.S. (19332-34/1997). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/1934/problem-age.htm The Problem of Age]. in The Collected Works of L. S. Vygotsky, Volume 5, 1998, pp. 187-205&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum level of complexity and difficulty of the problem that the child is capable to solve under some guidance indicates the level of potential development. Then, the difference between the higher level of potential and the lower level of actual development indicates the zone of proximal development. Combination of the two indexes{{--}}the level of actual and the zone of the proximal development{{--}}according to Vygotsky, provides a significantly more informative indicator of psychological development than the assessment of the level of actual development alone.&lt;ref&gt;Chaiklin, S. (2003). "The Zone of Proximal Development in Vygotsky's analysis of learning and instruction." In Kozulin, A., Gindis, B., Ageyev, V. &amp; Miller, S. (Eds.) Vygotsky's educational theory and practice in cultural context. 39-64. Cambridge: Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaretskii,V.K. (2009). The Zone of Proximal Development What Vygotsky Did Not Have Time to Write. Journal of Russian and East European Psychology, vol. 47, no. 6, November–December 2009, pp. 70–93&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas on the zone of development were later developed in a number of psychological and educational theories and practices. Most notably, they were developed under the banner of dynamic assessment that focuses on the testing of learning and developmental potential&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.S. &amp; Grigorenko, E.L. (2001). All testing is dynamic testing. Issues in Education, 7(2), 137-170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.J. &amp; Grigorenko, E.L. (2002). Dynamic testing: The nature and measurement of learning potential. Cambridge (UK): University of Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haywood, C.H. &amp; Lidz, C.S. (2007). Dynamic assessment in practice: Clinical and educational applications. New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; (for instance, in the work of [[Reuven Feuerstein]] and his associates,&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, R., Feuerstein, S., Falik, L &amp; Rand, Y. (1979; 2002). Dynamic assessments of cognitive modifiability. ICELP Press, Jerusalem: Israel&lt;/ref&gt; who has [[Reuven Feuerstein#Difference between IQ test and Dynamic Assessment|criticized standard IQ testing]] for its putative assumption or acceptance of "fixed and immutable" characteristics of intelligence or cognitive functioning). Grounded in developmental theories of Vygotsky and Feuerstein, who recognized that human beings are not static entities but are always in states of transition and transactional relationships with the world, dynamic assessment also received considerable support in the recent revisions of cognitive developmental theory by Joseph Campione, [[Ann Brown]], and [[John D. Bransford]] and in theories of [[multiple intelligences]] by [[Howard Gardner]] and [[Robert Sternberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Kenneth A. Foreword, xiii-xv. In Haywood, H. Carl &amp; Lidz, Carol Schneider. Dynamic Assessment in Practice: Clinical And Educational Applications. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Vygotsky's term [[Zone of Proximal Development]] (ZPD) relates to the gap between what the child can learn unaided, and what he or she can learn with the help of an adult or a more capable peer. According to Vygotsky, it is impossible to understand a child's potential intellectual development using a one-way assessment.

Dynamic assessment is an interactive approach to psychological or psychoeducational assessment that embeds intervention within the assessment procedure. Most typically, there is a pretest then an intervention and then a posttest. This allows the assessor to determine the response of the client or student to the intervention. There are a number of different dynamic assessment procedures that have a wide variety of content domains.

One purpose of dynamic assessment is to determine if a student has the potential to learn a new skill.

There are two major approaches to DA: Interactionist and Interventonist approaches. Interventionist approach is implemented in two formats: sandwich and cake formats.

The '''E-learning maturity model''' (eMM) in [[software engineering]] is a model to assess the capability of electronic [[educational technology]] (e-learning) processes.

== Overview ==
eMM is a quality improvement framework based on the ideas of the [[Capability Maturity Model]] (CMM) and  [[Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination]] (SPICE) methodologies. The underlying idea that guides the development of the eMM is that the ability of an institution to be effective in any particular area of work is dependent on their capability to engage in high quality processes that are reproducible and able to be extended and sustained as demand grows.

The eMM provides a set of thirty-five processes, divided into five process areas, that define a key aspect of the overall ability of institutions to perform well in the delivery of [[e-learning]]. Each process is selected on the basis of its necessity in the development and maintenance of capability in e-learning. All of the processes have been created after a programme of research and testing, conducted internationally.

== History ==
The eMM is being trialled in the Higher Education Academy Benchmarking Pilot, by the [[University of Manchester]]. Additional projects applying the eMM are underway supported by the [[Scottish Funding Council]] in Scotland and ACODE in [[Australia]]. Development and application of the eMM in [[New Zealand]] was supported by the [[New Zealand Ministry of Education]] Tertiary E-Learning Research Fund.

Version 2 of eMM has changed considerably from the Version 1 of 2003. The eMM and associated documentation is licensed under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-[[ShareAlike]] 2.5 License.

== Topics ==

=== Key idea ===
The key idea underlying the [[Eight Dimensional E-Learning Framework|dimension]] concept is holistic capability. Rather than the eMM measuring progressive levels, it describes the capability of a process from these five synergistic perspectives. An organization that has developed capability on all dimensions for all processes will be more capable than one that has not. Capability at the higher dimensions that is not supported by capability at the lower dimensions will not deliver the desired outcomes; capability at the lower dimensions that is not supported by capability in the higher dimensions will be ''ad hoc'', unsustainable and unresponsive to changing organizational and learner needs.

=== Five dimensions ===
Capability in each process is described by a set of practices organised by dimension.

The eMM supplements the CMM concept of maturity levels, which describe the evolution of the organisation as a whole, with dimensions. The five dimensions of the eMM are:
# Delivery
# Planning
# Definition
# Management
# Optimisation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11705">[[File:EcoCAR final SATURN copy.jpg|thumb|400px|right|An international university competition which challenges teams to lead in the development of advanced automotive technologies]]
'''EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge''' is a three-year competition that builds on the 19-year history of [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]] [[Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions (AVTC)|advanced vehicle technology competitions]] by giving engineering students the chance to design and build advanced vehicles that demonstrate leading-edge automotive technologies, with the goal of minimizing the environmental impact of personal transportation and illustrating pathways to a sustainable transportation future. The DOE has again joined [[General Motors|General Motors (GM)]], the [[Government of Canada]] (Transport Canada, Natural Resources Canada), and other sponsors for this new competition series, named the EcoCAR Challenge. [[Argonne National Laboratory]], a DOE research and development facility, will organize and operate the EcoCAR Challenge. Some previous types of advanced vehicle technology competitions include FutureTruck, FutureCar, and [[Challenge X]]. These type of competitions are usually supported by one or more of the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)#United States and Canada|Big Three American Automobile Manufacturers]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocarchallenge|title=EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge|website=www.ecocar2.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background on EcoCAR ==
The DOE announced a Notice of Program Interest for North American colleges and universities with accredited engineering programs to compete for the opportunity to participate in EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge—a new international collegiate vehicle engineering competition—through a request-for-proposal (RFP) process in 2008.

EcoCAR seeks to advance the level of vehicle technology capable of reducing petroleum consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions while demonstrating the real-world performance of a range of technology options. Schools interested in receiving an RFP describing in detail the requirements for competing for one of the up to 17 available slots in EcoCAR were invited to express their interest.

== Technology Development ==
The technologies explored in EcoCAR are identical to those being investigated by the automotive industry to meet the demands of improved energy efficiency and dramatic reductions in [[Greenhouse gas]] (GHG)s, as well as to address [[Zero-emissions vehicle|California zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV)]] regulations. These technologies include full-function electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell hybrid vehicles. The only fuels approved for use in EcoCAR are [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|E10 ethanol]], [[E85|E85 ethanol]], [[Biodiesel|B20 biodiesel]], compressed gaseous hydrogen, and the energy carrier electricity.

Teams selected will design and integrate advanced-technology powertrains, lightweight materials, and aerodynamic improvements into a production vehicle. Using this approach, EcoCAR will explore pathways for future vehicles while giving the student participants the knowledge and experience they need to rapidly develop critical engineering skills and become the next generation of leaders in the automotive industry.

EcoCAR is based on a real-world integrated vehicle design and development process. Teams of engineers from the selected schools will develop their vehicles following a modified GM Global Vehicle Development Process (GVDP) for each phase of the three-year competition. By the end of the competition, the sponsors expect fully developed vehicles equivalent to prototypes ready for a production decision. While applying proven methods for engineering successful prototype vehicles, students will learn real-world engineering skills that will make them highly effective in the automotive industry. At the conclusion of each of EcoCAR’s three years, a week-long competition involving all of the participating schools will take place at a GM vehicle proving ground or other appropriate location in [[North America]].

== Participation ==
[[File:Seed Money.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Virginia Tech's Team Leader, Adam Robinson, accepting GM's Seed Money]]
Teams will receive $10,000 in seed money in Year One, a wide range of powertrain components, a vehicle donated by GM, and technical and mentoring support from the competition sponsors. EcoCAR teams will also have a GM mentor knowledgeable in technologies relevant to the team assigned to assist them during the competition. Substantial funds will also be provided to each university to support a full-time graduate student who will provide the team with leadership and continuity over the three-year program.

Schools will be required to match cash seed money donations from EcoCAR sponsors and to provide class credit for students participating in the competition, release time equal to at least one class per semester for a faculty advisor from the engineering school, and logistical and promotional support for their team. Teams may also be asked to match seed money each year to support a full-time, graduate-level engineering team leader. A signed letter of support will be required from the Dean of the Engineering Department with each proposal. If accepted into EcoCAR, each school will be required to sign an annual Good Faith Agreement reaffirming the school's full support of their team and explicitly stating its willingness to participate in all EcoCAR activities with at least one faculty advisor in attendance.

== Outreach ==
[[File:MiddleSchoolOutreach.jpg|thumb|255px|right|Virginia Tech team members Mark Meyer, left, and Graham Burkholder, right, show how their hybrid controller works to interested middle school students.]]
As part of the competition, EcoCAR teams are required to participate in different types of outreach events. These events include things such as press releases, community outreach, K-12 education, etc. Each team is asked to reach out to their communities and get them interested in EcoCAR.

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}

Some [[North America]]n [[university|universities]] are home to [[academic degree|degree]] programs titled '''Ecology and Evolutionary Biology''', offering integrated studies in the [[academic discipline|disciplines]] of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. The wording is intended as representing the alternative approach from the frequently used pairing of '''Cell and Molecular Biology''', while being more inclusive than the terminology of [[Botany]] or [[Zoology]].  Recently, due to advances in the fields of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], research and education in ecology and evolutionary biology has integrated many molecular techniques.

A program that focuses on the relationships and interactions that range across levels of biological organization based on a scientific study is Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  The origins and history of ecosystems, species, genes and genomes, and organisms, and how these have changed over time is all part of the studies of how biodiversity has evolved and how it takes place.  Ecology and Evolutionary biology in North America is based on research impact determined by the top 10% of ecology programs.  The interactive web of organisms and environment are all part of what the field of Ecology explores.  There have been studies in evolution that have worked to prove that "modern organisms have developed from ancestral ones." The reason that evolutionary biology is so interesting to learn about is because of the evolutionary processes that is the reason we have such a diversity of life on Earth.There are many processes that make up evolutionary biology that give great insight to how we came to be, some of which include natural selection, speciation, and common descent.

''2001 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor''. [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (2002). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The system of education in Antigua &amp; Barbuda is based on the British educational system. The school year begins in September and ends in June of the following year. In order to ensure that all costs related to schooling are covered by the government, there is an education levy on all basic wages in Antigua and Barbuda, with the funds used toward such costs as supplies, transportation, and school infrastructure maintenance.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Primary education begins at the age of five years and normally lasts for seven years. Secondary education lasts for five years, with three years of lower secondary, followed by two years of upper secondary. In 2001, there were about 13,000 students enrolled at the primary schools and 5,000 students at the secondary schools. About 1,000 secondary school age students were enrolled in vocational programs. As of 2000 the primary pupil-teacher ratio was an estimated 19 to 1; the ratio for secondary school was about 13:1. The [[Government of Antigua and Barbuda|government]] administers the majority of the schools. In 2003, estimated spending on education was about 3.8% of the [[GDP]]. In 2000, about 38% of primary school students were enrolled in private schools.
[[File:Aid to Basic Education, the amount of bilateral and multilateral aid contributed or received by Antigua and Barbuda.png|thumb|Aid to Basic Education, the amount of bilateral and multilateral aid contributed or received by Antigua and Barbuda (source:UNESCO)]]
There currently are three colleges. The [[University of Health Sciences Antigua]], was founded in 1982. It had, in the 1990s, an enrollment of 46 students and 16 teachers. The University of the West Indies School of Continuing Studies (Antigua and Barbuda) was founded in 1949 and offers adult education courses, secretarial skills training programs, summer courses for children, and special programs for women. In 1972, the technical and teacher’s training colleges merged and formed the [[Antigua State College]].

The University of the West Indies has campuses in [[Barbados]], [[Trinidad]], and [[Jamaica]], and it maintains extramural departments in several other islands, including [[Antigua]]. Those interested in higher education also enroll at schools in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and [[Canada]].  The [[adult literacy rate]] is approximately 89%.

'''Educational music,'''  is a genre of music in which songs, lyrics, or other musical elements are used as a method of teaching and/or learning. It has been shown in research to promote learning.{{ref|songsforteaching}}{{ref|SmartSongs}} Additionally, music study in general has been shown to improve academic performance of students.{{ref|Standley2008}}{{ref|musichelps1}}{{ref|musichelps2}} &lt;br /&gt; 

Music used for learning can be in many formats, including video recordings, audio recordings, [[sheet music]], and [[improvised music]]. Most of the time, music is added to an existing lesson plan or story. Songs are usually easy to sing and catchy, so that they can be repeated for later learning. Some [[children's music]] is considered Educational, and, historically, most educational music is geared towards children. Prominent examples include songs from [[LazyTown]], ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', [[Smart Songs]]' educational rap videos on YouTube, and [[Tom Lehrer]]'s songs for the [[PBS]] show ''[[The Electric Company]]''.

Recent developments have extended music's use to secondary and collegiate education, with [[Cornel West]] breaking new ground in this regard.{{ref|Cornish2001}}

== Forms ==
=== Video ===
Video recordings are the most use of educational music. Television shows, DVDs, and even some movies use music to teach the viewer, whether it be a moral lesson or a scholastic lesson. [[Sesame Street]] and [[Schoolhouse Rock]] are examples of shows that use music to teach topics like math, science, and government. Things like counting, the names of the planets, or the law making process are put to music with simple lyrics to aid in retention of information.

Shows such as [[Little Einsteins]] use music as a story aid to teach decision-making and music recognition. [[Instrumental music]] represents different objects, people, animals, or actions to help the viewer distinguish between various options.

Shows such as [[Veggie Tales]] use a story as well as music to teach biblical and moral lessons to its viewers. This form uses songs  to tie the story together and help the viewer remember important aspects of the story.

=== Audio ===
Audio music recordings are also used prominently as a form of education. The website Songs for Teaching&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songsforteaching.com/ songsforteaching.com]&lt;/ref&gt; has many songs for teachers to use to help kids learn. Baby Genius is a very popular company that produces educational music CDs for children. 
The European Union funded an education project to encourage early language learning called Lullabies of Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://lullabies-of-europe.org/ lullabies-of-europe.org]&lt;/ref&gt; that gathered and recorded lullabies in 7 European languages. Some Television shows and DVD series also make Audio recordings of their songs to further learning. 
*'''Sheet Music''' is sometimes used to aid in teaching when a song is new and the student can read music. Sheet music is usually used in conjunction with a CD or instrumentation.

=== Improvised ===
Improvisation is used in educational music in a few settings. Teachers might make up a song for times tables and teach it to the students, perhaps having students add parts. Some people also make up songs to remember things or to study for a test.

=== Hip hop ===
[[Hip-hop]] demonstrates increasing relevance and success as a pedagogical tool in primary and secondary education.  [[Flocabulary]] and Defined Mind,{{ref|Monitor}} focusing primarily on vocabulary building for [[SAT]] and [[ACT_(examination)]] tests, have established a Web presence in addition to their textbooks.  [[Smart Songs]],{{ref|Providence}} concentrating on middle school, offers amusing and pertinent music video. [[Rhythm, Rhyme, Results]] uses [[hip hop]] music to help students learn lessons ranging from economics to photosynthesis.{{ref|phoenix}} MC SKULE (Rohen Shah) of the non-profit SKULE.org makes parody music videos of popular songs where the lyrics teach math.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/section/news/daily-educational-rap-video-encourages-students-enjoy-math|title=On the Daily: Educational rapper gives math a new beat|work=The Michigan Daily|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Kajitani]], the 2009 California State Teacher of the Year, created original middle school math songs as the Rappin' Mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nnstoy.org/stoy/alex-kajitani/|title=Alex Kajitani, California State Teacher of the Year 2009 - National Network of State Teachers of the Year|work=National Network of State Teachers of the Year|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs that integrate music with education ==
=== Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA)===
Some schools integrate music with other subjects in the hope that the music and the other subjects enhance each other. With this mutual growth, educators hope to improve the overall quality and experiences of education.

One program that integrates music in education is the Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA) program, which is done through the [[Kennedy Center]]. CETA is a partnership between the Kennedy Center and eight arts focus schools in the [[Washington D.C.]] area. They work together to produce staff that can integrate the arts across the curriculum. CETA aims to integrate music and other arts, such as dance and visual arts, into other scholastic areas, such as math and science "...to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.”{{ref|CETA}}

The objectives of CETA are to:
# Develop the knowledge, skills, and beliefs in the arts among individual teachers so they can integrate the arts across the curriculum to enhance student learning 
# Purposefully network these individuals in their own schools and with teachers in participating schools to develop their understanding and confidence in integrating the arts across the curriculum 
# Provide an extensive system of internal and external support and resources to the teachers, schools, and the network
# Share knowledge and experiences with other educators and arts organizations both locally and nationally{{ref|CETA}}

=== Arts Horizons ===
Arts Horizons is an arts in education organization that serves schools in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. They integrate music, as well as other arts, into learning to help children gain appreciation for the arts as well as stimulate children “through the arts to improve their proficiency in reading, writing and math.”{{ref|ArtsHorizons}}

Arts Horizons has a variety of programs, including:
* Interactive live performances by professional artists from Broadway, Lincoln Center and around the world 
* Artist in residence programs, custom-designed for your school, that make connections between the arts and the classroom curriculum 
* Three	Professional development inspires teachers to introduce innovative, creative approaches in the classroom and implement state learning standards.{{ref|ArtsHorizons}}

An example of an assembly provided by Arts Horizons is the Peter and the Wolf program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artshorizons.org/programs/images/wolf.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725014759/http://artshorizons.org/programs/images/wolf.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, an actor tells the tale of Peter and the Wolf while a woodwind quintet plays the music of Prokofiev to bring the story to life. After the story, students have a chance to learn about the woodwind instruments that were used in the story, as well as other woodwind instruments, and hear other folk tales.{{ref|ArtsHorizons}}

== Effects of music on education ==
CETA has concrete evidence on the following:
* Rising student test scores on the state exams.  For example, Fort Hunt Elementary progressed from “not being accredited” to being “provisionally accredited” to being “fully accredited” within the course of three years.  
* Fewer student disciplinary referrals to the office.
* Higher attendance rates.
* Anecdotes by teachers about student learning in the arts and other subject areas.{{ref|CETA}}

There have been many studies on the use of music to aid in teaching, as well as how an individual who plays music fares in their education. Results show that using music when teaching children to read, for example, can help children learn how to read and give lasting results.{{ref|Standley2008}} A study on elementary students even showed that students with music training have overall better verbal memory, compared to the memory of those students of the same demographic without music training.{{ref|Chan2003}}

The '''filmstrip''' was a common form of [[still image]] instructional [[multimedia]], once commonly used by educators in primary and secondary schools (K-12), overtaken at the end of the 1980s by newer and increasingly lower-cost full-motion [[videocassette]]s and later on by [[DVD]]s. From the 1940s to 1980s, filmstrips provided an easy and inexpensive alternative to [[16 mm film|16 mm]] educational films, requiring very little storage space and being very quick to rewind for the next use.  Filmstrips were large and durable, and rarely needed splicing. They are still used in some areas.

== Technology ==
[[File:Filmstrip S-J-Bosco 3.jpg|thumb|Filmstrip from S. Juan Bosco Editorial]]
A filmstrip is a spooled roll of [[35 mm film|35 mm positive film]] with approximately thirty to fifty images arranged in sequential order. Like 16&amp;nbsp;mm film, a filmstrip was inserted vertically down in front of the projector aperture, rather than horizontally as in a slide projector. Therefore, the frame size is smaller than normal 35&amp;nbsp;mm film. Two image frames of a filmstrip take up the same amount of space as a single 35mm frame, including its guard band, so that a 25 exposure 35mm film can contain 50 filmstrip images.  Early [[celluloid]] filmstrips had a habit of [[melting]] or [[combustion|combusting]] from the intense and sustained heat of the projection lamp.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} These were called pictural filmstrips, the first filmstrips that were produced in a complete set{{clarify|date=September 2012}}.

Typically, a filmstrip's running time was between ten and twenty minutes. Depending on how they were narrated or produced, filmstrips (which often came with an instructor's guide) were flexible enough to be used in both self-paced learning formats or a full classroom. In addition to a standard classroom wall or screen projector, personal film display units were available with a screen size of approximately eight inches diagonal for up-close viewing by one or two people.

The instructor would turn on a [[filmstrip projector]] that would show the first frame (image) of the filmstrip. The instructor then turned on a 33 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] record or [[cassette tape]] containing the audio material for the filmstrip which included narration. At the appropriate point, a tone would sound, signaling the instructor to turn a knob, advancing to the next frame. Later, technical improvements allowed the projector to advance the film automatically.

== Film production ==
By the later part of the 1960s, such firms as [[Warren Schloat Productions]], [[CBS]], [[The New York Times Company]], [[Scott Education]], [[Coronet Films]], [[Sunburst Media]], and [[Guidance Associates]] were producing titles featuring photographs by famous artists and of notable events with a synchronized audio track. The music and narration for the filmstrip originally came on a [[gramophone record|vinyl record]].

In the 1970s, audio technology advanced, and vinyl records gave way to [[compact audio cassette|audio cassettes]] and became useful in providing individualized instruction. Students could now watch and listen to a filmstrip over and over at their own pace. Filmstrips also moved beyond traditional arts and humanities courses, branching into the science, career, vocational and technical subject areas led by such firms as Bergwall Productions &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bergwall.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and Prentice Hall Media (Formerly Warren Schloat Productions.) There were filmstrips produced in many different subject areas including music, art, [[language arts]], math, business and even [[home economics]].

=== Home entertainment ===
In the early 1950s production companies started producing filmstrips for home entertainment. There were a number of films from Disney, and also from the Society for Visual Education Inc.(Chicago),&lt;ref name="SVE"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvard University|title=Society for Visual Education Inc|url=http://dssmhi1.fas.harvard.edu/emuseumdev/code/emuseum.asp?action=advsearch&amp;newsearch=1&amp;profile=people&amp;rawsearch=constituentid/,/is/,/950/,/false/,/true&amp;style=single&amp;searchdesc=Society%20for%20Visual%20Education,%20Inc |accessdate=7 April 2013|year=1|publisher=Harvard University|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other manufacturers.

=== Eastern Europe production ===
{{Confusing|section|date=October 2013}}
Film strips were popular in the USSR because movie projectors and VCRs were not in common use until the early 1990s. A great number of films were produced by the "Diafilm" studio. Many filmstrips were produced by "cinematographic studios" in former Soviet bloc countries such as Poland and Hungary during the 1950s–1960s.
 
In Greece they were known and sold by the name "tainies Argo Film" (ARGO FILM movies) from the name of the company (ARGO FILM) that translated the scripts into Greek and organized the productions' distribution in Greece. The titles included children's stories, fairy tales, Greek history, Christianity, adventure, science fiction and war stories.

== Automatic film advance ==
During the 1970s, advanced projectors became available, and these projectors would automatically advance the film by means of a 50 [[Hertz|Hz]] [[subaudible tone]] recorded on the cassette that would be detected by the projector, and automatically advance the frame. Most cassettes accompanying filmstrips in the 1970s and 1980s would have the same audio material on both sides of the tape. One side would have audible tones for the older projectors, and the other side would have the subaudible tones for the newer automatic projectors. Some select filmstrip releases had both audible and subaudible tones combined, making the filmstrip and its companion cassette compatible with any filmstrip projector. If improperly set up, the narration and film would not be synchronized.

From the late 1970s to the beginning of 1980, because most filmstrip publishers stopped making their sound filmstrip sets with [[LP record]]s, audiovisual companies started producing automatic filmstrip projectors with built-in cassette players to better meet the audiovisual needs of teachers and school librarians. In 1979-1980 the [[DuKane Corporation]] in [[St. Charles, Illinois]] began to produce a cassette automatic filmstrip projector called the DuKane Micromatic II. This automatic filmstrip projector was easier to use by loading the filmstrip in the projector backward when the plastic upper film spring was flipped back{{clarify|date=September 2012}}. Loading the cassettes into the projector's cassette compartment was also easier with a control panel for the filmstrip and accompanying cassette. This filmstrip projector also had 50&amp;nbsp;Hz synchronization and could also be operated by remote control when set on manual mode. It was very popular with classroom and music teachers and school librarians. DuKane also produced their new line of silent filmstrip projectors which were also popular in schools. The La Belle Commpak system always use 1000 Hz tone to advance to the next slide. It will be embedded on to the Commpak 8track cartridge. Then it will be played on to la belle tutor 16/la belle duo 16 system. The [[general electric]] show 'n' tell record system use 16mm for film and record for audio and cool thing is the 16mm played upside down advance to the next frame. Simelar to la belle commpak system and dukane filmstrip projector the [[general electric]] show 'n' tell system contains any story on 1 16mm film format.

== Decline and obsolescence ==
The 1980s brought the advent of the [[video cassette recorder]] (VCR), and advancing technology meant increasingly affordable VCRs. When VCRs became within reach for most schools' budgets, this marked beginning of a decline in filmstrip use. Video instruction combined the ease of the filmstrip with automatically synchronized audio and [[full motion video]]. By the early 1990s, the vast majority of filmstrip producers that were not equipped to compete with video either closed or sold their businesses.

In the late 1990s to early 2000s, some audiovisual companies (such as [[Society for Visual Education Inc.]],&lt;ref name="SVE"/&gt; [[Educational Audio Visual]], and [[Metro Audio Visual]]) were still producing filmstrips for schools and libraries. When VHS, DVD, multimedia projectors and computers became popular in schools and libraries, however, filmstrips ceased to be used in schools, and many public libraries no longer had filmstrips in their catalogs. By the mid-2000s many schools no longer wanted to purchase filmstrips, and audiovisual companies stopped producing them.

Graduating from [[Maynooth College]] with undergraduate and master's degrees, he qualified as a school teacher and taught Irish and religion at St. Kevin's College, Ballygall Road, in Dublin 11. In November 2015 he was appointed Gaelic Games Executive at [[University College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucd.ie/newsandopinion/news/gerbrennanappointedgaelicgamesexecutiveatucd/ Ger Brennan appointed Gaelic Games Executive at UCD] www.ucd.ie, November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
===Club===
Brennan won his first [[Dublin Senior Football Championship]] medal with St Vincents in 2007 in the final against [[St Brigids]] at [[Parnell Park]]. He then went on to win the [[Leinster Senior Club Football Championship]] final against Tyrrellspass of [[Westmeath GAA|Westmeath]]. Brennan was chosen as the Leinster club player of the year for his performances in the Leinster club championship with St Vincents.

Brennan won the 2008 [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]] with [[St Vincents GAA|St Vincents]] in a hard fought game. He won the [[Dublin Senior Football Championship]] for St. Vincents, as captain, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thescore.ie/st-vincents-dublin-football-champions-1164006-Nov2013/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131107123144/http://www.thescore.ie/st-vincents-dublin-football-champions-1164006-Nov2013/ |archivedate=2013-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-county===
Brennan madee his national league debut for Dublin against [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] on 3 February 2007.  He was a member of Dublin team that won the [[2007 O'Byrne Cup|2007]] [[O'Byrne Cup]], playing against Laois at [[O'Connor Park]] in Offaly. The game finished on a scoreline of 1-18 to 2-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/?jp=CWSNOJEYAUQL]&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the tournament with a total of 0-04.

In 2008, he retired from Dublin's football panel, citing burnout and fatigue as his reasons. However, on July 30, 2008, he was named in Dublin's panel for the quarter-final and accepted a return. He was part of the victorious Dublin squad that won the 2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. He won an All-Ireland with Dublin for a second time in 2013, scoring two points in the final against Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/dublin-are-all-ireland-champions-29597446.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Brennan announced his retirement from Inter County football but will continue to play club football.

==Personal life==
Brennan is a Catholic who has spoken about his faith in God. He has stated that while non-denominational schools may teach subjects such as science, Catholic schools "enable young students to have the skills to pray".&lt;ref name=time_to_learn_about_faith&gt;{{cite news|first=Pamela|last=Duncan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/ger-brennan-says-time-for-young-people-to-learn-more-about-faith-1.1661808|title=Ger Brennan says time for young people to learn more about faith: Catholic Schools Week 2014 begins next Sunday, January 26th|work=The Irish Times|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan was praised for his "nonchalant delivery" of thanks to the "girlfriends and boyfriends of the players" after St Vincent's defeated Castlebar Mitchels in the 2014 All-Ireland Club Championship Final at Croke Park (a speech delivered in front of a live television audience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26646416|title=Ger Brennan's 'inclusive' speech praised by gay rights groups|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=19 March 2014|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However just over a year later, Brennan wrote an op-ed for the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' arguing against the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage]] in that year's [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Marriage Equality referendum]], which was ultimately carried in a 62% to 38% popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ger|last=Brennan|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/referendum/dublin-football-star-ger-brennan-why-im-voting-no-31217917.html|title=Dublin football star Ger Brennan: Why I'm voting No|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His stance was criticised by others, including fellow GAA star [[Conor Cusack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Cullen|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/conor-cusack-challenges-dubs-star-ger-brennan-on-opposition-to-samesex-marriage-31220546.html|title=Conor Cusack challenges Dubs star Ger Brennan on opposition to same-sex marriage|newspaper=Evening Herald|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Humanitas''''' is a [[Latin]] noun meaning human nature, civilization, and kindness.

==Classical origins of term==
The Latin word ''humanitas'' corresponded to the Greek concepts of ''[[Philanthropy#Classical Philanthropy|philanthrôpía]]'' (loving what makes us human) and ''[[paideia]]'' (education) which were amalgamated with a [[Virtue#Roman virtues|series of qualities]] that made up the traditional unwritten Roman code of conduct (''[[mos maiorum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;The opening chapter of Cicero's [[Tusculan Disputations]] enumerates some of them: ''Quae enim tanta gravitas, quae tanta constantia, magnitudo animi, probitas, fides, quae tam excellens in omni genere virtus in ullis fuit, ut sit cum maioribus nostris comparanda?'' "For what weight of character, what firmness, magnanimity, probity, good faith, what surpassing virtue of any type, has been found in any people to such a degree as to make them the equals of our ancestors?" (''Tusculanae Disputationes'' 1.2.). Of the Roman political virtues, Richard Bauman judges clemency as the most important. See Richard A. Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC) used ''humanitas'' in describing the formation of an ideal speaker ([[orator]]) who he believed should be [[Education|educated]] to possess a collection of virtues of character suitable both for an active life of public service and a decent and fulfilling private life; these would include a fund of learning acquired from the study of ''bonae litterae'' ("good letters", i.e., classical literature, especially poetry), which would also be a source of continuing cultivation and pleasure in leisure and retirement, youth and old age, and good and bad fortune.&lt;ref&gt;The word occurs also in other Latin writers of the Classical period. For example, ''cultus atque humanitas'' ("culture and humanity"), meaning "civilization", appears in the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=1&amp;division=div2  opening sentences] of [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars]] (1. 1. 3), where Caesar calls the tribe of the Belgae the bravest, because farthest away from Romanized Southern France ([[Provence]]). It also occurs five times in the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', for centuries erroneously attributed to Cicero but which in fact predates him. However, the concept was most fully elaborated by Cicero, who uses the word 299 times, accounting for about half of the 463 occurrences in all the other Classical Latin writers together. See [http://www.tulliana.eu/documenti/Oniga_Humanitas.pdf Renato Oniga, "Humanitas"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in ''Tulliana'' (2009) II. On the distinctly Roman cast of Cicero's adaptation of the concept of ''humanitas'' from the Greek ''[[paidea]]'', Oniga cites a 1973 study by the German scholar Wolfgang Schadewaldt:&lt;blockquote&gt;...''l’essenza della'' humanitas ''romana sta propriamente nell’essere l’altra faccia di un insieme ordinato di valori molto precisi e severi, che facevano parte del codice di comportamento del cittadino romano fin dalle origini, e sono pressoché intraducibili in greco: la ''pietas ''(che è qualcosa di diverso dalla'' eusébeia''), ''mores'' (che non coincidono esattamente con l''’ethos), ''e poi la'' dignitas'', la ''gravitas'', l’''integritas, ''e così via. L’idea di humanitas riassumeva in sé tuttiquesti valori . . . ma nello stesso tempo li sfumava, li rendeva meno rigidi e più universali.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; ...the essence of Roman ''humanitas'' is that it constitutes one of the aspects of an orderly complex of very distinct and severe values that had been part of the code of conduct of a Roman citizen from the outset and are virtually untranslatable in Greek: ''pietas'' (which is different from ''[[Eusebeia#Classical Greek usage|eusébeia]]''), ''mores'' (which do not coincide exactly with ''[[ethos]]''), and ''dignitas'', ''gravitas'', ''integritas'', and so on. The idea of ''humanitas'' subsumed all these values ... simultaneously blurring their outlines, rendering them less rigid and more universal.&lt;/blockquote&gt; See Wolfgang Schadewaldt, “Humanitas Romana" (in Hildegard Temporini and Wolfgang Haase, editors, ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' I.4, 1973, p. 47). For further discussion of Schadewaldt's essay, see also Bauman's ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', pp. 21–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as ''humanitas'' corresponded to ''philanthrôpía'' and ''paideia'', it was particularly applicable to guiding the proper exercise of power over others. Hence Cicero's advice to his brother that "if fate had given you authority over Africans or Spaniards or Gauls, wild and barbarous nations, you would still owe it to your ''humanitas'' to be concerned about their comforts, their needs, and their safety."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Greg Woolf]], ''Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing Cicero over a century later, [[Pliny the Younger]] (61-112 A.D.) defined ''humanitas'' as the capacity to win the affections of lesser folk without impinging on greater (Ep. IX, 5).&lt;ref&gt;See Zvi Yavetz, ''Plebs and Princeps'' (Transaction Publishers, 1988),  p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival in Early Italian Renaissance==
The concept was of great importance during the re-discovery of [[Classical Antiquity]] during the age of the [[Renaissance]] by the Italian ''[[Renaissance Humanism|umanisti]]'', beginning with the illustrious Italian poet [[Petrarch]], who revived Cicero's injunction to cultivate the [[humanities]], understood during the Renaissance as grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium (education)|Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content, and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. —[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion 17'' (1944–45), pp. 346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1333, in [[Liège]], [[Belgium]], Petrarch had found and copied out in his own hand a manuscript of Cicero's speech, ''[[Pro Archia Poeta|Pro Archia]]'', which contained a famous passage in defense of poetry and ''litterae'' (letters): &lt;blockquote&gt;''Haec studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solacium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur.'' (Translation: "These studies sustain youth and entertain old age, they enhance prosperity, and offer a refuge and solace in adversity; they delight us when we are at home without hindering us in the wider world, and are with us at night, when we travel and when we visit the countryside").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1695391 ''Pro Archia'' paragraph 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Petrarch liked this quotation and referred to it often, and where Cicero used the phrase "''litterarum lumen''", "the light of literature", Petrarch in the margin wrote ''lumen litterarum'' alongside and drew a sketch of a lamp or candle. The Liège manuscript is lost and so is Petrarch's copy, but Petrarch's copy "can be shown to be behind all but one of the later manuscripts" and preserve Petrarch's marginal annotations.&lt;ref&gt;MIchael D. Reeve writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If it is true that Italian humanists had no expression closer to ‘classical scholarship’ than ''studia humanitatis'', the ''Pro Archia'' provided classical scholarship in the Renaissance with its charter of foundation. In Petrarch’s attention to ''Pro Archia'' eight elements can be distinguished:
#	He discovered the speech.
#	He liked it because it extolled poetry
#	He used it in works of his own
#	He marked details in it, sometimes because related things had struck him elsewhere in his reading of ancient literature
#	He adjusted its text
#	He spoke of his discovery in correspondence that he put in wider circulation
#	He put the speech itself into wide circulation
#	Such was his prestige both as a writer and as a collector that after his death ''Pro Archia'' became one of many texts in his library sought out for copying.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
See Michael D. Reeve, "Classical Scholarship" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism'', Jill Kraye, editor (Cambridge, 1996), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrarch, in many respects a Medieval man, regretted that Cicero had not been a Christian and believed that he certainly would have been one had he not died before the birth of Jesus. To Petrarch and the Renaissance ''umanisti'' who immediately followed him, Cicero's ''humanitas'' was not seen as in conflict with Christianity or a Christian education. In this they followed the fifth century Church fathers such as  Jerome and Augustine, who taught that Greek and Roman learning and literature were gifts of God and models of excellence, provided, of course, they were filtered and purified in order to serve Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Ernst Robert Curtius recounts that "St. Jerome furnished the Middle Ages with an oft repeated argument for utilizing antique learning in the service of Christianity: In Deuteronomy 21 :12: If a Hebrew desires to marry  a heathen slave, he shall cut her hair and her nails. In like manner the Chritian who loves secular learning shall purify it from all errors. Then it is worthy to serve God." St. Augustine "in his allegorical exposition of Exodus 3 : 22  and 12 : 35: When they went out of Egypt the Israelites took gold and silver vessels with them, thus the Christian must rid pagan learning of what is superfluous and pernicious, that he may place it in the service of truth." See [[Ernst Robert Curtius]], ''European Literature in the Latin Middle Ages'' (Princeton, N.J.: Bollingen Series / Princeton University Press, 1973 [1953]), p. 40 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitas during the French Enlightenment==
According to historian [[Peter Gay]], the eighteenth-century French [[philosophes]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found Cicero's eclectic, [[Stoicism|Stoic]]-tinged paganism congenial:&lt;blockquote&gt;The ideal of ''humanitas'' was first brought to Rome by the philosophic circle around Scipio and further developed by Cicero. For Cicero, ''humanitas'' was a style of thought, not a formal doctrine. It asserted man’s importance as a cultivated being, in control of his moral universe. The man who practiced ''humanitas'' was confident of his worth, courteous to others, decent in his social conduct, and active in his political role. He was a man, moreover, who faced life with courageous skepticism: he knows that the consolations of popular religion are for more credulous beings than himself, that life is uncertain, and that sturdy pessimism is superior to self-deceptive optimism. Man becomes man as he refines himself; he even becomes godlike: “''Deus est mortali iuvare mortalem'',” wrote Pliny, translating a Greek Stoic, “To help man is man’s true God.” Finally, the man who practiced ''humanitas'' cultivated his aesthetic sensibilities as he listened to his reason: "''Cum musis,''” wrote Cicero, “''id est, cum humanitate et doctrina habere commercium''".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay's citation of the phrase, ''Cum musis'', etc., refers to an anecdote in the ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', in which Cicero recounts how during a visit to Syracuse, in Sicily, he had chanced to discover the tomb of [[Archimedes]], at that time unknown to the inhabitants of the city, but which he, Cicero, recognized from its description in a line of poetry he had memorized; and he contrasted the enduring fame of Archimedes, the mathematician, to the obloquy of the notorious Sicilian tyrant  [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius the Elder]], buried nearby: “Who is there who has had anything at all to do with the Muses, that is, with humanity and learning, who would not prefer to be this mathematician rather than that tyrant? If we look into their manner of life and employment, the mind of the one was nourished by seeking out and pondering theories, accompanied by the delight in his cleverness, which is the sweetest sustenance of souls, that of the other in murder and wrongdoing, accompanied by fear both day and night” (TD 5.64–5). This anecdote is one of the sources for the humanist commonplace that poetry is a more lasting monument than stone. See Mary Jaeger, ”Cicero and Archimedes Tomb", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 92, (2002), pp. 51–52. The incident is recalled by [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''Call Archimedes from his buried tomb
''Upon the plain of vanished Syracuse,
''And feelingly the Sage shall make report
''How insecure, how baseless in itself,
''Is the Philosophy, whose sway depends
''On mere material instruments;—how weak
''Those arts, and high inventions, if unpropped
''By virtue.—He, sighing with pensive grief,
''Amid his calm abstractions, would admit
''That not the slender privilege is theirs
''To save themselves from blank forgetfulness!'' —[http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html William Wordsworth (1770-1850), ''The Excursion'' (Book Eighth: "The Parsonage", lines 220-230)]&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue, Cicero insisted, is nothing but nature perfected and developed to its highest point, and there is therefore a resemblance between man and God: "''Est autem virtus nihil aliud quam in se perfecta et ad summum perducta natura; est igitur homini cum deo similitudio''".&lt;ref&gt;See Cicero, ''[[De Legibus]]'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/leg1.shtml Book 1: 25].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cicero’s ''humanitas'' . . . reappeared in the first century in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]’s claim – made in the midst of a lament over Roman bestiality – that man is a sacred thing to man: “''homo res sacra homini''”; and reappeared once more in the eighteenth century in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s call for human autonomy and in [[Voltaire]]’s stern injunction: “Remember your dignity as a man.” In the beginning of his ''[[Meditations]]'', the Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] elaborated a veritable catalog of qualities which, all together, made up the virtues which Cicero had called ''humanitas'' and which the ''philosophes'' hoped they possessed in good measure: modesty, self-control, manliness, beneficence, practicality, generosity, rationality, tolerance, and obedience to the dictates of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''The Enlightenment: The Rise of Modern Paganism'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, [1966] 1995), pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Revival in 18th- and 19th-century Germany==
During the [[Aufklärung]] (or German version of the eighteenth-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the term "''Humanität''" was used to designate the intellectual, physical, and moral formation of "a better [[human being]]" (or [[Humanism]]). It was used, for example, by theologian [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in his ''Briefe zur Beförderung der Humanität'' (''Letters for the Advancement of Humanity''), 1792, and by [[Friedrich Schiller]], among others.&lt;blockquote&gt;Herder's ''Humanität'' is a broad concept he defines variously as the gradual fulfillment of best human potential, the achievement of reason and fairness in all classes and in all affairs of men, and the joint product of the creative actions of legislators, poets, artists, philosophers, inventors, and educators through the ages.&lt;ref&gt;T. J. Reed, ''Light in Germany: Scenes from an Unknown Enlightenment'' (University of Chicago, 2015), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Herder is considered the originator of ethnic nationalism, he was no chauvinist. He maintained that each person loves his own nation, family, language, and customs not because they are better than other peoples' but because they were his. Love for one's own individuality ought to lead to respect for that of others. For Herder, the image of God was imprinted in each human being, along with an internal impulse for self-improvement and growth. Historian William McNeil writes that Herder boldly proclaimed that:&lt;blockquote&gt;each age and every people embody ideals and capacities peculiar to themselves, thus allowing a fuller and more complete expression of the multiform potentialities of humankind than could otherwise occur. Herder expressly denied that one people or civilization was better than another. They were just different, in the same way that the German language was different from the French.&lt;ref&gt;William Hardy McNiell, "Discrepancies among the social sciences", ''Conspectus of History'' 1: 7 (1981): 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Humanitas as benevolence==
In Roman humanism, benevolence (''benevolentia'') was considered a feature of ''Humanitas''. This notion is particularly underscored in the works of Cicero and Seneca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cadenzas: Philosophical Notes for Postmodernism|last=Poma|first=Andrea|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9783319528113|location=Berlin|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, benevolence drives the idea of humaneness and is understood as a feeling either of love or tenderness so that it makes "someone willing to participate, at the level of feeling, in whatever is human."&lt;ref&gt;Poma, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Such participation entails a willingness to engage both in human suffering and joy. This was echoed in the Kantian position on love, where the thinker cited the so-called rational benevolence driven by natural sympathetic joy and pity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kant on Love|last=Rinne|first=Pärttyli|publisher=Walter de Gryuter|year=2018|isbn=9783110543858|location=Berlin|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other thinkers have also discussed benevolence in modern humanism. Max Scheler, for example, used it as an important element in his discourse of sympathy. In one of his works, he linked benevolence and the concept of "fellow-feeling," which allows self-love, self-centred choice, solipsism and egoism" to finally be wholly overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nature of Sympathy|last=Scheler|first=Max|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2008|isbn=9781412806879|location=New Brunswick|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheler specifically equated benevolence with humanitarianism, explaining that these concepts - along with fellow-feeling - embrace all men, "simply because they are men."&lt;ref&gt;Scheler, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Humanitas'' as [[Altruism|benevolence]], is also a cornerstone of the credo of [[Freemasonry]] and constituted one of the bases for its position that nationality and religion do not matter, only universal humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmopolitan Outsiders: Imperial Inclusion, National Exclusion, and the Pan-European Idea, 1900-1930|last=Sorrels|first=Katherine|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=9781349720620|location=Berlin|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some orders of Freemasonry are called "Humanitas".

[[File:Berlin_Universitaet_um_1850.jpg|thumb|The current Humboldt University of Berlin in 1850]]

'''Humboldt's ideal of education''' refers to the holistic education of the arts in conjunction with the respective study direction. This ideal goes back to [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who in the time of the [[Prussian reforms]] relied on a growing educated middle-class and thereby promoted the claim on general education. Today, the term often refers to the central idea of the unity of research and teaching at universities and various other institutes of higher education (in contrast to pure teaching professorships without research obligation).

== Term Reference ==
Humboldt, as head of the ''ministry of culture and public education'' in the ''Prussian Interior Ministry'', incorporated this ideal into educational reforms. In the actual policy it did not extend to the Prussian elementary schools, which also came under the section next to the universities. Occasionally it is therefore alternatively referred to as ''Humboldt's university ideal''.

== Historic Overview ==
''Humboldt's educational ideal'' developed around two central concepts of public education: The concept of the autonomous individual and the concept of [[Cosmopolitanism|world citizenship]]. The university should be a place where autonomous individuals and [[World_citizen#World_citizen|World Citizen]] are produced at or more specifically, produce themselves.

* An autonomous individual is to be an individual who attains self-determination and responsibility through his use of reason.
* "The ''[[Cosmopolitanism|Weltbürgertum]]'' is the collective bond, which connects autonomous individuals, irrespective of their social and cultural socialization: Humboldt says: 'To transform the world as much as possible into one's own person is, in the higher sense of the word, living'. The endeavor shall aim at working through the world comprehensively, and thereby unfold as a subject. To become a [[Cosmopolitanism|citizen of the world]] means, to deal with the big questions of humanity: to seek peace, justice, and care about the exchange of cultures, other gender relationships or another relationship to nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humboldtgesellschaft.de/inhalt.php?name=humboldt Jürgen Hofmann: Welche Bedeutung hat das Humboldt'sche Erbe für unsere Zeit?]&lt;/ref&gt; University education should not be job-focused, but educational training that is independent of economic interests.

[[Academic freedom]] describes independence of the university from outside governmental and economic constraints. The university is to evade government influence. Humboldt demands that the scientific institution of higher education should loose itself "from all forms within the state". Therefore, his concept of university planned, for example, that the University of Berlin should have its own goods in order to finance itself and thereby secure its economic independence. [[Academic freedom]] also demands, next to independence of the university from outside governmental and economic constraints, the independence from within; i.e. free choice of study and free organization of studies. The University should therefore be a place of permanent public exchange between all involved in the scientific process. The integration of their knowledge shall be pursued with the help of philosophy. Philosophy is supposed to represent a kind of basic science, which allows members of different scientific disciplines to bring an exchange of their discovery and to link them together. ''Humboldt's educational ideal'' formed German University History decisively for a long period, albeit it was never realized practically in its entirety or cannot be realized. Great intellectual achievements of German science is linked to it.

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Albert Einstein]] confessed themselves to it.

== Current Situation and Development ==

While during Humboldt's time universities mainly conducted state-organized academic research, there are now in Germany's [[tertiary education]] new forms of higher education, which now all have a scientific mission to research.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Hochschulgesetze der Länder&lt;/ref&gt; The demands of Humboldt's ideal of education can therefore be applied on all German universities.

Critics see in many current reforms, such as the [[Bologna process]], a departure from Humboldt's ideal towards greater occupational studies with economic interests. Furthermore, it is criticized that the [[Academic_freedom|freedom of teaching]] is restricted by the [[Bologna process]].

That said, different educators build their own visions of education onto the concept, what some call conceptions of faith learning integration. This idea is commonly found in [[Christian]] colleges in the United States, and is considered by some to be the essence of [[Christian]] higher education. PABATS, the accrediting association for Bible colleges in the Philippines has also shown interest in faith-learning integration. Christian Colleges of Southeast Asia, Southern Philippines Baptist Theological Seminary, Halls of Life Bible College, Davao Bible College and Koinonia Theological Seminary are now practicing faith and learning integration.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Interdisciplinarity''' or interdisciplinary studies involves the combining of two or more [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] into one activity (e.g., a research project).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M|date=1995|title=Fruits, Salads, and Smoothies: A Working definition of Interdisciplinarity|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23767672|journal=The Journal of educational Thought (JET)/revue de La Pensée Éducative|volume=29(2)|pages=121-128|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws knowledge from several other fields like sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics etc.  It is about creating something by thinking across boundaries. It is related to an ''[[interdiscipline]]'' or an ''interdisciplinary field,'' which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between [[Outline of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] or [[School of thought|schools of thought]], as new needs and professions emerge. Large [[engineering]] teams are usually interdisciplinary, as a [[power station]] or [[mobile phone]] or other project requires the melding of several specialties. However, the term "interdisciplinary" is sometimes confined to academic settings.

The term ''interdisciplinary'' is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study. Interdisciplinarity involves researchers, students, and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought, professions, or technologies—along with their specific perspectives—in the pursuit of a common task. The [[epidemiology]] of [[HIV/AIDS]] or [[global warming]] requires understanding of diverse disciplines to solve complex problems. ''Interdisciplinary'' may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions, for example, [[women's studies]] or ethnic area studies. Interdisciplinarity can likewise be applied to complex subjects that can only be understood by combining the perspectives of two or more fields.

The [[adjective]] ''interdisciplinary'' is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand, including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines.  For example, the subject of [[land use]] may appear differently when examined by different disciplines, for instance, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[geography]], and [[politics]].

==Development==
Although “interdisciplinary” and “interdisciplinarity” are frequently viewed as twentieth century terms, the concept has historical antecedents, most notably [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref name="ausburg"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ausburg, Tanya|title=Becoming Interdisciplinary: An Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies|edition=2nd |location= New York|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julie Thompson Klein]] attests that "the roots of the concepts lie in a number of ideas that resonate through modern discourse—the ideas of a unified science, general knowledge, synthesis and the integration of knowledge",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klein, Julie Thompson|title=Interdisciplinarity: History, Theory, and Practice|location=Detroit|publisher=Wayne State University|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Giles Gunn says that [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historians]] and [[Playwright|dramatists]] took elements from other realms of knowledge (such as [[medicine]] or [[philosophy]]) to further understand their own material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gunn, Giles|chapter=Interdisciplinary Studies|editor=Gibaldi, J.|title= Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Language and Literatures|location=New York|publisher=Modern Language Association|year=1992|pp=239–240|isbn= 978-0873523851}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of [[Roman roads]] required men who understood [[surveying]], [[material science]], [[logistics]] and several other disciplines. Any broadminded humanist project involves interdisciplinarity, and history shows a crowd of cases, as seventeenth-century Leibniz's task to create a system of universal justice, which required linguistics, economics, management, ethics, law philosophy, politics, and even sinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=José Andrés-Gallego|title=Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz's Universal (Chinese) Dream|journal=Journal of Mixed Methods Research|volume=29|issue=2|year=2015|pages=118–132|url=http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract|doi=10.1177/1558689813515332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise from a shared conviction that the traditional disciplines are unable or unwilling to address an important problem. For example, social science disciplines such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] paid little attention to the social analysis of [[technology]] throughout most of the twentieth century. As a result, many social scientists with interests in technology have joined [[science, technology and society]] programs, which are typically staffed by scholars drawn from numerous disciplines. They may also arise from new research developments, such as [[nanotechnology]], which cannot be addressed without combining the approaches of two or more disciplines. Examples include [[quantum information processing]], an amalgamation of [[quantum physics]] and [[computer science]], and [[bioinformatics]], combining [[molecular biology]] with computer science. [[Sustainable development]] as a research area deals with problems requiring analysis and synthesis across economic, social and environmental spheres; often an integration of multiple social and natural science disciplines. Interdisciplinary research is also key to the study of health sciences, for example in studying optimal solutions to diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J.S. Edge|author2=S.J. Hoffman|author3=C.L. Ramirez|author4=S.J. Goldie|year=2013|title=Research and Development Priorities to Achieve the "Grand Convergence": An Initial Scan of Priority Research Areas for Public Health, Implementation Science and Innovative Financing for Neglected Diseases: Working Paper for the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health|location=London, UK|publisher=The Lancet|url=http://globalhealth2035.org/sites/default/files/working-papers/goldie-team-rd-cih-working-paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions of higher education offer accredited degree programs in Interdisciplinary Studies.

At another level, interdisciplinarity is seen as a remedy to the harmful effects of excessive specialization and isolation in [[information silo]]s. On some views, however, interdisciplinarity is entirely indebted to those who specialize in one field of study—that is, without specialists, interdisciplinarians would have no information and no leading experts to consult. Others place the focus of interdisciplinarity on the need to transcend disciplines, viewing excessive specialization as problematic both epistemologically and politically. When interdisciplinary collaboration or research results in new solutions to problems, much information is given back to the various disciplines involved. Therefore, both disciplinarians and interdisciplinarians may be seen in complementary relation to one another.

==Barriers==
Because most participants in interdisciplinary ventures were trained in traditional disciplines, they must learn to appreciate differing of perspectives and methods. For example, a discipline that places more emphasis on quantitative "rigor" may produce practitioners who think of themselves (and their discipline) as "more scientific" than others; in turn, colleagues in "softer" disciplines may associate quantitative approaches with an inability to grasp the broader dimensions of a problem. An interdisciplinary program may not succeed if its members remain stuck in their disciplines (and in disciplinary attitudes). On the other hand, and from the disciplinary perspective, much interdisciplinary work may be seen as "soft", lacking in rigor, or ideologically motivated; these beliefs place barriers in the career paths of those who choose interdisciplinary work.  For example, interdisciplinary grant applications are often refereed by [[peer review]]ers drawn from established [[Academic discipline|disciplines]]; not surprisingly, interdisciplinary researchers may experience difficulty getting funding for their research. In addition, untenured researchers know that, when they seek [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] and [[tenure]], it is likely that some of the evaluators will lack commitment to interdisciplinarity. They may fear that making a commitment to interdisciplinary research will increase the risk of being denied tenure.

Interdisciplinary programs may fail if they are not given sufficient autonomy. For example, interdisciplinary faculty are usually recruited to a [[joint appointment]], with responsibilities in both an interdisciplinary program (such as [[women's studies]]) and a traditional discipline (such as [[history]]). If the traditional discipline makes the tenure decisions, new interdisciplinary faculty will be hesitant to commit themselves fully to interdisciplinary work. Other barriers include the generally disciplinary orientation of most scholarly journals, leading to the perception, if not the fact, that interdisciplinary research is hard to publish. In addition, since traditional budgetary practices at most universities channel resources through the disciplines, it becomes difficult to account for a given scholar or teacher's salary and time. During periods of budgetary contraction, the natural tendency to serve the primary constituency (i.e., students majoring in the traditional discipline) makes resources scarce for teaching and research comparatively far from the center of the discipline as traditionally understood. For these same reasons, the introduction of new interdisciplinary programs is often resisted because it is perceived as a competition for diminishing funds.

Due to these and other barriers, interdisciplinary research areas are strongly motivated to become disciplines themselves. If they succeed, they can establish their own research funding programs and make their own tenure and promotion decisions. In so doing, they lower the risk of entry. Examples of former interdisciplinary research areas that have become disciplines, many of them named for their parent disciplines, include [[neuroscience]], [[cybernetics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[biomedical engineering]]. These new fields are occasionally referred to as "interdisciplines". On the other hand, even though interdisciplinary activities are now a focus of attention for institutions promoting learning and teaching, as well as organizational and social entities concerned with education, they are practically facing complex barriers, serious challenges and criticism. The most important obstacles and challenges faced by interdisciplinary activities in the past two decades can be divided into "professional", "organizational", and "cultural" obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali|title=Interdisciplinary Higher Education; Criticism, Challenges and Obstacles|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=researchday|date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary studies and studies of interdisciplinarity==
An initial distinction should be made between interdisciplinary studies, which can be found spread across the academy today, and the study of interdisciplinarity, which involves a much smaller group of researchers. The former is instantiated in thousands of research centers across the US and the world. The latter has one US organization, the Association for Interdisciplinary Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.units.muohio.edu/aisorg/|title=Association for Interdisciplinary Studies Homepage - Association for Interdisciplinary Studies - Oakland University|website=www.units.muohio.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 1979), two international organizations, the International Network of Inter- and Transdisciplinarity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inidtd.org/|title=INIT-Home|website=www.inidtd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 2010) and the Philosophy of/as Interdisciplinarity Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pin-net.gatech.edu/|title=PIN / HOME|website=pin-net.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 2009), and one research institute devoted to the theory and practice of interdisciplinarity, the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity at the University of North Texas (founded in 2008). As of September 1, 2014, the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity has ceased to exist. This is the result of administrative decisions at the University of North Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=University of Texas|title=Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity|url=https://webarchive.library.unt.edu/unt/csid/20140911224746/http://csid.unt.edu/news.html#closing|website=University of Texas|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''interdisciplinary study''' is an academic program or process seeking to synthesize broad [[perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]], knowledge, skills, interconnections, and [[epistemology]] in an educational setting. Interdisciplinary programs may be founded in order to facilitate the study of subjects which have some coherence, but which cannot be adequately understood from a single disciplinary perspective (for example, women's studies or [[medievalism|medieval studies]]). More rarely, and at a more advanced level, interdisciplinarity may itself become the focus of study, in a critique of institutionalized disciplines' ways of segmenting knowledge.

In contrast, '''studies of interdisciplinarity''' raise to self-consciousness questions about how interdisciplinarity works, the nature and history of disciplinarity, and the future of knowledge in [[post-industrial society]]. Researchers at the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity have made the distinction between philosophy 'of' and 'as' interdisciplinarity, the former identifying a new, discrete area within philosophy that raises epistemological and metaphysical questions about the status of interdisciplinary thinking, with the latter pointing toward a philosophical practice that is sometimes called 'field philosophy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/experiments-in-field-philosophy/?_r=0 | title=Experiments of Field Psychology | work=Opinionator | date=November 23, 2010 | accessdate=July 30, 2016 | author=Frodeman, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frodeman | first1 = Robert | last2 = Briggle | first2 = Adam | last3 = Holbrook | first3 = J. Britt | year = 2012 | title = Philosophy in the Age of Neoliberalism | url = | journal = Social Epistemology | volume = 26 | issue = 3–4| pages = 311–330 | doi = 10.1080/02691728.2012.722701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most common complaint regarding interdisciplinary programs, by supporters and detractors alike, is the lack of synthesis—that is, students are provided with multiple disciplinary perspectives, but are not given effective guidance in resolving the conflicts and achieving a coherent view of the subject. Others have argued that the very idea of synthesis or integration of disciplines presupposes questionable politico-epistemic commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holbrook | first1 = J. Britt | year = | title = What is interdisciplinary communication? Reflections on the very idea of disciplinary integration | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 190| issue = | pages = 1865–1879| doi = 10.1007/s11229-012-0179-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of interdisciplinary programs feel that the ambition is simply unrealistic, given the knowledge and intellectual maturity of all but the exceptional undergraduate; some defenders concede the difficulty, but insist that cultivating interdisciplinarity as a habit of mind, even at that level, is both possible and essential to the education of informed and engaged citizens and leaders capable of analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing information from multiple sources in order to render reasoned decisions.

While much has been written on the philosophy and promise of interdisciplinarity in academic programs and professional practice, social scientists are increasingly interrogating academic discourses on interdisciplinarity, as well as how interdisciplinarity actually works—and does not—in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barry, A.|author2=G.

=== Politics of interdisciplinary studies ===

Since 1998, there has been an ascendancy in the value of interdisciplinary research and teaching and a growth in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded at U.S. universities classified as multi- or interdisciplinary studies.  The number of interdisciplinary bachelor's degrees awarded annually rose from 7,000 in 1973 to 30,000 a year by 2005 according to data from the National Center of Educational Statistics (NECS). In addition, educational leaders from the Boyer Commission to Carnegie's President [[Vartan Gregorian]] to [[Alan I. Leshner]], CEO of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] have advocated for interdisciplinary rather than disciplinary approaches to problem solving in the 21st century.  This has been echoed by federal funding agencies, particularly the [[National Institutes of Health]] under the direction of [[Elias Zerhouni]], who has advocated that grant proposals be framed more as interdisciplinary collaborative projects than single researcher, single discipline ones.

At the same time, many thriving longstanding bachelor's in interdisciplinary studies programs in existence for 30 or more years, have been closed down, in spite of healthy enrollment. Examples include Arizona International (formerly part of the [[University of Arizona]]), the School of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Miami University]], and the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Wayne State University]]; others such as the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Appalachian State University]], and [[George Mason University]]'s [[New Century College]], have been cut back. Stuart Henry{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} has seen this trend as part of the [[hegemony]] of the disciplines in their attempt to recolonize the experimental knowledge production of otherwise marginalized fields of inquiry. This is due to threat perceptions seemingly based on the ascendancy of interdisciplinary studies against traditional academia.

==Historical examples==
There are many examples of when a particular idea, almost on the same period, arises in different disciplines. One case is the shift from the approach of focusing on "specialized segments of attention" (adopting one particular perspective), to the idea of "instant sensory awareness of the whole", an attention to the "total field", a "sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity", an "integral idea of structure and configuration". This has happened in painting (with [[cubism]]), physics, poetry, communication and [[educational theory]]. According to [[Marshall McLuhan]], this [[paradigm shift]] was due to the passage from an era shaped by [[mechanization]], which brought sequentiality, to the era shaped by the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall McLuhan]] (1964) ''[[Understanding Media]]'', p.13 {{cite web |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011132326/http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to simplify and defend the concept ==
An article in the ''Social Science Journal''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1997|title=Ten cheers for interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=|journal=Social Science Journal|volume=34|pages=201–216|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0362-3319(97)90051-3|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to provide a simple, common-sense, definition of interdisciplinarity, bypassing the difficulties of defining that concept and obviating the need for such related concepts as [[transdisciplinarity]], [[pluridisciplinarity]], and [[multidisciplinarity]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"To begin with, a discipline can be conveniently defined as any comparatively self-contained and isolated domain of human experience which possesses its own community of experts. Interdisciplinarity is best seen as bringing together distinctive components of two or more disciplines. In academic discourse, interdisciplinarity typically applies to four realms: knowledge, research, education, and theory. Interdisciplinary knowledge involves familiarity with components of two or more disciplines. Interdisciplinary research combines components of two or more disciplines in the search or creation of new knowledge, operations, or artistic expressions. Interdisciplinary education merges components of two or more disciplines in a single program of instruction. Interdisciplinary theory takes interdisciplinary knowledge, research, or education as its main objects of study."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In turn, interdisciplinary ''richness'' of any two instances of knowledge, research, or education can be ranked by weighing four variables: number of disciplines involved, the "distance" between them, the novelty of any particular combination, and their extent of integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1995|title=Fruits, Salads, and Smoothies:  A Working Definition of Interdisciplinarity|url=http://www.uta.edu/faculty/repko/INTS_4391/SMOOTHIE.htm|journal=Journal of Educational Thought|volume=29|pages=119–126|issue=2|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdisciplinary knowledge and research are important because:
#"Creativity often requires interdisciplinary knowledge.
#Immigrants often make important contributions to their new field.
#Disciplinarians often commit errors which can be best detected by people familiar with two or more disciplines.
#Some worthwhile topics of research fall in the interstices among the traditional disciplines.
#Many intellectual, social, and practical problems require interdisciplinary approaches.
#Interdisciplinary knowledge and research serve to remind us of the unity-of-knowledge ideal.
#Interdisciplinarians enjoy greater flexibility in their research.
#More so than narrow disciplinarians, interdisciplinarians often treat themselves to the intellectual equivalent of traveling in new lands.
#Interdisciplinarians may help breach communication gaps in the modern academy, thereby helping to mobilize its enormous intellectual resources in the cause of greater social rationality and justice.
#By bridging fragmented disciplines, interdisciplinarians might play a role in the defense of academic freedom."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Quotations ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The modern mind divides, specializes, thinks in categories: the Greek instinct was the opposite, to take the widest view, to see things as an organic whole .... It was arete that the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic games]] were designed to test the arete of the whole man, not a merely specialized skill .... The great event was the [[pentathlon]], if you won this, you were a man. Needless to say, the Marathon race was never heard of until modern times: the Greeks would have regarded it as a monstrosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Greeks|last = Kitto|first = H.D.F.|publisher = Penguin|year = 1957|isbn = 0140135219|location = Middlesex|pages = 173–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Previously, men could be divided simply into the learned and the ignorant, those more or less the one, and those more or less the other. But your specialist cannot be brought in under either of these two categories. He is not learned, for he is formally ignorant of all that does not enter into his specialty; but neither is he ignorant, because he is 'a scientist,' and 'knows' very well his own tiny portion of the universe. We shall have to say that he is a learned ignoramus, which is a very serious matter, as it implies that he is a person who is ignorant, not in the fashion of the ignorant man, but with all the petulance of one who is learned in his own special line."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Revolt of the Masses|last = Ortega y Gasset|first = José|publisher = New American Library|year = 1932|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is the custom among those who are called "practical" men to condemn any man capable of a wide survey as a visionary: no man is thought worthy of a voice in politics unless he ignores or does not know nine tenths of the most important relevant facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://drnissani.net/MNISSANI/pagepub/NR.html|title=Lives in the Balance: the Cold War and American Politics, 1945-1991|last=Bertrand Russell, cited in: Nissani, M.|first=|first2=|publisher=Hollowbrook|year=1992|isbn=978-0893416591|location=|pages=|chapter-url=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Education Bill sought to regulate appointments and conditions of teachers. Salaries of teachers were to be paid through the treasury. There was a provision of takeover of management of educational institutions, which arguably violated the constitution.&lt;ref name="SCR-Das"&gt;''In the premises, they may, in our opinion, legitimately complain that so far as the grants under Art. 337 are concerned, the provisions of the clauses of the Bill mentioned in question 2 do in substance and effect infringe their fundamental rights under Art. 30(1) and are to that extent void.'' Paragraph 44 ''But no rule to be framed under clause 36(2)(c) can nullify the constitutional infirmity of clause 3(5) read with clause 20 which is calculated to infringe the fundamental rights of minority communities in respect of recognised schools to be established after the commencement of the said Bill.''

The '''Kharkiv school of psychology''' (''Харьківска психологічна школа'') is a tradition of developmental psychological research conducted in the paradigm of [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s "sociocultural theory of mind" and [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|Leontiev's]] psychological [[activity theory]].

== Kharkiv group: the beginning of the school ==
The school was founded by its leader [[Alexander Luria]], who—along with [[Mark Lebedinsky]] and [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|Alexei Leont'ev]]—moved from Moscow to [[Kharkiv]], the capital of Soviet [[Ukraine]] at that time. The core of the group was formed by Luria, Lebedinsky and Leontiev and their Moscow colleagues, [[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]] and Bozhovich, along with a group of such local researchers as Gal'perin, [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]], [[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]], Lukov, Khomenko, Kontsevaya, Rozenblyum, etc. The group conducted a wide range of psychological studies on concept formation in children, voluntary and involuntary memory, development of visual-operational thinking, voluntary behaviour, and reasoning, the role of orientation in thought and activity, etc. that laid the foundation for the psychological [[activity theory|theory of activity]].

== P. I. Zinchenko and the Kharkiv school of developmental psychology ==
In the postwar period, the scientific work of the school developed under informal leadership of [[Pyotr Zinchenko]] in the field of the psychology of memory. The major achievement of the school is the systematic analysis of the phenomenon of [[involuntary memory]] from the standpoint of the [[activity theory|activity approach]] in psychology. Soviet studies of involuntary memory carried out by the representatives of the Kharkiv school influenced psychological research both nationally and worldwide (e.g., memory research by [[Ann Brown|A. Brown]], Murphy, Meacham, Sophian, Hagen, etc.).

The [[information processing]] or [[engineering psychology]] approach to memory and cognition was developed in the research by Zinchenko, Bocharova, Nevel'skii, Repkina. On the other hand, research on the role of involuntary memory in education and memory in thinking and personality development was conducted by Sereda, Ivanova, and associates.

Another major area of research is the theory and practice of developmental teaching (or the system of El'konin-Davydov) associated with such representatives of the Kharkiv school as Repkin, Bodanskii, Dusavitskii.

'''MaMaMedia''' was an educational consulting firm run by [[Idit Harel Caperton]], specializing in applications of [[constructionist learning]] theory.

Founded in 1995, MaMaMedia.com was designed to foster [[digital literacy]] skills for children using constructionist theory principles.
It was awarded the [[GII Award]] for Education in 1999 "for helping kids become life-long learners".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/about/websites.phtml FinAid Reviews and Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The site provided web users with a range of "playful learning" activities and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MaMaMedia.com helps families explore Web|publisher=The Rock River Times|url=http://rockrivertimes.com/1993/07/01/mamamediacom-helps-families-explore-web|date=July 1, 1993|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1996 and 2000, the company developed and grew in the emerging Internet and print marketplaces, publishing the first print [[magazine]] for children about the Internet, ''MaMaMedia: A Kid's Guide to the Net''.

[[Image:Mathlete.jpg|thumb|right|High School mathletes at a Texas Math and Science Coaches Association ([[TMSCA]]) Math Tournament]]

A '''mathlete''' is a person who competes in [[List of mathematics competitions|mathematics competitions]] at any level or any age. More specifically, a Mathlete is a student who participates in any of the [[Mathcounts|MATHCOUNTS]] programs, as Mathlete is a [[Registered trademark symbol|registered trademark]] of the MATHCOUNTS Foundation in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/761/61/mathlete-76161336.html|title=MATHLETE Trademark of MATHCOUNTS Foundation - Registration Number 2754939 - Serial Number 76161336 :: Justia Trademarks|website=trademarks.justia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[mathematics]] and [[sportsperson|athlete]]. 

Top Mathletes from MATHCOUNTS often go on to compete in the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination|AIME]], [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad|USAMO]], and [[American Regions Mathematics League|ARML]] competitions in the United States. Those in other countries generally participate in national olympiads to qualify for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]].

Participants in [[World Math Day]] also are commonly referred to as mathletes.

==Mathletic Competitions==
The Putnam Exam: The [[William Lowell Putnam Competition]] is the preeminent undergraduate level mathletic competition in the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Administered by the [[Mathematical Association of America]], students compete as individuals and as teams (as chosen by their Institution) for scholarships and team prize money. The exam is administered on the first Saturday in December.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.scu.edu/putnam/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathletic Off-season Conditioning==
The academic off-season (traditionally referred to as "summer") can be especially difficult on mathletes, though various training regimens have been proposed to keep mathletic ability at its peak. Publications such as the [[Mathematical Association of America|MAA's]] ''[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]'' and the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS's]] ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' are widely read to maintain and hone mathematical ability. Some [[professor|coaches]] suggest seeking research internships or grants, many of which are funded by the [[National Science Foundation]].

At higher levels, mathletes can obtain funding from host institutions to work on summer research projects. For example, the [[University of Delaware]] offers the Groups Exploring the Mathematical Sciences project (GEMS project) to first year graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.udel.edu/research/GEMS/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930073442/http://www.math.udel.edu/research/GEMS/index.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The students act as the principal investigator and work with an undergraduate research assistant and a faculty adviser who will oversee their summer research.

The '''Modern Schools''', also called '''Ferrer Schools''', were [[school]]s in the [[United States]], established in the early twentieth century, that were modeled after the [[Escuela Moderna]] of [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], the Spanish educator and [[anarchism|anarchist]]. They were an important part of the anarchist, [[Anarchistic free school|free schooling]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[labor movement]]s in the U.S., intended to educate the working-classes from a [[secular]], [[class-conscious]] perspective. The Modern Schools imparted day-time academic classes for children and night-time continuing-education lectures for adults.

The first, and most notable, of the American Modern Schools was founded in New York City, in 1911, two years after [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]]’s execution for [[sedition]] in monarchist Spain on 18 October 1909, and housed children of strikers from the [[1912 Lawrence textile strike]] and [[1913 Paterson silk strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=May Day Parades By 50,000 Workers |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 2, 1913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly called the '''Ferrer Center''', it was founded by notable anarchists — including [[Leonard Dalton Abbott|Leonard Abbott]], [[Alexander Berkman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], and [[Emma Goldman]] — first meeting on [[St. Mark's Place]], in Manhattan’s [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], but twice moved elsewhere, first within lower Manhattan, then to 103 East 107th Street in [[Harlem]]. The Ferrer Center opened with only nine students, one being the son of [[Margaret Sanger]], the [[contraceptives]]-rights activist. [[Man Ray]] enrolled in the autumn of 1912 as a night-time continuing-education student&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod&gt;[[Francis Naumann]]; &lt;cite&gt;[http://tfaoi.org/aa/3aa/3aa655b.htm Conversion to Modernism: The Early Work of Man Ray]&lt;/cite&gt;; Rutgers University Press; {{ISBN|0-8135-3148-9}} (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWtdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Modern|title=Man Ray: Writings on Art|first=Jennifer|last=Mundy|date=1 March 2016|publisher=Getty Publications|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://graphicarts.princeton.edu/2017/08/27/the-modern-school-and-ferrer-colony/|title=The Modern School and Ferrer Colony|author=|date=27 August 2017|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6X_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=Modern|title=The Modern School Movement: Anarchism and Education in the United States|first=Paul|last=Avrich|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/ray-bio.htm|title=Man Ray - Bio|author=|date=|website=phillipscollection.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trompeteler.com/2013/01/man-ray-and-the-societe-anonyme/|title=Man Ray and the Société Anonyme, New York -|author=|date=|website=trompeteler.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/07/arts/art-review-emmanuel-radnitzky-before-he-was-man-ray.html|title=ART REVIEW; Emmanuel Radnitzky, Before He Was Man Ray|first=Grace|last=Glueck|date=7 March 2003|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking life drawing classes supervised by [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/man_ray1.html|title=History of Art: Man Ray|author=|date=|website=all-art.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollistaggart.com/artists/man-ray|title=Man Ray|author=|date=|website=Hollis Taggart Galleries|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/3aa/3aa432.htm|title=Robert Henri and His Influence|author=|date=|website=tfaoi.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304070304577394304016454714|title=The Surreal Selling of Man Ray|first=Kelly|last=Crow|date=11 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gvshp.org/blog/2016/09/02/man-ray-the-darling-of-the-revolutionary-set-art-revolution-that-is/|title=Man Ray:  The darling of the revolutionary set (art revolution that is)|author=|date=|website=gvshp.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=110333|title=Man Ray (photographer; painter/draughtsman; American (USA); Male; 1890 - 1976)|author=|date=|website=British Museum|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWtdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Ray|title=Man Ray: Writings on Art|first=Jennifer|last=Mundy|date=1 March 2016|publisher=Getty Publications|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRR8eWzRhbYC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Ray|title=Anarchy &amp; Culture: The Aesthetic Politics of Modernism|first=David|last=Weir|date=1 April 1997|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcTmuSTJGL4C&amp;pg=PA223&amp;lpg=PA223&amp;dq=Ray|title=Becoming Modern: The Life of Mina Loy|first=Carolyn|last=Burke|date=25 July 1996|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-artists/man-ray.htm|title=Man Ray: Dada Artist, Surrealist Photographer|author=|date=|website=visual-arts-cork.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/18/nyregion/art-pre-abstract-expressionist-artist.html|title=Pre-Abstract Expressionist Artist|author=|date=18 September 1988|website=The New York Times|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/unholy-trinity|title=The unholy trinity  - Tate|author=|date=|website=tate.org.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1912, the school’s principal was the philosopher [[Will Durant]], who also taught there. Besides Berkman and Goldman, the Ferrer Center faculty included the [[Ashcan School]] painters [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]], and its guest lecturers included writers and political activists such as Margaret Sanger, [[Jack London]], and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''The Modern School Movement'', AK Press (2005), p.212: At the Ferrer Center, Berkman was called “The Pope”, Goldman was called “The Red Queen”.&lt;/ref&gt; Student Magda Schoenwetter, recalled that the school used [[Montessori]] methods and equipment, and emphasised academic freedom rather than fixed subjects, such as spelling and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', “Interview with Magda Schoenwetter”, AK Press (2005), {{ISBN|1-904859-27-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904859-27-7}}, p.230: “What everybody is yowling about now — freedom in education — we had then, though I still can’t spell or do multiplication.”&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1914, radical anarchists who frequented the Ferrer Center, and loosely associated with its adult education program, plotted to bomb the mansion of tycoon industrialist [[John D. Rockefeller]]. On failing to enter the Rockefeller estate, they took the bomb back to the Lexington Avenue apartment of [[Louise Berger]] (a school habitué and a Latvian anarchist who edited Emma Goldman's ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]''), where it exploded, killing four people, including three of the bombers, and wounding many others, and brought political notoriety upon the Ferrer Center.&lt;ref name=Avrich&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''The Modern School Movement''.

==Other Modern Schools==
After the 4 July 1914 [[Lexington Avenue bombing]], the police investigated and several times raided the Ferrer Center and other labor and anarchist organisations in New York City.&lt;ref name=Avrich/&gt; Acknowledging the urban danger to their school, the organizers bought 68 acres (275,000 m²) in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey]], and moved there in 1914, becoming the center of the [[Stelton Colony]].&lt;ref name="ic.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ic.org/wiki/ferrer-colony-stelton/|title=Ferrer Colony, Stelton - Fellowship for Intentional Community|author=|date=|website=ic.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, beyond New York City, the [[Ferrer Colony and Modern School]] was founded (ca. 1910–1915) in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]] as a Modern School-based community, that endured some forty years.

In 1930, the Mohegan Colony&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z8mdUYp-6gC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=Mohegan|title=Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America|first=Paul|last=Avrich|date=1 April 2018|publisher=AK Press|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RZy-l3nHfoC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Mohegan|title=The Communal Experience: Anarchist and Mystical Communities in Twentieth Century America|first=Laurence R.|last=Veysey|date=1 November 1978|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EatsyPj4fusC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=Mohegan|title=Utopias and Utopians: An Historical Dictionary|first=R.

In 1933, James and Nellie Dick, who earlier had been principals of the Stelton Modern School, founded the Modern School in [[Lakewood, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=Avrich/&gt; which survived the original Modern School, the Ferrer Center, becoming the final surviving such school, lasting until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationrevolution.org/aerogramme11.html AERO-GRAMME #11: The Alternative Education Resource Organization Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929213939/http://www.educationrevolution.org/aerogramme11.html |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Modern School'' magazine==
''The Modern School'' magazine originally began as a newsletter for parents, when the school was in New York City, printed with the manual [[printing press]] used in teaching printing as a profession. After moving to the Stelton Colony, New Jersey, the magazine’s content expanded to poetry, prose, art, and [[Anarchism and education|libertarian education]] articles; the cover emblem and interior graphics were designed by [[Rockwell Kent]]. Artists and writers, among them [[Hart Crane]] and [[Wallace Stevens]], praised ''The Modern School'' as “the most beautifully printed magazine in existence.”{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7135">In [[education]], '''narrative evaluation''' is a form of performance measurement and feedback which can be used as an alternative or supplement to [[grade (education)|grading]].  Narrative evaluations generally consist of several paragraphs of written text about a student's individual performance and course work. The style and form of narrative evaluations vary significantly among the educational institutions using them, and they are sometimes combined with other performance metrics, including [[Grading in the United States|letter and number grades]] and pass/fail designations.

In the [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]] and [[natural science]] a '''predoctoral fellow''' ('''pre-doc''') refers to a researcher who has a [[bachelor's degree]], but not a [[doctorate]].  As the name implies, predoctoral fellows often use their time as a fellow to develop their skills and résumé before applying to [[graduate school]]. They differ from lab managers or technicians in that they primarily pursue research, rather than maintain the day-to-day function of a lab, and may have external funding to support their research or educational activities, but typically are also reliant on the support of a research mentor whose lab they work in.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence}}

In [[Mathematics]] and some Science disciplines, typically a pre-doc is somebody already registered in a Ph.D. program at a host university to work together with a professor in a different topic with respect to his/her topic.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54433">'''Privacy in education''' refers to the broad area of ideologies, practices, and legislation that involve the privacy rights of individuals in the education system. Concepts that are commonly associated with privacy in education include the [[expectation of privacy]], the [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]] (FERPA), the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA). The majority of privacy in education concerns are prevalent to the protection of student data, such as educational records and other personal information, both inside and outside the traditional classroom setting as well as the privacy and confidentiality of medical records. Many scholars are engaging in an academic discussion that covers the scope of students’ privacy rights, from student in K-12 and even higher education, and the management of student data in an age of rapid access and dissemination of information. 

== Expectation of Privacy ==
"[[Expectation of privacy]]," similar to the "[[right to privacy]]," is a phrase that describes the natural desire of humans to maintain their sense of privacy. There is currently no legal definition in the American law that explicitly grants humans the right to privacy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott-Hayward|first=C. S.|date=2015|title=Does Privacy Require Secrecy? Societal Expectations of Privacy in the Digital Age|url=|journal=American Journal of Criminal Law|volume=43(1)|pages=19–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] is utilized by people in court cases to defend themselves from actions that involve certain infringements upon their privacy, such as searches that require warrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, over the years, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has found it difficult to determine an impartial non-biased meaning for "expectation of privacy" because there are too many subjective variables to consider.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Student Expectation of Privacy ==
In line with the general meaning of "expectation of privacy," student expectation of privacy refers to a student's inherent right to privacy in the school system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=A. A.|date=2001|title=Do Children Have Privacy Rights in the Classroom?|url=|journal=Studies In Philosophy &amp; Education|volume=20(3)|pages=245–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of student expectation of privacy, especially in the pre-collegiate levels, include the protection of a student's academic record from being viewed by anyone other than the academic instructor, the student's parents or guardians, and the students themselves. There have been many legal cases regarding the privacy concerns of pupils' academic records, for example the [[Owasso Independent School District v. Falvo]] that was handled by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. This particular case began in October 1998 when Kristja J. Falvo filed a lawsuit against the Owasso Independent School District on the premise that the grading practice employed in her children's classroom, peer grading, was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and of FERPA. Additionally, peer grading embarrassed her children in front of their peers, which could be interpreted as a violation of a student's expectation of privacy in the classroom. When the case reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]], it was ruled in October 2000 that peer grading was not a violation of the constitutional Fourteenth Amendment but was, in fact, a violation of FERPA. The Tenth Circuit judges reasoned so by closely interpreting the statue in FERPA about privacy protection of "educational records." Since it was agreed upon that teacher grade books were considered "educational records," the Tenth Circuit decided that anything that went into these grade books, including student grades written on student work, were also considered "educational records" and thus subject to FERPA's privacy protection policies. After the court decision was released, peer grading practices were banned in school districts within the Tenth Circuit regional borders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dinger|first=D. R.|date=2001|title=Johnny saw my test score, so I'm suing my teacher: Falvo v. Owasso Independent School District, peer grading, and a student's right to privacy under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act|url=|journal=Journal of Law &amp; Education|volume=30(4)|pages=575–626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many citizens and scholars were opposed to the Tenth Circuit's decision, and the case ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001. In 2002, the Supreme Court Justices officially ruled that peer grading was not a violation of FERPA. They reasoned that student grades on student work were not considered "educational records" until the teacher had physically recorded the grades into a grade book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2001/00-1073|title=Owasso Independent School District No. I-011 v. Falvo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, peer grading returned as a common grading practice in classrooms across the United States.

Other examples of student expectation of privacy include the right of children to withhold personal information from teachers within in a traditional classroom setting. Such topic remains as a contentious educational privacy concern in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some argue that teachers should know more information about students in order to help support them in their academic endeavors. Others argue that teachers should refrain from prying into the personal lives of children because, like adults, children should have the right to privacy and determine the amount of information that they reveal to teachers. Still others make the claim that children are too young to make this decision for themselves and should consult their parents prior to revealing anything personal to their teachers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Student Educational Records ==
Student educational records, according to the FERPA statue, is defined as "those records, files, documents, and other materials which--(i) contain information directly related to a student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ===
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 was propelled by New York Senator James Buckley who promoted the importance of protection and privacy of educational records of students who attended primary and secondary schooling. As a federal legislation, FERPA grants students under the age of 18 and their parents the right to manage their educational records, which may include data about their academic performance, medical information, behavioral analysis, and more. Thus, when parents or guardians feel that their children's educational records have been exposed to the public in some way, they are able to file claims against the school district as a violation of FERPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=Kent M.|date=2001|title=Family-Friendly FERPA Policies: Affirming Parental Partnerships|url=|journal=New Directions For Student Services|volume=94|pages=39–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For students over the age of 18, particularly those enrolled in postsecondary education institutions, FERPA can be vague and unclear about the disclosure of educational records to parents. Since individuals aged 18 and over are recognized as adults by the law, FERPA separates students in postsecondary education and their parents in terms of access to educational records such as health and drug records.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Thomas R.|date=Summer 2008|title=Navigating State and Federal Student Privacy Laws to Design Educationally Sound Parental Notice Policies.|url=|journal=New Directions For Student Services|volume=122|pages=81-104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Baker, many controversial issues may arise. For example, Baker writes that "FERPA regulation 99.31(a)(8) allows disclosure to parents without the student's prior written authorization if the student is 'dependent' on the parents as defined by the Internal Revenue Code."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, there may be circumstances under which financially dependent students would not want their private records accessed by their parents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, FERPA authorizes the release to parents or guardians of information about recorded drug or alcohol use by students under the age of 21. If the underage and illegal drug or alcohol use resulted in legitimate concerns and disciplinary action, school administrators can notify and disclose details to parents without the students' permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Teressa L.|date=2014|title=Student Privacy Rights--History, Owasso, and FERPA.|url=|journal=Journal Of Higher Education Theory &amp; Practice|volume=14(4)|pages=34-47|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common Core ===

As the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]] are being developed and implemented in schools across the United States, some academics are bringing awareness to the potential privacy concerns of student data and educational records. According to Stacie Hunt, the Common Core system creates a large student database that keeps track of student performance and information from pre-K to college and even beyond. Federal government and other agencies are able to gain access to this database, analyze student data records, and sell pertinent information to the schools and districts overall. This creates a privacy concern about student data being spread and utilized by third-parties without the students', or their parents', explicit permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Stacie|date=2016|title=Data Collection on School-aged Children through Common Core|url=|journal=I/S: A Journal of Law &amp; Policy for the Information Society|volume=12 |issue=305|pages=1–23|hdl=1811/80039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational Technology ("Edtech") ===

[[Educational technology]] ("edtech") is an emerging field in the area of education. According to Dylan Peterson, "edtech represents a broad category of educational products and services used in schools and by private individuals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Dylan|date=2016|title=EdTech and Student Privacy: California Law as a Model|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2130&amp;context=btlj|journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|volume=31|pages=961–995|doi=10.15779/Z38T840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy concerns surround the fact that large amounts of data of each student using edtech are collected and stored in a wide database that can be accessed by schools. This data may be personal to the students and they may not wish for others to view it. However, edtech companies claim that without storing as much student data as possible, it would be more difficult to create programs that effectively address the students' educational needs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Students with Disabilities ===
To help improve programs that benefit the educational experience of students with disabilities, some scholars propose a digitalized database of student records that are updated in real time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stahl|first=William|date=|title=Student Data Privacy, Digital Learning, and Special Education: Challenges at the Intersection of Policy and Practice.|url=|journal=Journal of Special Education Leadership|volume=29(2)|pages=79–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is so that educators can keep track of important information about students with various disabilities and monitor their academic performances for educational purposes. While these scholars support the idea of disclosure of data of students with disabilities, they make it very clear that strong legislation and policies must be enforced to protect the privacy of such data. It is currently a debate whether or not digitalized student data that can be accessed by many parties is really beneficial to support individuals with disabilities in school. Some are not comfortable with the idea that the data is updated frequently and disseminated widely, while others believe that the acquisition of such data is necessary to improve programs and enrich educational experiences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Privacy in Higher Education ==

=== Historical Perspective  ===
Since the 1970's, the commonly held perspective was that the right to privacy was an evaluation of individual worth. Further, [[technology]], even before the [[World Wide Web]], was perceived as having potentially negative effects such as allowing information to be breached.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grayson|first=Lawrence|date=1978|title=Education, Technology, and Individual Privacy|url=|journal=Educational Communication and Technology|volume=26(3)|pages=195-206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there were not many violations warranted that would urge legislation to act and shift their attention to protecting privacy in education or primarily individual privacy in general. Technology was also viewed as a source to uncover values, behaviors, motives and thoughts but at the same time, many thought that only qualified professionals had access to personal data. &lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; However, specifically in higher education, there was a perspective that individuals were susceptible to having their information breached. Thus, the role of education in the 1970's was viewed as one that safeguarded its students and staff to ensure privacy and prevent data from being breached given the technology that existed. 

=== College Dormitory Searches ===
In many public and private colleges and universities across the United States, enrolled students typically live on campus in college-operated [[Dormitory|dormitories]]. Since students live in these dormitories for the duration of about one year, many personalize and consider their dormitory rooms as their personal and personalized living space.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemons|first=B. R.|date=2012|title=Public Education and Student Privacy: Application of the Fourth Amendment to Dormitories at Public Colleges and Universities.|url=|journal=Brigham Young University Education &amp; Law Journal|volume=(1)|pages=31–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these dormitories are property owned by colleges and often students must waive their right to privacy for college representatives to conduct searches for safety purposes. While some believe that dormitory searches are effective for maintaining a safe community on campus, others believe that these searches are a violation of student privacy. Many cases have been filed by students in which they were caught with illegal substances in their dormitories during searches that these students felt were an invasion of their private living spaces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, only public or government-related searches with warrants are protected under the Fourth Amendment. Oftentimes college dormitory searches would be regarded as private searches and thus undergo lawsuits that claim a violation of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, in the case ''[[Morale v. Grigel]]'', a Resident Assistant at the New Hampshire Technical Institute searched a student's room on multiple occasions even though the student was not present in the room at all times. Once the Resident Assistant found marijuana in the room, the student was arrested for possessing illegal substances on college campus property. The student then filed a lawsuit against the Resident Assistant on the grounds that the searches were private and thus violated his Fourth Amendment right to protection from private searches. However, the court concluded that the Resident Assistant's employment status rendered him as a government agent and thus his searches were conducted on behalf of the college, a government-related institution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Social Networks ===
Within social networks, or particular websites that enable the sharing of information as well as communication among individuals, there exists a level of privacy that students prefer to keep their personal information or social life private from school personnel or faculty in order to avoid context collapse. 

==== '''Facebook''' ====
Technology enables the creation of one's own social presence through informal settings as well as formal settings that allow for the connection of student and instructors for academic purposes. &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennen Vanessa and Kerry Burner J.|first=|date=2017|title=Identity, context collapse, and Facebook use in higher education putting presence and privacy at odds|url=|journal=Distance Education|volume=38(2)|pages=173-192|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in higher education using Facebook typically censor or block their information from instructors. Thus, [[Facebook]] is primarily used to interact with friends and family rather than instructors. &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; By students blocking their information, they believe that they avoid context collapse that may cause confusion of who the person really is. Typically, students prefer to be present in the classroom and have their social life private from formal settings. &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Learning Analytics ===
With the improvement of technology, more data has become available within higher education. Administrators are then able to learn more about students in order to implement forms of improving student's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picciano|first=Anthony G.|date=2012|title=The Evolution of Big Data and Learning Analytics in American Higher Education|url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eric/docview/1238188091/AC784AD901ED497EPQ/10?accountid=14496|journal=Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks|volume=16|pages=9-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through learning analytics, which is defined as the focus on "students and their learning behaviors, gathering data from course management and student information systems in order to improve student success," administrators are able to obtain real-time empirical data such as insights and responses of student's learning processes. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ifenthaler, Dirk and Clara Schumacher|first=|date=2016|title=Student perceptions of privacy principles for learning analytics|url=|journal=Educational Technology Research &amp; Development|volume=64(5)|pages=923-938|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slade, Sharon and Paul Prinsloo|first=|date=2013|title=Learning Analytics: Ethical Issues and Dilemmas|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=57(10)|pages=1510-1529|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the privacy issues arise in how student data is collected, stored, analyzed and presented to [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; There arises ethical issues of "location and interpretation of data; informed consent, privacy, and de-identification of data; and classification and management of data." &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Students believe that data about them is elaborate and personalized and at the same time hold a conservative view about learning analytics. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Learning analytics]] helps obtain real time data for higher education learning processes but, at the same time may hinder the development of students such as critical thinking and autonomous learning. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  It is not as simple as saying that learning analytics will benefit students and thus increase their success and retention rates. &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is such because procedures to regulate access are put in place while at the same time bias and lack of validity and comprehension affect the ability to obtain data that will then be used for the benefit of students.

=== Data Breaches ===
As of 2017, there has been over 30 [[Data breach|data breaches]] since 2005. The susceptibility to breaches creates threats to institutional research (IR) professionals who store and manage student data within the regulatory structure that controls data management. &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beaudin|first=Katie|date=2017|title=The Legal Implications of Storing Student Data: Preparing for and Responding to Data Breaches|url=|journal=New Directions for Institutional Research|volume=|pages=37-48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further than this, student information is then brought to light which can threaten them as well. As vast amounts of data continues to be actively collected, potential breaching through hacking, physical theft, and by vendors becomes more probable. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Preventative Measures''' &lt;p&gt;Those who study the implications of data breaches emphasize that data should be kept to a minimum and that steps should be taken in order to see who can be trusted to regulate this information in order to keep data private and not accessible to all employees. &lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beaudin|first=Katie|date=2017|title=The Legal Implications of Storing Student Data: Preparing for and Responding to Data Breaches|url=|journal=New Directions for Institutional Research|volume=|pages=37-48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also talk about investing in educating employees about what can and cannot be done with data. Further, they state that institutions should use the resources available at their own college/university in order to most effectively implement policies and procedures to keep data private. Exercising caution against [[third-party vendors]] that help with data is advised and further that there should be a contract established that 1) defines who exactly who will be working with data, 2) makes clear that data is sensitive and thus should be handled with care, 3) and includes security procedures that  describe the exact responsibility of the vendor just in case data is breached. &lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writers who investigate data breaches in higher education advise that research professionals should understand that data breaches are bound to happen and that it is better to implement policies and take preventative measures in the first place to ensure the security of data. &lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Educational Records in Higher Education ===
'''Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)'''

The [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act|Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974]] limits the “disclosure of certain information contained in a student’s education record to third parties” which includes parents if the student has not given consent. &lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tribbensee|first=Nancy|date=2008|title=Privacy and Confidentiality: Balancing Student Rights and Campus Safety|url=|journal=Journal of College and University Law|volume=34(2)|pages=393-418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third parties can be parents, family, another institution (mental health providers), or pursuants of a subpoena or court order (law enforcement). It gives colleges and universities the right to "inspect and review" educational records that can disclosed if 1) consent is given by the student, 2) if the information falls within the definition of "directory information" (information that is not considered harmful such as name, major and address), 3) if the information is of "legitimate educational interest" (if an official needs to review the education records in order to fulfill their responsibilities within the University), 4) the student is tax dependent, 5) if it regards drugs or alcohol violations, 6) if it involves serious conduct violations, and 7) when it involves health or safety emergencies &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

For example, if a student in a residence hall is diagnosed with a contagious disease (measles), has a serious eating disorder, has suicidal ideation, binge drinks heavily, or has erratic and angry behaviors. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Furthermore, information can be released if it entails disciplinary information such as a student who is an “alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense." &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; However, there have been cases where troubled students remain in college, without the college or university advising parents about their "strange" behavior, which resulted in students to take their own lives. The cases of [[Jain v. Iowa|J&lt;i&gt;ain v. Iowa&lt;/i&gt;]]'', [[Shin v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'' and &lt;i&gt;[[Mahoney v. Allegheny College]]&lt;/i&gt; exemplify this issue. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Nonetheless, according to FERPA, disclosures are considered to be made in “good faith based upon the available facts.”&lt;p&gt;Educational records are covered by FERPA. They are not just academic records, class schedules or transcripts but also financial records, disciplinary records, "disability accommodation records, photographs, e-mails, and electronic database records." &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Official documentation is needed to fall under FERPA even if this entails a personal experience or observation.&lt;/p&gt;What is not covered under FERPA are: law enforcement records, treatment records, and sole possession records and instead fall under other laws or considerations. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

'''In Loco Parentis''' 

Due to the influence of FERPA, there has been a shift from ''in loco parentis'', to &lt;i&gt;in sin parentibus&lt;/i&gt;, and back to &lt;i&gt;i[[In loco parentis|n loco parentis]]&lt;/i&gt;. ''In sine parentibus'' means "without parents" meanwhile in loco parentis means "in place of the parent." &lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Britton|date=2007|title=Students Rights: From In Loco Parentis to Sine Parentibus and Back Again? Understanding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act in Higher Education"|url=|journal=Brigham Young University Education &amp; Law Journal|volume=2(6)|pages=321-350|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as represented by FERPA, the shift to &lt;i&gt;in loco parentis&lt;/i&gt; within higher education is the act of the school taking over the legal responsibility of parents. &lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This means that college authorities stand in place of parents.

The role of FERPA is to enhance student achievement through greater parent involvement as well as protecting the private interests of students. Yet, the shift toward &lt;i&gt;in loco parentis&lt;/i&gt; also comes with concerns related to educational records. More specifically, there is a concern about the extent to which large and powerful institutions obtain information to their advantage such as data that is gathered by researchers and policymakers. &lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newton, Kenneth B. and Diana C. Pullin|first=|date=1996|title=Balancing Privacy and Confidentiality Rights with Duties and Disclosure and Dissemination of Federal Education Statistics|url=|journal=Journal of Law &amp; Education|volume=25(1)|pages=1-54|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand there are concerns that relate to the university itself disclosing information. For example, under FERPA, the school can disclose information about students to parents if it includes alcohol and drug related incidents any time if they are under 21. &lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Because of reasons like these, there is a concern that there may be "systematic disclosure policies" that become out of control and thus harm student rights and privacy. &lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

'''Privacy vs. Confidentiality'''

Within student records there is a difference between what is privacy and what is confidentiality. Privacy is more of a legal concept and is defined as the "right of a person to withhold himself and his property from public scrutiny if he so chooses." &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caruso|first=Lawrence|date=1971|title=Privacy of Student and Confidentiality of Student Records|url=|journal=Case Western Law Review|volume=22(3)|pages=379-389|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus privacy gives the individual the right to be let alone which means that the university itself does not have the right to pry into student's personal affairs or reveal student information unless there are explicit and valid reasons in doing so or permission has been granted by the student. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Yet even giving permission does not mean that the student has given permission to have all of their information revealed from then on but rather than permission is granted within the particular circumstance.

On the other hand, confidentiality means that files and records of students are not authorized to be disclosed to third parties such as not disclosing information that is received in confidence from a patient and physician. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Given this, authors who focus on confidentiality ask questions such as:&lt;p&gt;1) Does the communication originate in confidence?&lt;/p&gt;2) Is the element of confidentiality essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relationship between the parties?&lt;p&gt;3) Is the relationship one that must be fostered??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Will there result an injury that is greater than any benefits which may be gained from that disclosure?&lt;/p&gt;If the answers are "yes" then the university may be legally bound to not disclose information unless it overrides the interest. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Medical Records ===
The terms privacy and confidentiality arise when it comes to medical records. 

'''Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996'''

The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] provides privacy to data that is related to medical or mental health records that are legally more restrictive than FERPA in regards to confidentiality. HIPAA includes provisions that “intend to facilitate the creation of a national system for the electronic transmission and exchange of medical record information” such as access to information that is individually identifiable like health plans and health care. &lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodward, Beverly and Dale Hammerschmidt|first=|date=2003|title=Requiring Consent Vs. Waiving Consent for Medical Records Research: A Minnesota Law Vs. the U.S. (HIPAA) Privacy Rule|url=|journal=Health Care Analysis|volume=11(3)|pages=207-218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act “defined protected health information so as to exclude individually identifiable health information that is included in education records covered by FERPA and that is in treatment records that are exempted from FERPA.” &lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tribbensee|first=Nancy|date=2008|title=Privacy and Confidentiality: Balancing Student Rights and Campus Safety|url=|journal=Journal of College and University Law|volume=34(2)|pages=393-418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between educational records and treatment records is that treatment records fall under federal and state law while educational records fall under FERPA. Nevertheless, the documentation of patient and caregiver is confidential meaning that medical records will not be disclosed unless consent is given or there is a belief that disclosing records is crucial. &lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; Furthermore, generally, health care providers do not disclose information unless they meet a standard that falls above the required FERPA health or safety exception, or consent is given, and thus is limited in providing information within the constraints of the confidentiality among patient and provider. &lt;ref name=":142" /&gt;

'''Integration of Mental and Physical Records''' 

In some instances, college campuses have begun to integrate physical and mental health needs of patients. This means that medical records are becoming more shared among physicians as well as counselors or psychologists that work with students. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davenport|first=Robin G.|date=2017|title=The Integration of Health and Counseling Services on College Campuses: Is There a Risk in Maintaining Student Patients' Privacy?|url=|journal=Journal of College Student Psychotherapy|volume=31(4)|pages=268-280|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, medical providers, separately, have the obligation to withhold confidential information as an ethical duty and state privacy regulations. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; For example, health providers such as counselors, also have the obligation to be confidential and not disclose private information. However, as medical providers move towards integrated care, such that mental and physical records are shared amongst themselves, there arises a confidentiality challenge that may lead to college students to fall behind in school. Since confidentiality is compromised as information is disclosed among providers that use this method of continuity care, less students utilize therapy because they refuse to disclose private information that can then be shared with others. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This simultaneously fuels the stigma towards college counseling. Thus, as more information becomes disclosed, less college students seek counseling due to lack of confidentiality as medical records of patients are disclosed between medical providers, when legally the obligation of these medical providers is to abide and guarantee privacy and confidentiality by withholding patient's information unless under specific circumstances.

Further, outside of sharing information among medical providers, there is also the issue of sharing information with [[Research|researchers]]. They claim that medical records are difficult to access but when they are, it opens up the door for research. &lt;ref name=":123"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodward, Beverly and Dale Hammerschmidt|first=|date=2003|title=Requiring Consent Vs. Waiving Consent for Medical Records Research: A Minnesota Law Vs. the U.S. (HIPAA) Privacy Rule|url=|journal=Health Care Analysis|volume=11(3)|pages=207-218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, at the same time it opens the door to privacy and confidentiality risks.

'''Electronic Health Records''' &lt;p&gt;Since technology continues to revolutionize, [[Medical record|medical records]] have become accessible as electronic health records. This allows information to be shared more easily but appears to create a challenge for stigma management and disclosing information during medical appointments.&lt;/p&gt;An in-depth interview study called "Negotiating stigma in health care: disclosure and the role of electronic health records" was made that took into account sexual minority men (gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men) in the U.S. to seek how they viewed electronic health records. &lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stablein, Timothy; Joseph Lorenzo Hall; Chauna Pervis and Denise L. Anthony|first=|date=2015|title=Negotiating stigma in health care: disclosure and the role of electronic health records|url=|journal=Health Sociology Review|volume=24(3)|pages=227-241|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What the study found is that there were concerns of privacy in terms of how the electronic aspect creates a barrier to be open and talk about seemingly confidential information as well as how it may challenge the right to confidentiality and privacy. On the other hand, the study also found that electronic health records may benefit by improving communication among providers when sharing information and further, to provide better care especially after the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical and Health Act]] invested billions in the adoption of electronic health records to improve the quality of care. &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The study concludes that technology may enhance medical care yet at the same time fuel the stigma that seeking medical help is bad and thus would hinder patients to make appointments, to attend counseling with certain providers, or disclose personal information such as [[sexual identity]] and [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV status]] that they believe will be shared to others without their consent. &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

'''State Laws''' 

Federal regulations allow states to place their own regulations, to either increase or decrease the requirements for disclosure, but states who do are few. &lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegler|first=Gregory|date=1996|title=What Should Be the Scope of Privacy Protections for Student Health Records? A Look at Massachusetts and Federal Law|url=|journal=Journal of Law Education|volume=25(2)|pages=237-270|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Minnesota State Law

In 1996 the state of [[Minnesota]] placed a law regarding medical records that appeared to be more stringent than HIPAA. Minnesota law attempted to obtain a "written general authorization for such release from the patient" as a form to impede the activities of researchers or providers to share information without given consent. &lt;ref name=":124"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodward, Beverly and Dale Hammerschmidt|first=|date=2003|title=Requiring Consent Vs. Waiving Consent for Medical Records Research: A Minnesota Law Vs. the U.S. (HIPAA) Privacy Rule|url=|journal=Health Care Analysis|volume=11(3)|pages=207-218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitals in Minnesota even made brochures that highlight patient's rights to confidentiality and that they can give consent in writing if they allow for their medical records to be released outside of the facility. Thus, the law required health care providers to obtain a written consent and authorization from patients in order for medical records to be released and used for research. &lt;ref name=":124" /&gt; However, researchers themselves campaigned against the law and the law was not successful in enforcing the right that patients have to refuse their information to be released. Meanwhile, the patients themselves wanted information as to what information is being used within their medical records.

As of 2006, under Minnesota's state rights, individuals have the right to: see and get a copy of their medical records, have information added to their medical records in order to make them accurate, file a complaint, and importantly, sue in state court for violations of their rights under state law. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pritts, Joy, Nina L. Kudszuz, Health Policy Institute and Georgetown University|first=|date=2006|title=Your Medical Record Rights in Minnesota: A Guide to Consumer Rights under HIPAA|url=|journal=The National Library of Medicine|volume=|pages=1-30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Massachusetts State Law 

The [[Massachusetts]] state law imposed the requirement that a person has the right against the unreasonable interference of privacy and states that the superior court shall have jurisdiction to enforce a person's right and thus must award damages if need be. &lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegler|first=Gregory|date=1996|title=What Should Be the Scope of Privacy Protections for Student Health Records? A Look at Massachusetts and Federal Law|url=|journal=Journal of Law Education|volume=25(2)|pages=237-270|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the law there are strict privacy protections classified as medical. Records are considered educational records unless there exists there need be heightened confidentiality such as child abuse, AIDS, substance abuse, immigration status, pregnancy and abortion. &lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; Further, it is considered a medical record if a school-based clinic is under “operation of an outside entity or by a physician under any employment arrangement” and considered educational records if not considered for heightened confidentiality. &lt;ref name=":152" /&gt;

If an individual believes that their right to privacy they have the right to file a complaint with the Officer for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Health and Human services against health care providers, with the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine against doctors and with the Department of Public Health against hospitals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pritts, Joy; Health Policy Institute; Georgetown University|first=|date=2005|title=Your Medical Record Rights in Massachusetts: A Guide to Consumer Rights under HIPAA|url=|journal=Georgetown University|volume=|pages=1-29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* California State Law

The [[Confidentiality of Medical Information Act]] (CMIA) is a California state law that includes more information than HIPAA in regards to medical records. &lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/cfceducation-foundationyour-medical-privacy-rights/confidentiality-of-medical-information-act/|title=The Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA)|last=|first=|date=2011-2012|website=Education Foundation: Consumer Federation of California|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main function is to protect confidentiality of identifiable medical information obtained by an individual's health care provider. It applies to licenses providers such as physicians and nurses. It prohibit medical providers to disclose medical information without obtaining authorization first and that any medical information about an individual is preserved in confidentiality by anyone who comes in contact with it. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;An individual whose confidentiality is not respected may obtain $1,000 and the amount of actual damages and for the person or entity that discloses confidential information is liable for an administrative fine. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Student and Professional Archetypes ===
'''Students With Disabilities''' 

Tension on campus arises because as of the event of 9/11 some people on campus are fearful or overreact in demanding to know which students have conduct records or a disability accommodation. &lt;ref name=":143"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tribbensee|first=Nancy|date=2008|title=Privacy and Confidentiality: Balancing Student Rights and Campus Safety|url=|journal=Journal of College and University Law|volume=34(2)|pages=393-418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tension of whether the information will be used to discriminate or treat students unfairly. Nevertheless, the distribution of this information is not limited by FERPA among school officials as long as the disclosure is done due to "legitimate educational interests." &lt;ref name=":143" /&gt;

'''Foreign Students''' 

The event of 9/11 impacted the release of information of students with visas and leads to the questioning of the responsibility and obligation of universities to report foreign student's information. Foreign individuals granted the opportunity to study in the U.S. for a period of time are given one of three visas: [[F visa|F-1]] for academic studying, [[J-1 visa|J-1]] for exchange visitors, and [[M-1 visa|M-1]] for vocational training. &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khatcheressian|first=Laura|date=2003|title=FERPA and the Immigration and Naturalization Service: A Guide for University Counsel on Federal Rules for Collecting, Maintaining and Releasing Information About Foreign Students|url=|journal=Journal of College and University|volume=29(2)|pages=457-484|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the government claims that there are no accurate records of the 547,000 individuals holding student status (as of 2003). &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Meanwhile, universities are supposed to report information the information of F-1 and M-1 students to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)]] such as their name, date and place of birth, current address, student status, degree program, field of study, etc. &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; For those with J-1 visas, the sponsoring organization is to report information such as the individuals activities and compliance. Yet, if they do not necessarily report the information they are at least required to keep track of their foreign student's information.

Importantly, regulations are not addressed in regards to how FERPA applies. The school may release information if the student is no longer enrolled if it needs to comply with judicial order, if it lawfully issues a subpoena, or if there are "specific and articulable facts” that show that a student’s education record may contain information relevant to investigation or prosecution.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Information can also be disclosed if it includes the protection of health or safety of students, especially if it is to “protect the health and safety of Americans.” Further, students who were issued [[I-20A forms|I-20A]] or [[I-20M forms|I-20M]] forms (F-1 and M-1 students) or [[J-1 visa|DS-2019]] forms (J-1 students) automatically grant consent to any information needed to determine immigrant’s status or release information that's related to the individual’s compliance with the Exchange Visitor Program. &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Yet, this information is stated to be only given to certain organizations such as the INS or the [[United States Department of State|Department of State.]] &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

'''Librarians''' 

* Privacy Assessment 

Librarians themselves take part in protecting the right of library users privacy. Typically, the library itself aims to protect user's information primarily regarding what they do when they use technology, such as using computers to surf the web. According to [[Michael Zimmer (academic)|Michael Zimmer]] in 2014, 95 percent of librarians agree or strongly agree individuals should control their personal information and many agree that there are threats to the privacy of their users. &lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmer|first=Michael|date=2014|title=Librarians' Attitudes Regarding Information and Internet Privacy|url=|journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy|volume=84(2)|pages=123-151|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted by the Office for Intellectual Freedom which obtained over 1,000 responses of librarians and library professionals found is that the [[Library Bill of Rights]] is honored which believe that everyone is entitled to "freedom of access, freedom to read texts and view images, and freedom of thought and expression" &lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; The [[Librarian's Code of Ethics]] and the adoption of the [[Privacy Act of 1974]] also illuminate not just on a librarian level but also on a federal level that privacy is to be protected. &lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voeller|first=Stacy|date=2007|title=Privacy Policy Assessment for the Livingston Lord Library At Minnesota State University Moorhead|url=|journal=Library Philosophy and Practice|volume=|pages=1-29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other non-governmental acts that protect the right to privacy and thus limit the information that can be collected are:

[[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]]

[[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]]

[[Credit Reporting Act]]

Further, the [[Library 2.0]] tools and services enhance what the user can do but at the same time track, collect and retain data that then may affect individuals especially since the recent dominance of social media. Yet, because of librarian's belief of protecting the rights of users, they take their own initiative in protecting user's information by destroying access logs daily, posting warning signs, and teaching users about privacy issues. &lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; This is especially done in order for information to not be obtained outside of legal restrictions.

Specifically, the Livingston Lord Library (LLL) of Minnesota State University's mission is to support both cultural and academic experiences and to encourage lifelong learning. Thus, their particular library provides resources that allows individuals to enhance their knowledge and skills. At the same time, they work to maintain their image of believing in confidentiality such that people can exercise their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right. &lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Yet, there is not specific documentation as of 2007 that displays what privacy is to them. &lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Nevertheless, there are examples of librarians exerting effort to ensure confidentiality and privacy by protecting their user's information.

=== Role of Campus Privacy Officers ===
[[Campus privacy officer|Campus Privacy Officers]] (CPO's) are individuals within the institution who have the institutional responsibility for anything that regards privacy, they make sure that privacy is upheld within higher education. &lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bermann, Sol, Susan Blair, Sara Chambers, Michael Corn, Denise Dolezal, Patrick Feehan, Jeff Gassaway, Lisa Ho, Gary Miller, Sarah Morrow, Geoffrey Nathan,  Leonard Nelson, Jane Rosenthal, Scott Schafer, and Kent Wada|first=|date=2016|title=The Higher Educational CPO Primer, Part 1 Welcome Kit for Chief Privacy Officers in Higher Education|url=|journal=Higher Education Information Security Council|volume=|pages=1-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet they are relatively new in the United States but nevertheless have been growing since 2002. Their role or function in higher education is:

“sustaining an environment where faculty and student are free to inquire, experiment, discover, speak, and participate in discourse is without intimidation, protecting against and responding to modern-day cybersecurity threats, protecting the interests of individuals and assuring they have appropriate influence over data about themselves, pursuing opportunities for use of data in medical treatment, research, and student success, and enabling shared governance” &lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Their activities include maintaining: data privacy policies, notices, personal data inventory, governance structure and to respond to both complaints and requests from individuals, among other tasks. &lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

A few of the major issues that CPO's focus on are :

* Education records and FERPA
* HIPAA
* "Big data, algorithms, analytics, and usage"
* "Contractual agreements"
* "Information security monitoring and the privacy impact of surveillance" &lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Controversies ===
'''University of California Berkeley''' 

In 1964 students at UC Berkeley protested against the ban that prevented them from engaging in political activity on campus. FBI Director J.Edgar Hoover got involved because he thought that the Free Speech Movement had to do with Communism that aimed to disrupt Capitalism and thus U.S. government. &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/21/159373688/student-subversives-and-the-fbis-dirty-tricks|title=Student 'Subversives' and the FBI's 'Dirty Tricks'|last=Fresh Air|first=|date=2012|website=NPR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, Seth Rosenfield's book "Subersives: The FBI's War on Student Radicals, and Reagan's Rise to Power" demonstrates how Hoover investigated the movement and specifically student activists such as Mario Savio through "'intense surveillance and harassment.'" &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Further, when Clark Kerr, former president of Berkeley and then vice chancellor of the University of California system, lifted the ban on political engagement and further against "Communist speakers" the FBI targeted him and tried to get him fired. Hoover had ordered agents to find information about Kerr and leak it to the Board of Regents in order to show that Kerr was not fulfilling his role as president and thus had to be fired. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Essentially, what it points to is that in the 1960's the FBI took on the role of trying to eliminate Communism within the UC Berkeley campus by investigating particular individuals in order to see if they were really Communist or in the case of Kerr to fire them for lifting the ban on political engagement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/fbi-records-free-speech-movement-must-be-disclosed|title=FBI records on Free Speech Movement must be disclosed|last=Freedom of Information|first=|date=1995|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that this is a breach in privacy because the FBI surveilled and investigated individuals without their consent. Others say that it was needed in order to make sure that no Communist activity was taking place particularly on the Berkeley campus due to the Free Speech Movement.  

'''Princeton University'''

In 2002 [[Princeton University|Princeton University’s]] admission staff accessed a Yale University website used to inform applicants that they have been admitted. &lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=Margaret|date=2003|title=FERPA: Only a Piece of the Privacy Puzzle|url=|journal=Journal of College and University Law|volume=29(3)|pages=679-718|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of Yale University accessing private information was brought to light. As a result, Yale University responded that it would improve their website with additional security to prevent another breach. Meanwhile, Princeton University responded by announcing the resignation of the top Princeton  admissions official. &lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Some say that acts like these raise the issues of student record privacy in the digital world. 

'''University of Oregon''' 

In 2015 a woman who said she was raped by three basketball players sued the University of Oregon for disclosing her mental health records to an attorney. &lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/09/391876192/college-rape-case-shows-a-key-limit-to-medical-privacy-law|title=Shots: Health News From NPR|last=Foden-Vencil|first=Kristian|date=2015|work=College Rape Case Shows A Key Limit to Medical Privacy Law|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case gave rise to employees from the counseling center to write an open letter to the university community as a form to show that they were disturbed by the university's actions. Yet, officials argue that because the women claimed to have emotional distress then the university had the right to her medical records under FERPA. &lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; An attorney named Steve McDonald argued that HIPAA did not apply in this case. Meanwhile, Lynn Daggett, a FERPA specialist, stated that the university has the right to get access to student medical records, especially if entails the need for legal defense. This led to Denise Horn, a U.S. Department of Education representative of the time, to write a statement addressing that higher education institutions should comply with FERPA but also respect the expectation of confidentiality between patient and counselor/therapist. &lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

'''Public sphere pedagogy''' ('''PSP''') represents an approach to educational engagement that connects classroom activities with real world civic engagement.&lt;ref name="jill12"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0024-1822| volume = 97| issue = 2| pages = 40–45| last = Swiencicki| first = Jill|author2=Chris Fosen |author3=Sofie Burton |author4=Justin Gonder |author5=Thia Wolf | title = The Town Hall Meeting: Imagining a Self through Public-Sphere Pedagogy| journal = Liberal Education| accessdate = 2014-03-15| year = 2011| url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=64443756&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of PSP programs is to connect class assignments, content, and readings with contemporary public issues.&lt;ref name="ChicoPSP"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About Public Sphere Pedagogy - First-Year Experience | work = California State University Chico | accessdate = 2014-03-15 | year = 2013 | url = http://www.csuchico.edu/fye/Public_Sphere_Work/index.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are then asked to participate with members of the community in various forms of [[public sphere]] discourse and [[democracy|democratic]] participation such as [[town hall meetings]] and public debate events.&lt;ref name="enjoymag"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Mosby| first = Claudia| title = The Great Debate and Civic Expo| work = Enjoy Magazine: Northern California Living| accessdate = 2014-03-15| date = 2013-10-30| url = http://www.enjoymagazine.net/2013/10/30/the-great-debate-and-civic-expo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these events, students are challenged to practice [[civic engagement]] and [[civil discourse]].

__TOC__

==Theoretical foundations==

===Public sphere theory===
Public sphere pedagogy is theoretically grounded in [[Jürgen Habermas]]' conceptualization of the public sphere.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  In his seminal work ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'', Habermas envisioned the public sphere as an inclusive discursive space in which the citizens of a society gathered, discussed, and debated over the issues of the day.&lt;ref name="STPS"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The MIT Press | isbn = 0262581086 | last = Habermas | first = J. | others = Thomas Burger, Frederick Lawewnce (trans.) | title = The structural transformation of the public sphere: An inquiry into a category of bourgeois society | location = Cambridge, MA | year = 1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argued that the European bourgeois public sphere that emerged in eighteenth century coffee houses and salons represented an idealized form of the public sphere. Individuals engaging in discussion in these spaces would share and debate their views with one another. Habermas argues that this dialectic encounter was a critical part of one's social life where individuals, as part of a larger public, could construct [[public opinion]] through critical [[rational discourse]]. Habermas argued that these discussions served to fill the gap between the state and the people by creating what he called a "[[civil society]]". Further, Habermas argued that a functioning public sphere was critical to maintaining a healthy democratic order and [[deliberative democracy]].&lt;ref name="calhoun92"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The MIT Press | isbn = 0262531143 | others = Craig Calhoun (ed.) | title = Habermas and the public sphere | location = Cambridge, MA | year = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional notion of a face-to-face public sphere has evolved with the invention of online technologies. The public sphere no longer requires a physical setting, but can manifest in [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Habermas’ heritage: The future of the public sphere in the network society | last = Boeder | first = Pieter| journal = First Monday| accessdate = 2014-03-17| url = http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1280/1200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee house discussions idealized by Habermas have expanded to blogs, discussion forums, and online videos. [[Henry Giroux]] in particular discusses the role of new media in the public sphere and public pedagogy.&lt;ref name="Biesta"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14649365.2012.723736| issn = 1464-9365| volume = 13| issue = 7| pages = 683–697| last = Biesta| first = Gert| title = Becoming public: public pedagogy, citizenship and the public sphere| journal = Social &amp; Cultural Geography| accessdate = 2014-03-19| date = 2012| url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14649365.2012.723736}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars debate whether [[computer-mediated communication]] in an online setting actually constitutes a functioning public sphere or just a public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/14614440222226244| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 9–27| last = Papacharissi| first = Zizi| title = The virtual sphere: The internet as a public sphere| journal = New Media &amp; Society| year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/1461444810379862| volume = 13| issue = 5| pages = 739–754| last = Goldberg| first = Greg| title = Rethinking the public/virtual sphere: The problem with participation| journal = New Media &amp; Society| year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===The Town Hall Meeting===
Town Hall Meetings are one way public sphere pedagogy has been integrated into curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The CSU, Chico Town Hall Meeting - First-Year Experience - CSU, Chico | work = California State University Chico | accessdate = 2014-03-15 | year = 2014 | url = http://www.csuchico.edu/fye/thm/index.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event began at [[California State University, Chico]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | conference = 2012 American Democracy Project and The Democracy Commitment National Meeting | last = Weber | first = Lori M. | title = Public Sphere Pedagogy: The Town Hall Meeting and the Chico Great Debate Programs, Assessing the Effect on Students' Civic Dispositions and Success | location = San Antonio, Texas | date = 2012-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes participating in the Town Hall event require students to research and write about controversial issues. Students then come together with classmates, students from other classes, faculty, and community members. During the Town Hall Meeting, participants move into breakout sessions to share their work and engage in discussions about their topics. Faculty and community members moderate these discussions, share expert insight, and move students toward further development of their work.

===The Great Debate===
The Great Debate also uses public sphere pedagogy as its foundation. This event started at California State University, Chico in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Chico Great Debate - First-Year Experience - CSU, Chico | format = California State University Chico | accessdate = 2014-03-15 | year = 2014 | url = http://www.csuchico.edu/fye/greatdebate/index.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been implemented at [[Butte College]], [[Shasta College]],&lt;ref name="enjoymag" /&gt; and [[Chabot College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Chang| first = Nick| title = Hayward’s ‘Great Debate’ Brings Bilingual Education to Forefront| work = The Pioneer: California State University East Bay| accessdate = 2014-03-15| date = 2013-12-12| url = http://thepioneeronline.com/19649/news/haywards-great-debate-brings-bilingual-education-to-forefront/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Debate requires students from a variety of classes to research and write about a controversial theme.

Students give individual and group presentations, engage in formal debates, break out into discussion sessions, and display interactive poster presentations. Community members and public officials also participate as moderators, discussion leaders, and debaters. Unlike the Town Hall Meetings, which usually take place on campus property, the Great Debate is hosted in public spaces including City Council Chambers and public libraries.

===The Student Voices program===

Student Voices programs are a type of civic engagement initiative that have been implemented in several high schools in the United States. The curriculum has high school students research and complete classroom assignments on current issues in government and candidates in local elections.&lt;ref name="APPC"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Jamieson | first = Kathleen Hall | title = Student Voices | work = The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | date = 2008-05-07 | url = http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/political-communication/student-voices/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students then connect with outside communities via the digital public sphere and engage in moderated "Speak Out" events. Student Voices programs have been successfully implemented in curricula in Seattle&lt;ref name="ccca"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Center for Communication &amp; Civic Engagement :: Projects : Student Voices (2001-2006) | work = Center for Communication and Civic Engagement | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | date = 2005-05-17 | url = http://ccce.com.washington.edu/projects/studentVoices.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pennsylvania&lt;ref name="feldman07"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/520686 | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–100 | last = Feldman | first = Lauren |author2=Josh Pasek |author3=Daniel Romer |author4=Kathleen Hall Jamieson  | title = Identifying Best Practices in Civic Education: Lessons from the Student Voices Program | journal = American Journal of Education | date = 2007-11-01 | jstor = 10.1086/520692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; school districts.

==Critiques==
Public sphere pedagogy inherently is subject to many of the criticisms of Habermas' conception of the public sphere.  Chief among them is the traditionally exclusionary nature. The bourgeois public sphere, as introduced by Habermas, has been characterized as highly patriarchal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/466240 | issn = 0164-2472 | issue = 25/26 | pages = 56–80 | last = Fraser | first = Nancy | title = Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy | journal = Social Text | date = 1990 | jstor = 466240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and oblivious to the existence of female&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The MIT Press | isbn = 0262531143 | pages = 259–288 | editors = Craig Calhoun (ed.) | last = Ryan | first = M. P. | title = Habermas and the public sphere | chapter = Gender and public access: Women's politics in nineteenth century America | location = Cambridge, MA | date = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and plebeian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| isbn = 0816620318| last = Negt| first = Oskar|author2=Alexander Kluge | others = Peter Labanyi, Jamie Owen Daniel, Assebja Oksiloff (trans.)| title = Public sphere and experience: Toward an analysis of the bourgeois and proletarian public sphere| location = Minneapolis, MN| date = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; styles of discourse. The concern here is that as a model of the bourgeois public sphere, applications of public sphere pedagogy might alienate students and community members unaccustomed to this type of dialectic experience.
In addition to its exclusionary nature, attention has also been called  to Habermas' privileging of a hegemonic public sphere. [[Michael Warner]] argues  that the bourgeois public sphere was structured to be affable to those privileged few who made up the powerful upperclass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Zone Books | isbn = 1890951285 | last = Warner | first = Michael | title = Publics and counterpublics | location = New York, NY | date = 2002-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While students participating in public sphere pedagogy application receive special training in their classrooms, the same is not necessarily true of community members who participate. This specialized student training draws two critiques. First, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of instruction risks erasing the plurality that is central to being a public.&lt;ref name="Biesta"/&gt; Training individuals how to be "good" citizens prescribes action in a way that limits the scope of politics and the public sphere. Second, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of learning risks eclipsing politics with education.&lt;ref name="Biesta"/&gt; Turning political and social issues into learning problems individualizes the issues instead of making them the responsibility of the public.

'''Sequence organizers''' are a type of [[graphic organizer]] that help students to see the sequential relationship between events in a text. They can show a process or portray an event sequence in a simplified manner. They can help students identify cause-and-effect relationships. A [[graphic organizer]] can be also known as a [[knowledge map]], a [[concept map]], a [[story map]], a [[cognitive organizer]], an [[advance organizer]], or a [[concept diagram]]. They are used as a communication tool to employ visual symbols to express knowledge, concepts, thoughts or ideas, and the relationships between them.

== Types ==

* [[Topic map|Topic or knowledge maps]] visually depict where items of information exist.
* Concept maps illustrate relationships between two or more concepts.
* Story maps identify the elements of a story and the main storyline.
* Webs show how information categories relate to one another.
* [[Mind map]]s visually represent central ideas surrounded by connected topics and subtopics.

== Teaching ==

When students read a text that outlines a story, process or series of events, it can be useful to put the information in a sequence. Breaking down information into sections can make it easier to understand as a whole. Moreover, large pictures help emphasize the core meaning along with practical demonstrations. A graphic organizer can be used as a teaching tool in two ways:

* From graphic organizer to text – A completed sequence organizer is used to create a piece of writing based on the information it contains.
* From text to graphic organizer – A sequence organizer is used to simplify, in note form, events in a sequential order. This is often used by teachers to check student's comprehension of a text.

=== More ideas ===

Students who need more help can be provided with key events already written in the left hand arrows.

If students are reading different sections of the same text, such as a jigsaw activity, they should complete a particular portion of their organizer. When the classmates assemble, they can exchange their portions to make notes of important information of other sections.

Organizers can be used as a platform to prepare a rough draft for a narrative text, or a summarize review of sequential information from more than one textual source or learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationoasis.com/curriculum/GO/sequence.htm |title=Graphic Organizers Sequence |publisher=Educationoasis.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edhelperclipart.com/clipart/teachers/org-howtouse.pdf |format=PDF |title=How To Use Graphic Organizers |publisher=Edhelperclipart.com |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''settlement movement''' was a [[reformist]] social movement that began in the 1880s and peaked around the 1920s in England and the U.S. Its goal was to bring the rich and the poor of society together in both physical proximity and social interconnectedness. Its main object was the establishment of "settlement houses" in poor urban areas, in which volunteer middle-class "settlement workers" would live, hoping to share knowledge and culture with, and [[poverty reduction|alleviate the poverty]] of, their low-income neighbors. The "settlement houses" provided services such as daycare, education, and healthcare to improve the lives of the poor in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
===England===
The movement started in London in 1884 with the founding of [[Toynbee Hall]]. These houses, radically different from those in America, often offered food, shelter, and basic and [[higher education]], provided by virtue of charity on part of wealthy donors, the residents of the city, and (for education) scholars who volunteered their time.

[[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, increasingly concerned with poverty, gave rise to the movement whereby those connected to universities settled students in slum areas to live and work alongside local people. Through their efforts settlement houses were established for education, savings, sports, and arts. Such institutions were often praised by religious representatives concerned with the lives of the poor, and criticised as normative or moralistic by radical social movements.

There were basic commonalities in the movement.  These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialisation, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.

[[File:Toynbee Hall 1902.jpg|thumb|Toynbee Hall settlement house, founded 1884, pictured here in 1902]]
The [[British Association of Settlements and Social Action Centres]] is a network of such organisations. During the [[Social Gospel|social Christian movement]], [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel]] and [[Henrietta Barnett]] founded Toynbee Hall, [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]]&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357" /&gt; in 1884 in Bethnal Green. Other early examples include [[Browning Hall]], formed in [[Walworth]] in 1895 by [[Francis Herbert Stead]], and Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London (see [[Percy Alden]]). There is also a global network, the [[International Federation of Settlements]].

The movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, "have been a foundation for social work practice in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, J. M. (2008). Common space, safe place: Lived experiences of former settlement house participants from the West Town and Humboldt Park neighborhoods of Chicago''  Dissertation Abstract International'', ''69''(5), 1682A. (UMI No. AAI3314871) Retrieved July 13, 2009, from Dissertations and Theses Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

As higher education opened up to women, young female graduates brought their energy to the settlement movement. The Women's University Settlement (now Blackfriars Settlement) was founded in 1887 "by women from [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] and [[Newnham College]]s at [[Cambridge University]], [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret]] and [[Somerville College]]s at [[Oxford University]] and [[Bedford College, London|Bedford]] and [[Royal Holloway]] Universities"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk/history |website=www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===United States===
[[File:Bohemmian Youth East St. Louis.jpg|thumb|Bohemian immigrant youth at the [[Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House]] in 1918 in East St. Louis, Illinois]]
Between 1890 and 1910, more than 12 million European people immigrated to the United States. They came from Ireland, Russia, Italy and other European countries and provided cheap factory labor, a demand that was created with the country's [[Manifest destiny|expansion into the west]] following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many immigrants lived in crowded and disease-ridden tenements, worked long hours, and lived in poverty. Children often worked to help support the family. [[Jacob Riis]] wrote ''How the Other Half Lives'' about the lives of immigrants on New York City's Lower East Side to bring greater awareness of the immigrant's living conditions.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Friedman|author2=Brett Friedman|title=Settlement Houses: Improving the Social Welfare of America's Immigrants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NTibovoz4EC|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Rosen Classroom|isbn=978-1-4042-0859-9|pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous settlement house in the United States is [[Chicago]]'s [[Hull House]], founded by [[Jane Addams]] and [[Ellen Gates Starr]] in 1889 after Addams visited Toynbee Hall within the previous two years. Hull House, though, was not a religious-based organization. It focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J. Danilov|title=Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWsrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356|date=26 September 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-9186-9|pages=356–357|chapter=Social Activists}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katharine Coman]], [[Vida Dutton Scudder|Vida Scudder]], and [[Katharine Lee Bates]] were among a group of women who founded Denison House in Boston in 1892. [[Lenox Hill Neighborhood House]], founded in 1894, Friendly Inn Settlement House, founded in 1874, [[Henry Street Settlement]], founded in 1893, [[Hiram House]], founded in 1896, and [[University Settlement Society of New York|University Settlement House]], founded in 1886 and the oldest in the United States, were, like Hull House, important sites for social reform. United Neighborhood Houses of New York is the federation of 38 settlement houses in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhny.org&lt;/ref&gt; These and other settlement houses inspired the establishment of [[settlement school]]s to serve isolated rural communities in [[Appalachia]], such as the [[Hindman Settlement School]] in 1902 and the [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] in 1913.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

By 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states.&lt;ref&gt;Husock, H. (1993). "Bringing back the settlement house". ''Public Welfare'', 51(4).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, there were almost 500 settlement houses in the country.&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357" /&gt; The settlement house concept was continued by [[Dorothy Day]]'s [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker]] "hospitality houses" in the 1930s.

American settlement houses functioned on a philosophy of “scientific philanthropy,” a belief that instead of giving direct relief, charities should give resources to the poor so they could break out of the circle of poverty.  American charity workers feared that the deeply entrenched [[social class]] system in Europe would develop in the United States.

The movement also spread to late imperial Russia, as [[Stanislav Shatsky]] and [[Alexander Zelenko]] set up a network of educational and social institutions in northern [[Moscow]] in 1905, naming it "Setlement" ("{{lang|ru|Сетлемент}}", the English word transliterated to Russian). This network of institutions was closed down by the government in 1908, due to alleged [[Socialism|socialist]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Valkanova, Y. &amp; Brehony, K. J.

==Description==
Today, settlements are still community-focused organizations, providing a range of services including early education, youth guidance and crime intervention, senior programs, and specialized programs for young people who have "aged out" of the foster care system. Since they are staffed by professional employees and students, they no longer require that employees live alongside those they serve.

==Legacy and impact==
Settlement houses influenced [[urban design]] and [[architecture]] in the 20th century. 
For example, [[James Rossant]] of Conklin + Rossant agreed with [[Robert E. Simon]]'s social vision and consciously sought to mix economic backgrounds when drawing up the master plan for [[Reston, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10065">The development and implementation of the '''Special Assistance Program''' in Victorian Primary Schools during the period 1979 - 1982 constituted the most significant innovation in the provision of special education services to children experiencing learning difficulties and in addressing declining literacy and numeracy standards. Up until the political directive to initiate this program was given, there had been no policy within the ''Department of Education and Early Childhood Development'' directing Principals of Primary Schools to develop special programs for pupils at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, H. F. (1982) ''The Development of the Role of Special Assistance Resource Teacher in Primary Schools: the Utilisation of a Needs Assessment Technique to Identify and Assess the Requirements of Personnel in the Implementation of the Special Assistance Program in Schools'' Monash University, M.Ed Minor thesis. p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/AddressingDecliningLiteracyAndNumeracySkillsInVictorianPrimarySchools#page/n0/mode/1up]

==Declining literacy and numeracy skills==
From the early 1960s, the Education Department of Victoria (Australia), had developed an extensive range of programs in primary schools that sought to develop the individual ability of each pupil. Also, the ratio of pupils to teachers in schools had been significantly reduced over time and schools had become much more independent in the development of school based remedial programs.

In spite of this, there existed large numbers of children in Victorian primary and secondary schools urgently in need of special assistance in the essential skills of literacy and numeracy. This situation was reflected in the [[Australian Parliament]]'s House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties in 1976. The committee had commissioned research by the [[Australian Council for Educational Research]] (ACER) that found that 15% to 20% of children completing their primary education had not achieved a functional level of literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of Australia, Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties 1974-76 (14 October 1976) ''Learning Difficulties in Children and Adults''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government intervention==
In late May 1979, within a month of being reelected, the Hamer Liberal Government announced Victoria's first major review of its educational policies for more than 50 years.

Anticipating the new direction, in July 1979, the Assistant Minister of Education, [[Norman Lacy]] established a ''Ministerial Committee on Special Assistance Programs''.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, The Hon. Norman MP, Minister of Educational Services (9 September 1981) ''The Special Assistance Program - A Ministerial Statement on New Directions in Literacy and Numeracy'', Legislative Assembly, Parliament of Victoria&lt;/ref&gt; The committee consisted of people drawn from school staffs, special education facilities, teacher training institutions and the Education Department administration. The committee's report was the basis upon which the ''Special Assistance Program'' was established.[https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement_912/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement#page/n0/mode/1up]

The process for the establishment of the ''Special Assistance Program'' in Victorian Primary Schools&lt;ref&gt;Letters to the Editor, (10 July 1980) ''The Age Newspaper'', Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; was outlined in a speech Mr Lacy delivered to ''[[Special Assistance Resource Teacher]]s'' (SARTs) at a seminar held at Hawthorn State College (Victoria, Australia) on 15 December 1980.[https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech_862/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech#page/n0/mode/1up] In it he announced the most significant development in remedial education in Victoria with a strategic plan for addressing falling literacy and numeracy standards. The totally new component of the [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/29777 ''Special Assistance Program''] was the provision of 1000 SARTs for "the delivery of services to children with special needs." These designated teachers were given "a major on-site school responsibility for facilitating a productive relationship between parents and pupils and teachers."&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, The Hon. Norman MP, Assistant Minister of Education (15 December 1980), ''The Special Assistance Program'' - a speech at the Opening of the Seminar of Special Assistance Resource Teachers at the Hawthorn State College&lt;/ref&gt; The program involved the training of these primary teachers as SARTs and their placement in schools. Their role was the early detection and remediation of children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy.&lt;ref name="TheHon"&gt;Lacy, The Hon. Norman MP, Minister of Educational Services, (9 September 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, M. K. (1980). ''Memorandum to Heads of Schools and District Inspectors on Special Assistance Programs in Primary Schools'', Reprinted in Australian Journal of Remedial Education, 12 (4), 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, Josephine C. (2006)''A History of Learning Difficulties Australia: part three – the Journal'', Australian Journal of Learning Disabilities Volume 11, Number 2, 2006, pp. 73-81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Assistance Resource Teachers==
The core element of this substantial change in the delivery of special educational services to children was the new role of the school based ''[[Special Assistance Resource Teacher]]'' (SART) which was the focus of this world-first breakthrough in class room integration of pupils experiencing learning difficulties. The role incorporated all the elements of the service previously performed by external consultants visiting schools.[https://archive.org/stream/AddressingDecliningLiteracyAndNumeracySkillsInVictorianPrimarySchools#page/n0/mode/1up]

As a result, from the beginning of the 1981 school year SARTs were designated by their schools and appointed to the 575 primary schools with enrolments of greater than 300 pupils. They were manadated to establish the ''Special Assistance Program'' in their schools. The Education Department's Special Services Division and the Primary Division monitored the progress of the implementation and produced a number of evaluative reports that were presented to the Minister.&lt;ref name="TheHon" /&gt;

From the beginning of the 1982 school year, schools with an enrolment of between 150 and 300 pupils designated and appointed a SART to carry out the role on a half-time basis.  This resulted in and additional 302 primary schools in Victoria having a school based resource teacher, bringing the total to 877 schools. It was not planned to designate a SART at schools with less than 150 pupils.  At such schools it was planned that the Principal or an appointed staff member would access services from the Special Assistance Resource Centres for children at these schools in need of such services.&lt;ref name="TheHon" /&gt;

==In-service training courses for SARTs==
A major component of stage one was the in-service education component for the SARTs designated by their schools for the new role. A survey of the qualifications and experience of the 575 designated SARTs was undertaken to assess their training requirements. The responses indicated that 200 of the designated teachers had already completed special education training courses. Of these 102 were also experienced in special education teaching. As well 28 of the 375 remaining designated teachers were experienced special education teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, L. (1983). ''SART Program'', AREA Bulletin, 15 (3), 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt; AREA shared a concern that teachers undertaking SART duties were not qualified in special education, but their proposals to the course committee were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, Josephine C. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Assistance Resource Centres==
The Report of the Victorian Ministerial Committee on Special Assistance Programs (1980), in one of its major recommendations, identified the need to reorganise and integrate the range of specialist professional services available (external to the school) into a single co-ordinated service. To implement this recommendation, [[Norman Lacy]] established a Working Party within the Victorian Education Department to examine and report on the means to achieve this objective.

Early in 1981, work began on planning for the reorganisation all the relevant special education services provided by the Education Department into a single co-ordinated service delivery system under the ''Special Assistance Program''.

As a result, a reorganised multi-disciplinary service was created on a "one stop" referral basis through 50 statewide ''Special Assistance Resource Centres'' allocated one to each Primary Education Inspectoral District throughout Victoria. the professional disciplines offered at each centre included: educational psychology, social work, speech therapy and special education. The availability of these services to primary schools was accessed and co-ordinated by the designated SART within each school and in schools with less than 150 pupils by the Principal.

==Demise==
In April 1982, the Cain Labor Government was elected with commitments to the VTU including the reduction of class sizes in primary schools by redeploying SARTs back to class teaching roles.

AREA reported that "the SART concept would eventually give way to new policies under the Department of Education integration program. By 1982 SAR teachers were no longer being appointed to primary schools, leaving individual schools to decide whether to appoint a SAR teacher from their staffing allocation. There was no indication of what curriculum and in-service support would be provided for schools conducting a special assistance program..."&lt;ref&gt;AREA Bulletin, March 1983Vol 15 No 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structured English Immersion (SEI)''' is a technique for rapidly teaching English to [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|English Language Learners]].  The term was coined by Keith Baker and Adriana de Kanter in a 1983 recommendation to schools to make use of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's]] successful [[French immersion]] programs.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian model was developed to encourage bilingualism through immersing Anglophones in the minority language and replaced [[language policies of the Canadian provinces and territories|many English-only laws in various Canadian provinces]] before the 1960s, while in the United States the same approach was advocated to force minority speakers to adopt English.

More recently, SEI has been defined as a methodology in which English language learners (ELLs) learn English through structured and sequential lessons. Specially developed for ELLs, these lessons are  based, to a large degree, on the mainstream curricula. (Haver, Johanna J., ''Structured English Immersion,'' Corwin Press, 2002)

In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Horne v. Flores, the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI is significantly more effective than [[bilingual education]]. Findings of the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004 strongly support this conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author      = SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SEI is mandatory in California, Arizona and Massachusetts where voter initiatives opted to restrict the use of bilingual education in preference for SEI.

== SEI Framework ==
Only Arizona mandates that its public schools implement SEI models as follows:
* Significant amounts of the school day are dedicated to the explicit teaching of the English language, and students are grouped for this instruction according to their level of English proficiency.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "The English language is the main content of SEI instruction. Academic content plays a supporting, but subordinate, role."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "English is the language of instruction; students and teachers are expected to speak, read, and write in English."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Teachers use instructional methods that treat English as a foreign language."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Students learn discrete English grammar skills."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Rigorous time lines are established for students to exit from the program."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* SEI program graduates continue to receive support services until they are reclassified as "fluent English proficient" whereby Federal law then requires students be monitored for two years after reclassification.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5879">'''Student Achievement and School Accountability Programs''' ('''SASA''') is a division of the [[Office of Elementary and Secondary Education]] (OESE) of the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) that administers programs of financial assistance to [[State education agency|State]] and [[Local Education Agency|local education agencies]] (LEA) and to colleges and universities. Under [[Title I]] of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA) of 1965, SASA administers several Title I programs of supplementary instruction and other services. This includes programs such as the Improving Basic Programs Operated by LEAs and the Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children Who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk. Under [[Title III]] of the ESEA, SASA administers the State Formula Grant Program for English Language Acquisition and Language Enhancement. SASA also administers the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program authorized by the [[McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] (P.L. 100-77).

== Organization ==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
SASA is headed by a Director who reports to the Assistant Secretary and/or Deputy Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education. The current director is Dr. Zollie Stevenson, Jr.

SASA is divided into six Program Groups:

=== Policy Coordination Group ===
The Policy Coordination Group is responsible for policy coordination and develops policy guidance that clarifies for implementation purposes the principal themes of the President's education blueprint. Title I formula grant allocations are also managed by this group as is the programmatic focus on services to non-public schools. The group influences the educational community and others who need to understand the parameters for implementing Title I requirements.

=== Standards and Assessments Group ===
The Standards and Assessments Group is responsible for ensuring that States develop the standards and assessment systems required by the new [[Title I]]. The group provides direct technical assistance to States and also provides specialized technical assistance through external experts for longer term interventions for States with significant assessment issues. They also work with the States to help them comply in a manner that results in systems of standards and assessments that drive instructional change.

=== Instructional Change Group ===
The Instructional Change Group is responsible for changing the face of teaching and learning in [[Title I]] schools in a manner that focuses on what works to generate improved results for children. This unit helps technical assistance providers work with schools to implement Title I programs in ways that focus on improving classroom instruction, including the involvement of parents in their child's education. In addition, this unit works with States to design, implement, and evaluate State systems of support for making Title I targeted assistance and schoolwide programs more effective vehicles for instructional change and for turning around low-performing schools. This group also has responsibility for working with content and regional comprehensive centers funded by the Department to develop strategies and materials to aid schools in corrective action and restructuring.

=== Monitoring Group ===
The Monitoring Group is responsible for instituting a process of achievement-focused monitoring for compliance with the implementation of [[Title I]], Parts A, B and D and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Education programs. States not fully compliant are presented with the opportunity to take corrective actions to address identified concerns. It is through the monitoring process that this group influences the extent to which States, school districts, and schools consider how they are using federal education resources to improve student achievement.

=== Accountability Group ===
The Accountability Group is responsible for ensuring that States develop and update the accountability systems used to hold school districts and schools responsible for student achievement under [[Title I]], Part A as amended by the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB). This group reviews and recommends approval or disapproval of annual State amendments to their Title I required accountability plans and orchestrates the peer review process for the growth model accountability pilot program authorized by the Secretary. The group will also be involved with managing the development/refinement of data definitions associated with NCLB accountability and the annual Consolidated State Performance Report. The group will provide direct technical assistance to States and also provides specialized TA through external experts for longer term interventions for States with significant assessment and accountability issues. They also will work with the States to help them comply in a manner that results in systems of standards and assessments that drive instructional change.

=== Title III State Formula Grants Group ===
The Title III State Formula Grants Group is responsible for the administration of the [[Title III]] State formula grant program. The group works collaboratively with the [[Office of English Language Acquisition]] and the other SASA groups to develop policy guidance, monitor program compliance, ensure program accountability, and provide State and local educational agencies with technical assistance to develop and enhance their capacity for developing standards and assessment systems and providing high quality language instruction educational programs for [[English language learners]].

A '''Sudbury school''' is a type of school, usually for the [[K-12 (education)|K-12]] age range, where students have complete responsibility for their own education, and the school is run by [[direct democracy]] in which students and staff are almost equals.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Arthur K.|title=Exemplars of curriculum theory|publisher=Eye on Education|year=2004|isbn=1-930556-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students independently decide what to do with their time, and tend to learn as a by-product of ordinary experience rather than through coursework. There is no predetermined educational [[syllabus]], prescriptive [[curriculum]] or standardized instruction. This is a form of [[democratic education]].  [[Daniel Greenberg (educator)|Daniel Greenberg]], one of the founders of the original Sudbury Model school, writes that the two things that distinguish a Sudbury Model school are that everyone - adults and children - are treated equally and that there is no authority other than that granted by the [[consent of the governed]].&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Daniel|title=A Place to Grow|publisher=Sudbury Valley School Press|year=2016|isbn=1-888947-26-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While each Sudbury Model school operates independently and determines their own policies and procedures, they share a common culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookstore.sudburyvalley.org/product/cyberspace-collection The 2002 Collection], Sudbury Valley School Press, pp5-14&lt;/ref&gt; The intended culture within a Sudbury school has been described with such words as freedom, trust, respect, responsibility and democracy.

The name 'Sudbury' originates from the [[Sudbury Valley School]], founded in 1968 in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]], near [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]]. Though there is no formal or regulated definition of a Sudbury Model school, there are now [[List of Sudbury schools|more than 60 schools that identify themselves with Sudbury]] around the world. Some, though not all, include "Sudbury" in their name. These schools operate as independent entities and are not formally associated in any way.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

==Underlying beliefs==

Sudbury schools are based on:&lt;ref&gt;[https://sudburyvalley.org/node/311 The Birth of a New Paradigm for Education] by Dan Greenberg in The Sudbury Valley School Experience, 3rd ed. (Sudbury Valley School Press; Framingham, 1992), p. 81ff&lt;/ref&gt;

# The educational belief that children are extremely good at (and therefore do not need to be taught) the main behaviors they will need as adults, such as creativity, imagination, alertness, curiosity, thoughtfulness, responsibility, and judgement. What children lack is experience, which can be gained if adults guide students in open ways.
# The [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] belief that having full democratic rights in childhood is the best way to become an adult who is comfortable functioning within a democracy.

"The fundamental premises of the school are simple: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mimsy Sadofsky|author2=Daniel Greenberg|title=The Kingdom of Childhood: Growing Up at Sudbury Valley School|url=https://bookstore.sudburyvalley.org/product/kingdom-childhood|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=1994|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School Press|isbn=978-1-888947-02-1}}, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

==School democracy==
All aspects of governing a Sudbury School are determined by the weekly School Meeting, modeled after the traditional [[New England]] [[town meeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students revel in free-for-all|date=1992-04-19|work=Telegram &amp; Gazette|location=Worcester, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; School Meeting passes, amends and repeals school rules, manages the school's budget, and decides on hiring and firing of staff. Each individual present — including students and staff — has an equal vote, and most decisions are made by simple majority&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Woodstock, a nonschool with nonteachers.(Hudson Valley Sudbury School, Woodstock, New York)|last=Rowe|first=Claudia|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2002-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School rules are normally compiled in a law book, updated repeatedly over time, which forms the school's [[code (law)|code of law]]. Usually, there is a set procedure to handle complaints, and most of the schools follow guidelines that respect the idea of [[due process]] of law. There are usually rules requiring an investigation, a [[hearing (law)|hearing]], a [[trial (law)|trial]], a [[sentence (law)|sentence]], and allowing for an [[appeal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Feldman|first=Jay|title=The Moral Behavior of Children and Adolescents at a Democratic School|series=Paper presented at 82nd [[American Educational Research Association]] Meeting|location=[[Seattle]]|year=2001|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED453128}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally following the philosophy that students face the consequences of their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Nation of Wimps: The High Cost of Invasive Parenting|last=Marano|first=Hara Estroff|year=2008|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-7679-2403-7|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==
The Sudbury pedagogical philosophy may be summarized as the following:
Learning is a natural by-product of all human activity.&lt;ref name="Holzman"&gt;{{cite book|title= Schools for Growth: Radical Alternatives To Current Education Models|last= Holzman|first= Lois|authorlink= Lois Holzman|year= 1997|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location= United Kingdom|isbn= 0-8058-2357-3|pages= 97–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Learning is self-initiated and self-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-governed, Sudbury Valley School begins in Massachusetts in History of Education: Selected Moments of the 20th Century|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/research/edu20/moments/1968sudbury.html|first=Daniel|last=Schugurensky|work=[[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]], [[University of Toronto]]|year=2003|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational model states that there are many ways to learn and that learning is a process someone does, not a process that is done to him or her;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) The Sudbury Valley School Experience [http://bookstore.sudburyvalley.org/product/sudbury-valley-school-experience ''Back to Basics'']. Retrieved, December 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model the presence and guidance of a teacher is not necessary.

The free exchange of ideas and free conversation and interplay between people provides broad exposure to areas that may prove relevant and interesting to students. Students are of all mixed ages. The older students learn from younger students and vice versa. The presence of older students provides role models, both positive and negative, for younger students.  The pervasiveness of play has led to a recurring observation by first-time visitors to a Sudbury school that the students appear to be in perpetual "[[recess (break)|recess]]".&lt;ref name="Holzman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/200809/why-we-should-stop-segregating-children-age-part-i-the-value-play-in-the-z|title=Why We Should Stop Segregating Children by Age: Part I--The Value of Play in the Zone of Proximal Development |date=2008-09-09|accessdate=2009-10-25 |last=Gray |first=Peter |publisher=Psychology Today |authorlink=Peter Gray (psychologist)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Implicitly and explicitly, students are given responsibility for their own education:  The only person designing what a student will learn is the student. Exceptions are when a student asks for a particular class or arranges an [[apprenticeship]]. Sudbury schools do not compare or rank students — the school requires no tests, evaluations, or transcripts.

Reading is treated the same as any other subject: Students learn to read when they choose, or simply by going about their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Harnish (2015). [https://sudburyvalley.org/blog/will-they-ever-learn-read "Will they ever learn to read?"] Sudbury Valley School Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Only a few kids seek any help at all when they decide to learn. Each child seems to have their own method. Some learn from being read to, memorizing the stories and then ultimately reading them. Some learn from cereal boxes, others from game instructions, others from street signs. Some teach themselves letter sounds, others syllables, others whole words. To be honest, we rarely know how they do it, and they rarely tell us."&lt;ref name="Greenberg1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Greenberg|title=Free at Last: The Sudbury Valley School Press|url=https://bookstore.sudburyvalley.org/product/free-last|accessdate=1 May 2013|date=1 June 1995|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School Press|isbn=978-1-888947-00-7}}, p34 &lt;/ref&gt;

Sudbury Valley School claims that all of their students have learned to read. While students learn to read at a wide variety of ages, there appears to be no drawback to learning to read later: No one who meets their older students could guess the age at which they first learned to read.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Taylor Gatto (2000-2003) The Underground History of American Education - A Schoolteacher's Intimate Investigation Into The Problem Of Modern Schooling, Chapter Three - Eyeless In Gaza, [http://johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3d.htm ''The Sudbury Valley School''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102154119/http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3d.htm |date=2010-01-02 }}. Retrieved, December 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with related models==

The model differs in some ways from other types of democratic schools and [[anarchistic free school|free schools]], but there are many similarities:
* '''De-emphasis of [[class (education)|classes]]:''' There is no curriculum or set of required courses. Instead learner interest guides things, with students studying what they want to study.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; There are generally no classrooms, just rooms where people choose to congregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peramas|first=Mary|title=The Sudbury School and Influences of Psychoanalytic Theory on Student-Controlled Education|journal=Essays in Education|volume=19|pages=119(15)|date=Winter 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Age mixing:''' students are not separated into age-groups of any kind and are allowed to mix freely, interacting with those younger and older than themselves; free age-mixing is emphasized as a powerful tool for learning and development in all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psichi.org/Pubs/Articles/Article_645.aspx |title=Nature's Powerful Tutors; The Educative Functions of Free Play |accessdate=2009-07-25 |publisher=The National Honor Society in Psychology |last=Gray |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Gray (psychologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Autonomous democracy:''' parents have limited involvement or no involvement in the school administration; Sudbury schools are run by a democratic school meeting where the students and staff participate exclusively and equally. Such meetings are also the sole authority on hiring and firing of staff, unlike most other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Promises Kept|last= Gross|first= Steven J.|year= 2004|publisher=[[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]]|location= United States|isbn= 0-87120-973-X|page= 140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teaching abroad''' is a [[catch phrase]] used in [[first world]] countries for temporary teaching assignments outside of the teacher's home country.

==Overview of different programs==
There are many different programs that exist to help people to teach abroad. If a person knows that they want to teach abroad but they aren't sure if they're able to make the transition, they can pick a teaching program that goes from a semester to a couple years. There are also programs where one can switch positions with a teacher overseas. When picking a program make sure its a credible program. Three often-used paths for American teachers are teaching at a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] school, teaching at an [[international school]], or working independently at any school accepting foreign applicants.

==U.S. Department of Defense==
Teaching at a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) school is much like teaching at a school within the United States.  The schools enroll the children of military and DOD civilian employees.  There are currently 222 public schools in “13 foreign countries, seven states, Guam, and Puerto Rico” (DOD).  There are 8,785 teachers working in these schools.  The DOD works to keep the school atmosphere and level of learning comparable to schools within the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodea.edu DoDEA: The Department of Defense Education Activity]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOD hires only teachers with bachelor's degrees (which must include some course work in education) and teaching experience.  Most placements are for one or two years; teachers are placed at the discretion of the DoD and cannot choose their location.

==International volunteer programs==
Numerous volunteer programs exist in which teachers can teach in foreign schools.  Costs to participate as a volunteer vary depending on the organization, the country and the length of the program.  International volunteer programs usually vary in length from 2 to 12 months.  Volunteers most often teach English but other subjects can also be covered, such as computer skills, AIDS/HIV awareness, science, math, etc.

Volunteer English teaching programs exist in almost all corners of the world.  Some countries with prominent English teaching programs are Chile, Spain, France and Georgia.  Many programs are sponsored by the host nation's ministry of education, such as the Chile's [[English Opens Doors Program|English Opens Doors]] and Korea's [[EPIK]] program.

==International schools==
[[International school]]s are private schools that cater mainly to children who are not nationals of the host country, including the children of the staff of international businesses, international organizations, foreign embassies, missions, or missionary programs. Teachers are often hired on contracts which typically last two years &lt;ref&gt;Savva, M. (2013). International schools as gateways to the intercultural development of North-American teachers. Journal of Research in International Education, 12(3), 214-227. &lt;/ref&gt; Research has indicated that teaching experiences abroad contribute positively to the intercultural development of teachers (Savva, 2013).

==TESOL Certification==
Many teaching positions overseas are for teachers of English, and can involve teaching to all ages, including both children and adults.  Programs are organized by individual schools, national governments (such as the [[JET Programme]] in Japan and [[English Opens Doors Program|English Opens Doors]] in Chile). The University of Missouri-Saint Louis, like many schools, have required their education majors to either pick TESOL or special education to major in for more specificity. This university in particular wants teachers to be more well rounded for future employers. Some programs require [[teaching credential]]s and/or [[teaching English as a foreign language|TESOL certification]].

There is some dispute about the claimed usefulness of brief courses (TEFL, TESOL, etc.) in either becoming an effective teacher or finding employment.  Such courses are sometimes advertised as being important or even required, without stating that they are no substitute for a university degree in [[teaching English as a foreign language]].

==History==
Israel's Compulsory Education Law&lt;ref&gt;CMIP 2000 report, p. 9: "The Compulsory Education Law adopted in 1949, extended in 1968, 1979 and 1999"&lt;/ref&gt; provides free and compulsory education for all children between the ages of 5 to 18, from the last year of kindergarten up to 12th grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Or Kashti |date=25 December 2007 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/knesset-extends-compulsory-education-law-to-12th-grade-1.235897 |title=Knesset extends compulsory education law to 12th grade |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments of Hebrew textbooks in relation to their depiction of Arabs==

===''Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace'' findings===
An analysis of Israeli textbooks in 2000 by the [[Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace]] (CMIP), now known as the Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education, found that the legitimacy of the State of Israel as an independent Jewish state on the territory of the Land of Israel and the immigration of Jews to the country was never questioned. There was no indoctrination against the Arabs as a nation, nor a negative presentation of Islam. Islam, Arab culture and the Arabs' contribution to human civilization were presented in a positive light. No book called for violence or war. Many books express the yearning for peace between Israel and the Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecomtrade.co.il/eMall/shops/1559/imgbank/Israeli%20Report%20-%20September%202000.pdf CMIP 2000 report, p. 6 Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace report]&lt;/ref&gt;

In textbooks for state-run schools, there was an effort to remove stereotypes and educate towards tolerance. In some textbooks for the Orthodox Jewish community, the researchers found derogatory adjectives, prejudices, patronizing expressions and disrespect toward Arabs. The Arab leadership was portrayed as motivated by an eternal hatred independent of historical circumstances. In textbooks for every age, Israel's wars are described as justified wars of defense, and the Arabs held responsible for them.&lt;ref&gt;CMIP 2000 report, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]] is attributed to the fact that the Arabs fled from their homes. Only a few textbooks stated that some refugees were expelled by Israel or were forced to flee through threats. Some do not mention the Palestinian exodus at all.&lt;ref&gt;CMIP 2000 report, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, [[Islam]] is described with respect in both the general the religious state-run educational streams. Many books elaborate in detail how [[Muhammad]] established Islam and explain its fundamentals in a factual, objective manner. Many books highlight positive aspects in Islam. The language is factual and devoid of offensive terms and stereotypes. Sites holy to both Jews and Muslims are not presented as exclusively Jewish and the Arabs' attachment to these sites is taught. The students are even taught about the Muslims affinity to Jerusalem, although, the focus is on the religious, rather than the political dimension.&lt;ref name="CMIP 2000 report, p.7"&gt;CMIP 2000 report, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The CIMP report found that it was only in the ultra-orthodox stream that textbooks contained prejudice, patronizing expressions and disrespect to Arabs.&lt;ref name=CMIP_rpt2000&gt;[http://www.teachkidspeace.org/reports/IsraeliTextbooks2000.pdf Arabs and Palestinians in Israeli Textbooks, September 2000 Report] by [[Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace]] (also available at [http://www.edume.org]), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

The report further stated that in textbooks of both the general state-run network and the religious state-run network, there was a genuine effort to remove stereotypes and to build a foundation for coexistence and mutual respect between the two peoples. There are many stories that describe friendships between Jews and Arabs in Islamic countries and in Israel even in times of war. There are stories of Jews helping Arabs in daily life and in war as well as stories of Arabs rescuing Jews from physical harm and helping Jews to maintain their religion and identity. In many literary anthologies there are stories about the daily life of Arabs written by Arab authors. Some stories deal with the tensions created by the transition from a traditional society with its values and customs, to a modern western society.&lt;ref name="CMIP 2000 report, p.7"/&gt; In some books in the ultra-orthodox network relations between Arabs and Jews were portrayed in negative terms.  The official list of textbooks referred to is not compulsory, but was an indication of the Ministry of Education's recommendations, as published in a memo signed by the Ministry's Director.&lt;ref name=CMIP_rpt2000/&gt;

;2001 update
CMIP states that no negative changes were noted in the new textbooks with regard to the image of the Arabs, the description of the conflict, the presentation of Islam, questions of war and peace and education to tolerance and conciliation. On the contrary, the positive trends noted in the earlier report were strengthened. The textbooks of the ultra-Orthodox schools continued to use language conveying an air of superiority.

Maps of Israel included all the territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan. Many textbooks showed maps of the Middle East on which only Israel's name appeared, with the territories of the surrounding Arab countries left blank.&lt;ref name=CMIP_rpt2001&gt;[http://www.teachkidspeace.org/reports/IsraeliTextbooks2002.pdf 2002 Update by CMIP]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2011}}

===Other studies===
In his 2004 article "The Arab Image in Hebrew School Textbooks", Dan Bar-Tal of [[Tel Aviv University]] studied 124 textbooks used in Israeli schools. He concluded that generations of Israeli Jews have been taught a negative and often delegitimizing view of Arabs. He claims Arabs are portrayed in these textbooks as primitive, inferior in comparison to Jews, violent, untrustworthy, fanatic, treacherous and aggressive. While history books in the elementary schools hardly mentioned Arabs, the high school textbooks that covered the Arab–Jewish conflict stereotyped Arabs negatively, as intransigent and uncompromising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=len traubman|title=Reports on Palestinian kids' hatred grossly exaggerated|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/21668/reports-on-palestinian-kids-hatred-grossly-exaggerated/|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=[[j.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nurit Peled-Elhanan]], a professor of language and education at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], published ''Palestine in Israeli School Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education'', an account of her study of the contents of Israeli school books. She asserts that the books promote [[racism]] against and negative images of Arabs, and that they prepare young Israelis for their compulsory military service. After examining "hundreds and hundreds" of books, Peled-Elhanan claims she did not find one photograph that depicted an Arab as a "normal person". She has stated that the most important finding in the books she studied concerns the historical narrative of events in 1948, the year in which Israel fought a war to establish itself as an independent state. She claims that the killing of Palestinians is depicted as something that was necessary for the survival of the nascent Jewish state. "It's not that the massacres are denied, they are represented in Israeli school books as something that in the long run was good for the Jewish state."&lt;ref name=Elhanan&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Academic claims Israeli school textbooks contain bias|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/israeli-school-racism-claim|accessdate=8 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he Israeli version of events are stated as objective facts, while the Palestinian-Arab versions are stated as possibility, realized in openings such as 'According to the Arab version' ... [or] 'Dier [sic.] Yassin became a myth in the Palestinian narrative ... a horrifying negative image of the Jewish conqueror in the eyes of Israel's Arabs'.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine in Israeli School Books'', pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to previous studies of Israeli school textbooks, Peled-Elhanan states that, despite some signs of improvement in the 1990s, the more recent books do not ignore, but justify, issues such as the Nakba. For example, in all the books mentioning Deir Yassin, the massacre is justified because: "the slaughter of friendly Palestinians brought about the flight of other Palestinians which enabled the establishment of a coherent Jewish state."&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine in Israeli School Books'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

She also states that contrary to the hope of previous studies "for 'the appearance of a new narrative in [Israeli] history textbooks' ... some of the most recent school books (2003–09) regress to the 'first generation' [1950s] accounts — when archival information was less accessible — and are, like them 'replete with bias, prejudice, errors, [and] misrepresentations'" (''Palestine in Israeli School Books'', p. 228).

In 2013, it was reported that Israeli science textbook publishers had been instructed to remove details of "human reproduction, pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted diseases from science textbooks used in state religious junior high schools as well as from their teacher manuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lior Dattel |author2=Yarden Skop |title=Israeli Science Textbook Publishers Ordered To Censor Human Reproduction |url=http://forward.com/articles/183346/israeli-science-textbook-publishers-ordered-to-cen/ &lt;!-- original: http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.545015 --&gt; |accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=The Forward|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabic textbooks==

According to a 2011 report by the Arab Cultural Association, Arabic textbooks provided to third grade to ninth grade students in Israeli schools contained at least 16,255 mistakes. The report was based on a study and examination of textbooks in all subjects by a committee, headed by Dr. Elias Atallah. Association director Dr. Rawda Atallah said the findings were not surprising, since they were similar to the findings of a previous study published in November 2009, which reported that more than 4,000 mistakes in language and syntax were found in textbooks for second grade students in Arab schools. Researchers also spoke about the way in which Arab students' cultural and national identities are covered. For example, while textbooks state that Jews and non-Jews live in the Galilee, the word "Arab" is never mentioned. Dr. George Mansour, who examined the history textbooks, reported that they ignored the presence of the Arab-Palestinian people in Israel and stressed the Promised Land of the Jewish people: "There is a process of de-Palestinization, instilling of the Zionist narrative and minimizing of Arab culture," reported Dr. Mansour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-s-textbooks-in-arabic-are-full-of-mistakes-study-finds-1.360617|title=Israel textbooks in Arabic are full of mistakes|newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date= 9 May 2011| author= Jack Khoury |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nakba terminology==
Israel has ordered the word [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]] to be removed from Israeli Arab textbooks. The term was introduced in books for use in Arab schools in 2007 when the Education Ministry was run by [[Yuli Tamir]] of the Labour party. Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] justified the ban by saying that the term was "propaganda against Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLM2389 |title=Israel bans "catastrophe" term from Arab schools |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:hidden-curriculum-cover.jpg|thumbnail|''The Hidden Curriculum'' (1973 edition)]]

'''''The Hidden Curriculum''''' (1970) is a book by the psychiatrist Benson R. Snyder,&lt;ref name="Snyder1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benson R. Snyder |title=The Hidden Curriculum |year=1971 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |isbn=0-394-42842-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the then-Dean of Institute Relations at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benson Rowell Snyder, former psychiatrist-in-chief at MIT, dies at 89 |url=http://news.mit.edu/2012/obit-snyder |newspaper=MIT News |date=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Snyder advances a thesis that much of campus conflict and students' personal anxiety is caused by unstated academic and social norms. These hidden norms affect the ability to develop independently or think creatively, and form what Snyder calls the [[hidden curriculum]].  He illustrates his thesis with psychological studies and other research conducted at MIT and [[Wellesley College]].

==Summary==
The phrase "hidden curriculum" was coined by Philip Jackson in his 1968 book entitled ''Life in Classrooms'', in a section about the need for students to master the institutional expectations of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Philip Wesley Jackson |title=Life in Classrooms |date=1968 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston}} Reprinted as {{cite book |author=Philip Wesley Jackson |title=Life in Classrooms |year=1990|publisher=Teachers College Press |isbn=978-0-8077-7005-4 |pages=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder develops this with observations of particular institutions.&lt;ref name=ISSTL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doceo.co.uk/tools/hidden.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414182209/http://www.doceo.co.uk/tools/hidden.htm |archivedate=2017-04-14 |df= }} Sending Messages:
Managing the Hidden Curriculum; second conference of the International Society for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Vancouver B.C., 14–16 October 2005) "For our purposes in higher education, therefore, let us set aside most of the above line of debate, and start with Snyder (1971). Snyder's observations pre-figured all the later research on "Deep" and "Surface" learning; he noted that at MIT in the 'fifties and 'sixties, the curriculum was getting more and more crowded as technological knowledge grew, and so undergraduates were taking "short cuts" in their learning. They could not absorb everything, so they strategically tried to guess what would be assessed, for example, and revised only that. Snyder's additional insight, however, was to realise that unintentionally the Institute was teaching them to act strategically, hence the term "hidden curriculum".''

Under Creative Commons License: Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives&lt;/ref&gt;  Snyder then addresses the question of why students &amp;mdash; even or especially the most [[gifted]] &amp;mdash; turn away from education. Even honest efforts to enrich curricula frequently fail, says Snyder, thanks to the importance of the tacit and unwritten understanding.  He says that while some students do not realize there is a disjunction between the two curricula, in a demanding environment, students develop strategies to cope with the requirements they face.&lt;ref name = ISSTL /&gt;

Many students find they can not possibly complete all the work assigned them; they learn to neglect some of it. Some student groups maintain files of past examinations which only worsen this situation.&lt;ref name = ISSTL /&gt;

The difference between the formal and real requirements produced considerable dissonance among the students and resulted in cynicism, scorn, and hypocrisy among students, and particular difficulty for minority students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Hafferty |editor-first1=Frederick W. |editor-last2=O'Donnell |editor-first2=Joseph F.  |title=The Hidden Curriculum in Health Professional Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSXZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |accessdate=November 1, 2016 |year=2015 |publisher=Dartmouth |isbn=978-1611686609 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No part of the university community, writes Snyder, neither the professors, the administration nor the students, desires the end result created by this process.&lt;ref name = ISSTL /&gt;

The [[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]] said the book "will gain recognition as one of the more cogent 'college unrest' books" and that it presents a "most provocative thesis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1971feb20 [[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)]] ] Book review, 20 Feb 1971, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been cited many times in studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/0260293980230406 | volume=23 | title=The Construction of the Hidden Curriculum: messages and meanings in the assessment of student learning | year=1998 | journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education | pages=391–402 | author=Sambell Kay, McDowell Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/0022027930250404 | volume=25 | title=Exposing the hidden curriculum | year=1993 | journal=Journal of Curriculum Studies | pages=343–358 | author=Portelli John P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NWFBTrainingBuses.png|thumb|300px|Two training buses of [[New World First Bus]] in [[Hong Kong]].]]
A '''training bus''' is a special kind of [[bus]] or [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] that is used by [[list of bus operating companies|bus operators]] for training the driving skills of bus drivers. It is also used to train the driving skill of a person who is learning to become a bus driver. Driving a training bus on the road is an important part of driving training, as it is the most practical to train one's driving skill.

A training bus is usually a bus that has been retired from the passenger-serving fleet. Some bus companies may like to repaint the bus with a special livery for training bus after the bus is retired from the passenger-serving fleet, which is usually white or a plainer version of the company's regular livery. Some bus companies may also remove most of the facilities (such as passenger seats) from a training bus, so that those facilities can be installed onto some newer buses. On a training bus, there is usually another seat for the [[driving instructor]] (trainer) next to the driver's seat. This allows the instructor to monitor how trainee is driving and give appropriate instruction when necessary.

==Hong Kong==
The use of training buses for practical training is especially popular among the [[:Category:Bus companies of Hong Kong|Hong Kong franchised bus companies]]. In [[Hong Kong]], training buses are known in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as "訓練巴士" ([[pinyin]]: Xùn liàn bā Shì). Training buses used in Hong Kong, such as those used at [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], are typically buses that are older buses and retired from its main bus fleet, therefore only used for training purposes and not for passenger services.  However, for route training and other service or safety improvement trainings, in-service buses may be used.

==Other places==
In contrast, other jurisdictions may use active-service buses for training; this will be at non-peak service times when more buses are available. The head sign may be set to read 'TRAINING', and a sign mounted at the rear as well.

===Toronto===
The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] uses training buses on regular routes or roads with sign display the bus as a training bus for real life training for new drivers. The bus will not be in service and will only stop briefly at select bus stops.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1725">A '''video lesson''' or '''lecture''' is a [[video]] which presents educational material for a topic which is to be learned.  

The format may vary.  It might be a video of a teacher speaking to the camera, photographs and text about the topic or some mixture of these.  The [[Khan Academy]] has been successful in teaching mathematics using notes written using [[Yahoo!]]'s doodle pad with a voiceover by [[Salman Khan (educator)]].

'''The Wisconsin Center for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education (WISCAPE)''' was established in 2001 on the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] campus by former UW–Madison Chancellor [[David Ward (university president)|David Ward]].&lt;ref name=Heinen&gt;Heinen, N. “A Rare Look Inward.” Madison Magazine, March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Ward envisioned the center as “a policy [[think tank]], not just an academic think tank,” that would promote cross-disciplinary research and scholarship on [[postsecondary education]], enhance professional development for those working at colleges and universities, and engage the public in a dialogue about the role of postsecondary education in a democratic society.&lt;ref name=Heinen /&gt;

==Areas of focus==
Local and national media have since highlighted the work of the center’s staff, scholars, and affiliates on a variety of postsecondary education issues, including [[Student financial aid in the United States|financial aid]],&lt;ref name=Ziff&gt;Ziff, D. “A Study on Grant Students.” Wisconsin State Journal, July 27, 2008.
