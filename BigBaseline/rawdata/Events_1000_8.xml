'''Alternate ending''' ([[British English]]: '''alternative ending''') is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.

==Examples in film==
Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's [[DVD]] release. These alternative endings are a special type of [[deleted scene]]. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.

Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.

The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:
*''[[1408 (film)|1408]]'': An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like ''The Butterfly Effect'', with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her.
*''[[28 Days Later]]'': Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.
*''[[3 Ninjas]]'': The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'', [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] and [[Showtime MAX]]; international [[DVD]]s have this version, as well.
*''[[Army of Darkness]]'': In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams "I slept too long!"
*''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'': When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...
*''[[Blade: Trinity]]'': The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director [[David S. Goyer]]. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf.
*''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': An alternative ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA.
*''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'': Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his [[umbilical cord]] and dies, [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. This "[[Director's Cut]]" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.
*''[[Child's Play 2]]'': An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.
*''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'': After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mt. Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete).
*''[[Clerks]]'': Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.
*''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of ''three'' of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/alternateversions&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'': In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that Simon's robbery of the Federal Reserve succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. McClane's police career is in ruins, and he is keen to take it out on Gruber, who he invites to play a game called "McClane Says". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself.
*''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'': The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the "real" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, "You happy now?")
*''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'': The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. No one knows why, but they cut the scene out and replaced the ending with a musical ending with the entire cast present and they exit like they do on stage.
*''[[Fatal Attraction]]'': Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex "If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family.
*''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'': Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby.
*''[[Final Destination 2]]'': The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene.
*''[[Final Destination 3]]'': The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision.
*''[[The Final Destination]]'': In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, "The chain is broken." Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision.
*''[[Final Destination 5]]'': In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror.
*''[[First Blood]]'': In an alternative ending, Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004.
*''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'': Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.
*''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'': An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.
*''[[Game of Death]]'': This movie has two alternative endings. In the [[Hong Kong]] [[Cantonese]]  print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of [[Bruce Lee]]. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending.
*''[[Happy Death Day]]'': An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory.
*''[[Hide and Seek (2005 film)|Hide and Seek]]'': This movie had many different endings on whether [[Dakota Fanning]]'s character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home.
*''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'': The "Monster Woman" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a "cure" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the "Alpha Monster" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the "Monster Woman" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the "Alpha Monster" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer)
*''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'': In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads "I still know". This scene was used in the trailer for the film.
*''[[Infernal Affairs]]'': In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming ([[Andy Lau]]) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime.
*''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'': In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed.
*''[[Men in Black II]]'': The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOS. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot.
* ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'': In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate.
*''[[Paranormal Activity]]'': In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.
*''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'': Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel "do you believe in fate?" and they kiss. It is assumed he then proposes to her because it fades to black at that point.
*''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'': Both main characters are killed off by a man they forgot to shoot down.
*''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'': [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] defeats [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]] by split decision. In the actual movie, it is reversed.
*''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'': Deirdre is seen on the stairs next to the café considering joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened.
*''[[Scream 3]]'': When [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] enters the screening room, he does not have a white sheet covering him. After Roman notices [[Sidney Prescott]] has disappeared after he supposedly killed her, he searches the screening room for her shouting and telling her all the doors are locked, most of the scene shows Sidney's point of view which was not shown in the actual ending. Also, Kincaid does not enter the screening room in this ending.
*''[[Scary Movie 3]]'': Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand a specific spot. Cody goes there, and is followed by [[Santa Claus]]. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]]. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from ''The Matrix'' and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be [[M. Night Shyamalan]].
*''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'': Writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, completed two separate drafts of the ending. The first was used in the theatrical edition of the film. In the second, John Doe is killed by Somerset instead of Mills. This alternate ending sequence was storyboarded and is included in the published script, but never filmed, however it does appear on an extra disk on the DVD Release.
*''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'': Sharon Stone and the killer fly over a volcano when the killer suddenly confesses his crimes. He then veers the aircraft into the volcano as the end credits roll and leaves the audience to decide whether they survive.
*''[[Smokin' Aces]]'': Rather than pulling the life support cords of Israel and Sparazza as he does in the used ending, he instead draws his weapon and empties his pistol into them.
*''[[Super Troopers]]'': Another ending was filmed that starts the same way as the real ending; by the police station being closed down. This time, the former officers are now working in a meat packing plant. They talk to their boss saying that bad meat should not be sent out for people to buy, and the boss says to do it any way. At this point the officers take off their jacket to reveal that they are now local police officers and chase him throughout the meat packing plant.
*''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'': The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. In a companion scene to the alternative ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring many billion dollars to various charities before continuing his trip.
*''[[The Terminator]]'': The alternative ending, included in some DVD releases, shows the cleanup and police response at the factory shortly after the final battle between Kyle and the terminator. A group of company representatives find the terminator wreckage and decide to hide it from police and have it analyzed. The film then ends by the screen panning out to show that the factory was owned by Cyberdyne Systems. The sequel is based on this alternative ending.
*''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'': The alternative ending shows Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John Connor is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'': Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the diamond into the ocean.
*''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'': While Nicole and Michèle waiting in front of Stade Charléty, there was a duel between André and Jacques in the French football stadium. Jacques is shot down by a sniper. This ending was poorly received by audiences during test screenings.
*''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'': Not only different endings were intended to use in this film, but nearly a whole different plot, significantly the role of [[Jean Grey]] being more aggressive and disobeying direct orders of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] several times. The alternative endings are: the re-opening of the Xavier Institute in which [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is now a professor; [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] coming back to [[Alberta, Canada]], specifically the very same tavern seen in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''; and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] keeping her powers.
* ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' had two different endings. One had Lady Totington marrying PC Mackintosh and another had Lady Totington visiting Wallace and giving Gromit the golden carrot.
* ''[[Whisper (film)|Whisper]]'': In the alternative ending, the kidnapper Max has chased the demon boy David through the forest David makes him believe the wolves around him are the people who died. When they turn into wolves, they attack Max, but instead of throwing the axe and hitting David, Max holds on to the axe as he falls and the wolves maul him to death. Afterwards, the cops show up and wrap David up in a blanket and take him to safety. As the police van leaves, you can see David smiling.

==Examples in television==
In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.
*''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'': To keep the ending to Season 1 a surprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Teri's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Teri live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over.
*''[[D.I.E]]'': In original ending, Yue Sir ([[Roger Kwok]]) dies from a car accident and the audience wanted a happier ending so TVB created a new one in the style of [[mo lei tau]] comedy. In the new ending, the cast tries to stop the car accident that would kill Yue Sir from happening.
*''[[E.U. (TV series)|E.U.]]'': Due to the popularity of [[Michael Tse]]'s character Laughing Gor, who died in episode 22, an ending was shot where Laughing changes into his police uniform and talks. The ending never implied whether Laughing is alive or not and leaves it open for the audience to decide.
*''[[Green Wing]]'': In the final [[Green Wing Special|Special]], Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made.
*''[[Sex and the City]]'': In the series finale three endings were shot, in which [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'': (1) becomes engaged to [[Aleksandr Petrovsky]], (2) resumes her relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]], and (3) turns down both suitors and reaffirms her love for her friends.
*''[[The Simpsons]]'': In the two part episode "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]" there was an alternative ending where it was revealed that the shooter of Mr. Burns was [[Waylon Smithers]] rather than [[Maggie Simpson]]. Shots of other characters shooting Mr. Burns were also fully animated, though no other complete ending scenes were produced. (These alternative shootings were intended to be intentionally 'leaked' as an elaborate practical joke on the media, but the producers could find no journalists who would take the bait.)
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'': At the end of Season 4, the audience learns that one of the main characters will die in the future. To keep the identity of this person a secret, three different versions of the final scene were shot. The canonical ending shows that Locke will die, while the alternative endings had Sawyer and Desmond die.
*''[[Total Drama]]'': For every season of this animated "reality show", 2 endings were filmed in which both finalists would win the competition. Every country Total Drama aired in got to decide which ending to air.
*''[[King of the Hill]]'': Some episodes have alternative endings (including the episode "The Company Man"), which can be found on the DVD Special Features.
*''[[Psych]]'': the episode "100 Clues", a parody of the board game Clue, had alternate endings where the fans decided  who was the culprit of murdering a guest at a party. Also, the episode "Right Turn or Left for Dead" involves the main character, Shawn, playing out an alternative ending to the episode in his head had events in the previous episode been slightly different.
*''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'': In the episode, "The Lady Killer," three endings were shot, each revealing a member of the A-Team. Because the producers wanted to keep this member a secret from everyone (including the cast members), they shot three endings and did not tell anyone who the member of the A-Team was. Out of Paige's alternate ending, Caleb's ending, and Toby's ending, the producers ended up showing Toby's.
*''[[Secrets and Lies (U.S. TV series)|Secrets and Lies]]'': In order to keep the real killer's identity secret until the end, several multiple endings were shot.

==Examples in video games==
{{Main|Types_of_fiction_with_multiple_endings#Video_games|l1=Video games with multiple endings}}
Many video games also have alternative endings. These endings are generally posed after completing the game in a harder difficulty, or taking a different route through the game's storyline.

==Examples in music==
*English rock band [[Marillion]]'s 1994 [[concept album]] ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'' is one of the very few examples of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music. The vinyl edition of ''Brave'' featured a [[multisided record|double groove]] on side B of the second record, the final side of the album: depending on where the needle was dropped, the record would either play the standard track listing (the songs "The Great Escape" and "Made Again") or would instead play only an alternative version of "The Great Escape" with different lyrics, presenting an alternative, darker ending to the album's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/brave.htm |title=Marillion – 'Brave' |publisher=marillion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
* [[Felix Salten]]’s ''[[The Hound of Florence]]'' differs greatly in the original [[German language]] (''Der Hund von Florenz'') and in the [[English language|English]] translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 | language=German | page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence: A Novel | date=1930 | location=New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | translator=Huntley Paterson | others=Illustrated by Kurt Wiese | pages=230– }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

'''Boutique Week''' is a bi-annual shopping event in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami. Boutique Week was launched in October 2010 in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles with over 40 [[boutiques]] participating in each city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919143430/http://www.boutiqueweek.net/ |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the participating boutiques offers their merchandise at a discount of at least 25% off during the selected week.

==support==
Boutique Week is supported by local government in these cities as an effort to stimulate the economy and raise awareness for small local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view%3Dpage%26pageId%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023054400/http://boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view=page&amp;pageId=3 |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page%3Dhappenings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708081449/http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page=happenings |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boutique Week also raises money for [[Nancy Lublin]]'s non-profit organisation [[Dress For Success (organization)|Dress for Success]], supplying women with [[interview suit]]s and resources they need for success in today's workforce.

==Founders==
Boutique Week was founded in July 2010 by Polina Raygorodskaya and Olga Vidisheva.

Polina Raygorodskaya&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polinafashion.com|title=NYC Fashion PR, Marketing, Fashion Public Relations|website=www.polinafashion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the founder and president of Polina Fashion LLC. Formerly a top [[runway model]], Raygorodskaya earned a [[BS degree]] in [[Business Administration]] at [[Babson College]].  Her entrepreneurial endeavors have been recognized by [[Fox Business Channel]] and [[LegalZoom]]. In 2007, [[Business Week]] named her as one of the "Best 25 Entrepreneurs Under 25".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/oct2007/sb20071019_394343_page_2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalzoom.com/business-management/success-stories/hottest-young-entrepreneurs|title=The Hottest Young Entrepreneurs of 2008|date=1 December 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olga Vidisheva is currently pursuing a [[Masters degree]] in Business Administration at [[Harvard Business School]]. Most recently, she worked for [[Chanel]] in their 'Fashion' and 'Fragrance and Beauté' marketing divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20100914/Harvard+Goes+High+Fashion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918031704/http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20100914/Harvard%2BGoes%2BHigh%2BFashion |archivedate=2010-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Carbon monoxide poisoning''' typically occurs from [[inhalation|breathing]] in [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) at excessive levels.&lt;ref name=Sc2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schottke|first1=David|title=Emergency Medical Responder: Your First Response in Emergency Care|date=2016|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1284107272|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms are often described as "[[flu]]-like" and commonly include [[headache]], [[dizziness]], weakness, vomiting, [[chest pain]], and [[confusion]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; Large exposures can result in [[loss of consciousness]], [[arrhythmias]], [[seizures]], or death.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; The classically described "cherry red skin" rarely occurs.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Long term complications may include feeling tired, trouble with memory, and movement problems.&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; In those [[smoke inhalation|exposed to smoke]], [[cyanide toxicity]] should also be considered.&lt;ref name=Gu2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=JA|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=Critical care clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=537–48|pmid=22998990|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur accidentally or as an [[suicide|attempt to end one's life]].&lt;ref name=Buck2011/&gt; CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating.&lt;ref name=Bl2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleecker|first1=ML|title=Carbon monoxide intoxication|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|date=2015|volume=131|pages=191–203|pmid=26563790|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-62627-1.00024-X|series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|isbn=978-0444626271}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced during [[incomplete combustion|incomplete burning]] of [[organic matter]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This can occur from [[motor vehicles]], heaters, or cooking equipment that run on [[carbon-based fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; It can also occur from exposure to [[methylene chloride]].&lt;ref name=Fer2017/&gt; Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with [[hemoglobin]] to form [[carboxyhemoglobin]] (HbCO) preventing the [[blood]] from carrying [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; Additionally, [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondria]]l [[cytochrome oxidase]] are affected.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Efforts to prevent poisoning include [[carbon monoxide detector]]s, proper venting of [[gas appliances]], keeping chimneys clean, and keeping [[exhaust system]]s of vehicles in good repair.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ&gt;{{cite web|last1=Health|first1=National Center for Environmental|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning – Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en-us|date=30 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705012403/https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm|archivedate=5 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving [[oxygen therapy|100% oxygen]] along with [[supportive care]].&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This should generally be carried out until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; While [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buck2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=NA|last2=Juurlink|first2=DN|last3=Isbister|first3=G|last4=Bennett|first4=MH|last5=Lavonas|first5=EJ|title=Hyperbaric oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=13 April 2011|issue=4|pages=CD002041|pmid=21491385|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002041.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Carbon monoxide poisoning is relatively common, resulting in more than 20,000 [[emergency department]] visits a year in the United States.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penney|first1=David G.|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849384189|page=569|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA569|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA569|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common type of fatal poisoning in many countries.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002&gt;{{cite journal | author=Omaye ST | title=Metabolic modulation of carbon monoxide toxicity | journal=Toxicology |date=Nov 2002 | pages=139–50 | volume=180 | issue=2 | pmid=12324190 | doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00387-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of [[portable generators]] during [[power outage]]s.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2017&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017 E-Book: 5 Books in 1|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0323448383|pages=227–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toxic effects of CO have been known since [[ancient history]].&lt;ref name=Blu2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blumenthal|first1=I|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=June 2001|volume=94|issue=6|pages=270–72|pmid=11387414|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604|pmc=1281520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.&lt;ref name=Blu2001/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Carbon monoxide is not toxic to all forms of life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus has no effect on photosynthesising plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/HC270799/HDL/ENV/enven/vol321.htm|title=Carbon monoxide|work=ernet.in|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414051805/http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/HC270799/HDL/ENV/enven/vol321.htm|archivedate=2014-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is easily absorbed through the lungs.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt; Inhaling the gas can lead to [[Cerebral hypoxia|hypoxic injury]], [[Brain damage|nervous system damage]], and even [[death]].

One of the major concerns following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur.

One classic sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is more often seen in the dead rather than the living – people have been described as looking red-cheeked and healthy (see below). However, since this "cherry-red" appearance is common only in the deceased, and is unusual in living people, it is not considered a useful diagnostic sign in clinical medicine. In pathological (autopsy) examination the ruddy appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning is notable because unembalmed dead persons are normally bluish and pale, whereas dead carbon-monoxide poisoned persons may simply appear unusually lifelike in coloration.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simini B|title=Cherry-red discolouration in carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Lancet| volume=352|issue=9134| page=1154|date=October 1998|pmid=9798630|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)79807-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JEmergMed2002-brooks"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brooks DE, Lin E, Ahktar J |title=What is cherry red, and who cares?|journal= [[The Journal of Emergency Medicine]] |date=February 2002|pages=213–14|volume=22|issue=2|pmid=11858933|doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colorant effect of carbon monoxide in such postmortem circumstances is thus analogous to its use as a red colorant in the commercial meat-packing industry.

== Pathophysiology ==

The precise mechanisms by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]] and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing [[brain]] [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref name="Weaver-NEJM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bateman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bateman DN|title=Carbon Monoxide|journal=Medicine|volume=31|issue=10|page=233|date=October 2003|doi=10.1383/medc.31.10.41.27810}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt;

=== Hemoglobin ===
[[File:Hemoglobin saturation curve.svg|thumb|Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left.]]
Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen, and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is [[heme oxygenase]], which is located in all cells and breaks down [[heme]]. Under normal conditions, carbon monoxide levels in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] are approximately 0 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] because it has a higher diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made.&lt;ref name="Kaplan.Physio"&gt;{{cite book|title=USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes: Physiology|year=2011|author=Dunn, Robert B.|author2=Kudrath, W. |author3=Passo, SS |author4=Wilson, LB|pages=167–68|chapter=7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Townsend CL, Maynard RL |title=Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=59|issue=10|pages=708–11|date=October 2002|pmid=12356933|pmc=1740215|doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.708|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPhysiol1895-Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haldane J|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1895|pages=430–62|volume=18|url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|pmid=16992272|issue=5–6|pmc=1514663|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1895.sp000578|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708152937/http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemoglobin is a [[Tetrameric protein|tetramer]] with four oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon monoxide at one of these sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gorman D, Drewry A, Huang YL, Sames C |title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide|journal=Toxicology|date=May 2003|pages=25–38|volume=187|issue=1|pmid=12679050|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen dissociation curve]] to the left.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.

=== Myoglobin ===

Carbon monoxide also binds to the [[hemeprotein]] [[myoglobin]]. It has a high affinity for myoglobin, about 60 times greater than that of oxygen.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; This causes reduced [[cardiac output]] and [[hypotension]], which may result in [[brain ischemia]].&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt;

=== Cytochrome oxidase ===

Another mechanism involves effects on the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible for effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to [[cytochrome oxidase]] with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gorman DF, Runciman WB |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=506–11 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1750629 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient [[adenosine triphosphate]] synthesis. Cells respond by switching to [[anaerobic metabolism]], causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], [[lactic acidosis]], and eventual cell death.&lt;ref name="PharmacolToxicol2003-alonso"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso JR, Cardellach F, Lopez S, Casademont J, Miro O |title=Carbon monoxide specifically inhibits cytochrome c oxidase of human mitochondrial respiratory chain|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology|date=September 2003|pages=142–46|volume=93|issue=3|pmid=12969439|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0773.2003.930306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of [[oxidative metabolism]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt;

=== Central nervous system effects ===

The mechanism that is thought to have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain [[lipid peroxidation]] (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes [[endothelial]] cell and platelet release of [[nitric oxide]], and the formation of [[oxygen free radicals]] including [[peroxynitrite]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, [[capillary]] leakage, [[leukocyte]] sequestration, and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumenthal I|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=June 2001|pages=270–72|volume=94|issue=6|pmid=11387414|url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11387414|format=Free full text|pmc=1281520|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these effects is [[lipid peroxidation]], which causes delayed reversible [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinization]] of [[white matter]] in the central nervous system known as [[Grinker myelinopathy]], which can lead to [[edema]] and [[necrosis]] within the brain.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt; This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders.

=== Pregnancy ===

Carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women may cause severe adverse [[fetus|fetal]] effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] by decreasing the release of maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the [[placenta]] and combines with [[fetal hemoglobin]], causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt; Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical.&lt;ref name="Greingor"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Greingor JL, Tosi JM, Ruhlmann S, Aussedat M |title=Acute carbon monoxide intoxication during pregnancy. One case report and review of the literature|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|volume=18|issue=5|pages=399–401|date=September 2001|pmid=11559621|pmc=1725677|doi=10.1136/emj.18.5.399|url=http://emj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11559621}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Farrow JR, Davis GJ, Roy TM, McCloud LC, Nichols GR |title=Fetal death due to nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1448–52|date=November 1990|pmid=2262778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

[[File:Breath CO Monitor.jpg|thumb|Breath CO monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample (in ppm) with its corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin.]]
As many symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult.&lt;ref name="Varon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bennetto L, Powter L, Scolding NJ |title=Accidental carbon monoxide poisoning presenting without a history of exposure: A case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|volume=2|issue=1|page=118|date=April 2008|pmid=18430228|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-118|pmc=2390579}}&lt;/ref&gt; A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] compared to the amount of [[hemoglobin]] in the blood.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

The ratio of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin molecules in an average person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%.&lt;ref name="Clinical Toxicology2001-ford"&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Ford MD, Delaney KA, Ling LJ, Erickson T |title=Clinical Toxicology|year=2001|page=1046|publisher=WB Saunders Company|isbn=0721654851}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.&lt;ref&gt;Sato K, Tamaki K, Hattori H, et al.

Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 237–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

As people may continue to experience significant symptoms of CO poisoning long after their blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal, presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level (which may happen in late states of poisoning) does not rule out poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keleş A, Demircan A, Kurtoğlu G |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning: how many patients do we miss?|journal=European Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=15|issue=3|pages=154–57|date=June 2008|pmid=18460956|doi=10.1097/MEJ.0b013e3282efd519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring===
Carbon monoxide may be quantitated in blood using [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] methods or [[chromatography|chromatographic techniques]] in order to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure.

A [[CO-oximeter]] can be used to determine carboxyhemoglobin levels.&lt;ref name="pmid455674"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rodkey FL, Hill TA, Pitts LL, Robertson RF |title=Spectrophotometric measurement of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin in blood|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=25|issue=8|pages=1388–93|date=August 1979|pmid=455674|doi=|url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=455674|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7361284"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rees PJ, Chilvers C, Clark TJ |title=Evaluation of methods used to estimate inhaled dose of carbon monoxide|journal=Thorax|volume=35|issue=1|pages=47–51|date=January 1980|pmid=7361284|pmc=471219|doi= 10.1136/thx.35.1.47|url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7361284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulse [[CO-oximeter]]s estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a [[pulse oximeter]].&lt;ref name="pmid18500075"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Coulange M, Barthelemy A, Hug F, Thierry AL, De Haro L|title=Reliability of new pulse CO-oximeter in victims of carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Undersea &amp; Hyperbaric Medicine|volume=35|issue=2|pages=107–11|date=March 2008|pmid=18500075|doi=|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8084|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625021038/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8084|archivedate=2011-06-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries.&lt;ref name="MaiselEditorial"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Maisel | first = William | authorlink =  |author2=Roger J.

As this is not possible in people who are unresponsive, these devices may not appropriate for use in on-scene emergency care detection of CO poisoning.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

There are many conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref name="Kao"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kao LW, Nañagas KA |title=Toxicity associated with carbon monoxide |journal=Clinics in Laboratory Medicine |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=99–125 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16567227 |doi=10.1016/j.cll.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emedicine"&gt;{{cite web | last =Shochat | first =Guy N | title =Toxicity, Carbon Monoxide | publisher =[[emedicine]] | date =17 February 2009 | url =http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819987-overview | accessdate =2009-04-27 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090309072832/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819987-overview | archivedate =9 March 2009 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest symptoms, especially from low level exposures, are often non-specific and readily confused with other illnesses, typically [[influenza|flu-like viral syndromes]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[chest pain]], and [[migraine]] or other headaches.&lt;ref name="Chest1990-ilano"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ilano AL, Raffin TA | title=Management of carbon monoxide poisoning | journal=Chest | date=Jan 1990 | pages=165–69 | volume=97 | issue=1 | pmid=2403894 | doi=10.1378/chest.97.1.165  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide has been called a "great mimicker" due to the presentation of poisoning being diverse and nonspecific.&lt;ref name="Kao"/&gt; Other conditions included in the differential diagnosis include [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], [[altitude sickness]], [[lactic acidosis]], [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[meningitis]], [[methemoglobinemia]], or [[Opioid overdose|opioid]] or toxic alcohol poisoning.&lt;ref name="emedicine"/&gt;

Prevention remains a vital [[public health]] issue, requiring public education on the safe operation of appliances, heaters, fireplaces, and internal-combustion engines, as well as increased emphasis on the installation of [[carbon monoxide detector]]s.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ernst A, Zibrak JD |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=339|issue=22|pages=1603–08|date=November 1998|pmid=9828249|doi=10.1056/NEJM199811263392206|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=9828249&amp;promo=ONFLNS19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide is tasteless and odourless, and therefore can not be detected by visual cues or smell.&lt;ref name=Millar20008&gt;{{cite journal |title=Compressed breathing air – the potential for evil from within |vauthors=Millar IL, Mouldey PG |year=2008 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=145–51 |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |publisher=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |accessdate=2013-04-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063245/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= |pmid=22692708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] has stated, "carbon monoxide detectors are as important to home safety as smoke detectors are," and recommends each home have at least one carbon monoxide detector, and preferably one on each level of the building.&lt;ref name="cpsc.gov"/&gt; These devices, which are relatively inexpensive&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"/&gt; and widely available, are either battery- or AC-powered, with or without battery backup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipinski|first=Edward R|title=Keeping Watch on Carbon Monoxide|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 14, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100533/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|archivedate=June 23, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In buildings, carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment. If a relatively high level of carbon monoxide is detected, the device sounds an alarm, giving people the chance to evacuate and ventilate the building.&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krenzelok EP, Roth R, Full R |title=Carbon monoxide ... the silent killer with an audible solution |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |date=September 1996 |pages=484–86 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pmid=8765117 |doi=10.1016/S0735-6757(96)90159-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yoon SS, Macdonald SC, Parrish RG |title=Deaths from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning and potential for prevention with carbon monoxide detectors |journal=JAMA |date=March 1998 |pages=685–87 |volume=279 |issue=9 |pmid=9496987 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.9.685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[smoke detector]]s, carbon monoxide detectors do not need to be placed near ceiling level.

The use of carbon monoxide detectors has been standardized in many areas. In the US, NFPA 720-2009,&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=NFPA 720: Standard for the Installation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detection and Warning Equipment|publisher=National Fire Protection Agency|location=Quincy, MA|year=2009|pages=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]], mandates the placement of carbon monoxide detectors/alarms on every level of the residence, including the basement, in addition to outside sleeping areas. In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels.&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt; NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non-residential buildings. These guidelines, which now pertain to schools, healthcare centers, nursing homes and other non-residential buildings, include three main points:&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt;
:1. A secondary power supply (battery backup) must operate all carbon monoxide notification appliances for at least 12 hours,
:2. Detectors must be on the ceiling in the same room as permanently installed fuel-burning appliances, and
:3. Detectors must be located on every habitable level and in every [[HVAC]] zone of the building.

Gas organizations will often recommend to get gas appliances serviced at least once a year.&lt;ref name="Gas Safe Register (UK Government Organization)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gas Safety in the Home |publisher=UK Gas Safe Register |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url=http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502012946/http://gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal requirements ===

The NFPA standard is not necessarily enforced by law. As of April 2006, the US state of Massachusetts requires detectors to be present in all residences with potential CO sources, regardless of building age and whether they are owner-occupied or rented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|title=MGL Ch. 148 §28F{{frac|1|2}} – Nicole's Law, effective March 31, 2006|work=malegislature.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230154311/http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|archivedate=December 30, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enforced by municipal inspectors, and was inspired by the death of 7-year-old Nicole Garofalo in 2005 due to snow blocking a home heating vent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305145343/http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions may have no requirement or only mandate detectors for new construction or at time of sale.

Despite similar deaths in vehicles with clogged exhaust pipes (for example in the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] and [[February 2013 nor'easter]]) and the commercial availability of the equipment, there is no legal requirement for automotive CO detectors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===World Health Organization recommendations===
The following guideline values (ppm values rounded) and periods of time-weighted average exposures have been determined in such a way that the carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level of 2.5% is not exceeded, even when a normal subject engages in light or moderate exercise:
* 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (87 ppm) for 15 min
* 60&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (52 ppm) for 30 min
* 30&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (26 ppm) for 1 h
* 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (9 ppm) for 8 h

For indoor air quality 7&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (6 ppm) for 24 h (so as not to exceed 2% COHb for chronic exposure)

The earliest description of carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; Documented cases of carbon monoxide being used as a [[Suicide methods#Carbon monoxide|method of suicide]] date to at least 100 BC in [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penney|first1=David G.|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849384189|page=754|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910172025/https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|archivedate=2017-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work ''Misopogon'': "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside."&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Misopogon'' 341C-D&lt;/ref&gt; This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]].

[[John Scott Haldane]] identified carbon monoxide as the lethal constituent of [[afterdamp]], the gas created by [[combustion]], after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions. Their skin was coloured cherry-pink from [[carboxyhaemoglobin]], the stable compound formed in the blood by reaction with the gas. As a result of his research, he was able to design respirators for rescue workers. He tested the effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber, describing the results of his slow poisoning. In the late 1890s, he introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either white mice or canaries. With a faster metabolism, they showed the effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for the workers, and so gave an early warning of the problem. The [[canary in a coal mine|canary]] in British pits was replaced in 1986 by the electronic gas detector.

As part of the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], German [[Nazi]]s used [[gas van]]s at [[Chelmno extermination camp]] and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several [[extermination camp|death camps]] such as [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor]] and [[Belzec]]. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in [[action T4]], the programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and [[disabled people]] before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by [[IG Farben]] in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]]. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers of people in the gas vans and the special [[gas chamber]]s used in the [[death camp]]s such as [[Treblinka]]. [[Exhaust fumes]] from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Genocide|vauthors=Totten S, Bartrop P, Markusen E|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|pages=129, 156|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526000146/http://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;ots=S8jhBY6NxB&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|archivedate=2013-05-26|df=|isbn=978-0313346422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of oxygen as treatment began in 1868.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; The use of hyperbaric oxygen in rats following poisoning was studied by Haldane in 1895 while its use in humans began in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt;

==Research==
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the body as a byproduct of converting [[protoporphyrin]] into [[bilirubin]]. This carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

Small amounts of CO are beneficial and enzymes exist that produce it at times of oxidative stress. Drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of CO during certain kinds of surgery, these drugs are called [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foresti|first1=R|last2=Bani-Hani|first2=MG|last3=Motterlini|first3=R|title=Use of carbon monoxide as a therapeutic agent: promises and challenges.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=April 2008|volume=34|issue=4|pages=649–58|pmid=18286265|doi=10.1007/s00134-008-1011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chronology of the Great Famine''' ({{lang-ga|'''An Gorta Mór'''}}&lt;ref&gt;The term has appeared in the titles of numerous books on the event, as demonstrated by [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Gorta+Mo%CC%81r%22&amp;=Search&amp;qt=results_page this search on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''An Drochshaol'', litt: ''The Bad Life'') documents a period  of Irish history between 1845 and 1852&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy (1995), xvi–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity, Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[proximate cause]] was [[famine]] resulting from a potato disease commonly known as [[late blight]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, ''Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives'', Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although blight ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, the impact and human cost in Ireland{{spaced ndash}}where a third of the population was entirely dependent on the potato for food{{spaced ndash}}was exacerbated by a host of political, social and economic factors which remain the subject of historical debate.

An important and controversial point of debate, that is notable amongst Irish people, was that Irish food supplies were sufficient until it was taken away by the British the feed the British, and the landlords kept economic benefits to themselves. Some commentators and writers controversially compared this explanation to "genocide".

== Chronology ==

===1845===

====August====
At the beginning of August, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], the British Prime Minister, received news of a potato disease in the South of England. This was the first recorded evidence that the 'blight' which had ravaged the potato crop in North America in 1843-1844 had crossed the Atlantic. Cecil Woodham-Smith would write that a failure in England would be serious, but for Ireland, it would be a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39&lt;/ref&gt;

====September====
Following earlier reports of incidences of the blight in England, on 13 September 1845 &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}} pg.32 put the date at the 16th&lt;/ref&gt; potato blight was first reported in Ireland. The crops at Dublin were suddenly perishing, it was reported in the ''Gardeners' Chronicle'', asking "where will Ireland be in the event of a universal potato rot?"  The British Government were nevertheless optimistic through the next few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

====October====
[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|[[Skibbereen]] 1847 by [[Cork (city)|Cork]] artist [[James Mahony]] (1810–1879), commissioned by the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]
*As soon as digging of potato crops began, devastating reports started coming in. Sir Robert Peel found the accounts 'very alarming' and writing to Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary on 13 October reminded him that there was always a tendency in Irish news to exaggerate.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.41&lt;/ref&gt; Constabulary Reports from the 15 reported great failures, Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary wrote that the truth about the potato crop, until digging was completed, could not be fully ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.42&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] was prompted to act,&lt;ref&gt;''The Course of Irish History'' (1994) edited by T.W.Moody and F.X.Martin. Page 268. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|1-85635-108-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 October he decided to summon an emergency meeting of his Cabinet for 31 October. The remedy he decided was to repeal the [[Corn Laws]].&lt;ref name="cws-p50"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.50&lt;/ref&gt; Peel then decided to set up a Scientific Commission to go to Ireland and investigate the potato blight and report on conditions.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergency Cabinet meeting met on 31 October till 1 November. The first day consisted of reading reports and memoranda from Ireland on the potato failure. Peel proposed that a relief commission be established in Ireland, and a sum of money be advanced to the Lord -Lieutenant. Differences arose when Peel pointed out that these measures required an advance of public money. The purchase of food for destitute districts would open the question of [[Corn Laws]]. Was it possible, it was asked, to vote public money for the sustenance of a people on account of "actual or apprehended scarcity" and still maintain restrictions on the free import of grain; Peel declared it was not.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.51&lt;/ref&gt; On this issue then the Cabinet split, the overwhelming majority voting against Peel.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to reach a decision, the Cabinet adjourned till 6 November.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;

The principle of the Corn Laws had been to keep the price of home-grown grain up. Duties on imported grain assured English farmers a minimum and profitable price. The burden of a higher price for bread was carried by the labouring classes, in particular factory workers and operatives. It was claimed that if the Corn Laws were repealed all those connected with the land would be ruined and the established social organisation of the country destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

According to Cecil Woodham-Smith, the rising wrath of Tories and landlords ensured "all interest in Ireland was submerged."  She writes that the Tory Mayor of Liverpool refused to call a meeting for the relief of Irish distress. She continues that the [[Mansion House Committee]] in Dublin was accused of 'deluding the public with a false alarm', and the blight itself 'was represented as the invention of agitators on the other side of the water'. The entanglement of the Irish famine with the repeal of the Corn Laws, she says, was a key misfortune for Ireland. The potato failure was eclipsed by the domestic issue of Corn Law repeal. The Irish famine, she writes, "slipped into the background."&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

====November====

*On 9–10 November&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 54&lt;/ref&gt; Peel ordered the secret purchase of £100,000 worth of [[Maize|Indian corn]] and meal from America for distribution in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.49&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 15 November the Scientific Commissioners reported that half the potato crop had been destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;
*On 19 November the Mansion House Committee in Dublin claimed to have "ascertained beyond the shadow of doubt that considerably more than one-third of the entire potato crop...has been already destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.43&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 20 November the Relief Commission first met.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52, Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 57&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unable to persuade his Cabinet to repeal the Corn Laws, on 5 December Peel tendered his resignation &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.37&lt;/ref&gt; to Queen Victoria but was reinstated days later when [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] was unable to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===1846===
The first deaths from hunger took place in early 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keneally (1999) ''The Great Shame''. London: Vintage: 110&lt;/ref&gt; In March Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland but was forced to resign as Prime Minister on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 78–86&lt;/ref&gt; The new Whig administration under [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], influenced by their [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 408–11&lt;/ref&gt; then halted government food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without any work, money or food.&lt;ref name="david2002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 224, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Grain continued to be exported from the country.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; Private initiatives such as The Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends (Quakers) attempted to fill the gap caused by the end of government relief and eventually the government reinstated the relief works, although bureaucracy slowed the release of food supplies.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; The blight almost totally destroyed the 1846 crop and the Famine worsened considerably.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; By December a third of a million destitute people were employed in public works.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 311&lt;/ref&gt;

===1847===
[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Leave Ireland'', engraving by Henry Doyle (1827–1892), from Mary Frances Cusack's Illustrated History of Ireland, 1868]]
There were average crop yields in the 1847 harvest, but due to lack of seed potatoes to plant, the crop was low.&lt;ref&gt;Líam Kennedy, Paul S. Ell, E. M. Crawford &amp; L. A. Clarkson, Mapping The Great Irish Famine, Four Courts Press, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85182-353-0}} pg.69&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds began to throng the public works during the last months of 1846 and the start of 1847, which promoted exactly the social conditions for the spread of 'famine fever.'&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.173&lt;/ref&gt; In late January and February, legislation called the Temporary Relief Act went through the British parliament; it became popularly known as the Soup Kitchen Act and occasionally as Burgoyne's Act.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 136&lt;/ref&gt; This system of relief was designed to deliver cheap food directly and gratuitously to the destitute masses. This system of relief would be terminated in September.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg. 81–85&lt;/ref&gt; The government also announced an additional change in the system of relief. After August 1847, the permanent Poor Law was to be extended and was to become responsible for providing relief and as a result, all relief would be financed by the local Poor Law rates.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; This put impossible loads on local poor rates, particularly in the rural west and south.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 174–187&lt;/ref&gt; With the mass emigration of the famine era, the horrors of the '[[coffin ships]]' and 1847 have ever since been associated in the popular mind, according to James S. Donnelly.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.179&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1847 The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847]] was enacted due to growing Irish nationalist agitation that was causing the British government concern about a possible [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|violent rebellion]] against British rule in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, Cecil [[The Great Hunger]] Ireland1845 1849 Harper and Row   New york pages 326-327&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill gave the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] the power to organise the island into districts and bring police forces into them at the districts' expense. It limited who could own guns, and required all of the men in the district between the ages of 16 and 60 to assist in apprehending suspected murderers when landlords were killed, or else be guilty of a misdemeanour themselves.

===1848===
The blight returned in 1848 and outbreaks of cholera were reported.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Evictions became common among the Irish who could not keep up with the demands of their British landlords. Famine victims on outdoor relief peaked in July at almost 840,000 people.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; On 29 July [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|an uprising against the government]] was led by [[William Smith O'Brien]]. After a skirmish at "[[Famine Warhouse 1848|Widow McCormack's house]]" in the village of [[Ballingarry, South Tipperary|Ballingarry]], [[County Tipperary]] the leaders of the rebellion fled to America or were sentenced to transportation.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kee (2000) ''The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism'': 270-89&lt;/ref&gt;

===1849===
The potato crop failed again in 1849 and famine was accompanied by cholera outbreaks.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; This deadly cholera epidemic killed one of Ireland's greatest poets: [[James Clarence Mangan]].&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;

===1850===
The Famine ended.&lt;ref name="david20022002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 313&lt;/ref&gt;

===1851===
By 1851 census figures showed that the population of Ireland had fallen to 6,575,000 – a drop of 1,600,000 in ten years.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Cormac Ó Gráda and Joel Mokyr have described the 1851 census as a famous but flawed source. They contend that the combination of institutional and individuals figures gives "an incomplete and biased count" of fatalities during the famine.&lt;ref name="cormac2006"&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland’s Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, University College Dublin Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The famine left in its wake up to a million dead and another million emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 226&lt;/ref&gt; The famine caused a sense of lasting bitterness by the Irish towards the British government, whom many blamed — then and now — for the starvation of so many people.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; The fall-out of the famine continued for decades afterwards.

The '''chronology of the universe''' describes the history and [[future of the universe]] according to [[Big Bang]] cosmology. The earliest stages of the universe's existence are estimated as taking place 13.8 [[billion years]] ago, with an [[confidence level|uncertainty]] of around 21 million years at the 68% confidence level.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;
The [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck Collaboration]] in 2015 published the estimate of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago (68% confidence interval). See Table 4 on page 31 of pdf. {{Cite journal

==Outline== 
For the purposes of this summary, it is convenient to divide the chronology of the universe since it [[Cosmogony|originated]], into five parts. It is generally considered meaningless or unclear whether [[time]] existed before this chronology:&lt;!--merely based on the de facto article toc, not binding in any way and can be rearranged along with article structure--&gt;

:'''1. The [[#Very early universe|very early universe]]''' – the first [[picosecond]]&amp;nbsp;(10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of cosmic time. It includes the [[Planck epoch]], during which currently understood [[laws of physics]] may not apply; the emergence in stages of the four known [[fundamental interaction]]s or [[force]]s – first [[gravity]], and later the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] interactions; and the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] and [[supercooling]] of the  still immensely hot universe due to [[cosmic inflation]], which is believed to have been triggered by the separation of the [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]].

:Tiny ripples in the universe at this stage are believed to be the basis of large-scale structures that formed much later. Different stages of the very early universe are understood to different extents.  The earlier parts are beyond the grasp of practical experiments in [[particle physics]] but can be explored through other means.

:'''2. The [[#Early universe|early universe]]''', lasting around 377,000 years. Initially, various kinds of [[subatomic particle]]s are formed in stages. These particles include almost equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], so most of it quickly annihilates, leaving a small excess of matter in the universe.

:At about one second,  [[Neutrino decoupling|neutrinos decouple]]; these neutrinos form the [[cosmic neutrino background]]. If [[primordial black hole]]s exist, they are also  formed at about one second of cosmic time.  [[Composite particle|Composite]] [[subatomic particle]]s emerge – including [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s – and from about 3 minutes, conditions are suitable for [[nucleosynthesis]]: around 25% of the protons and all the neutrons  [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[big bang nucleosynthesis|into heavier elements]], mainly [[helium-4]].

:By 20 minutes, the universe is no longer hot enough for fusion, but far too hot for neutral [[atom]]s to exist or [[photon]]s to travel far. It is therefore an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. At around 47,000 years,&lt;ref name="ryden"&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33, 6.41&lt;/ref&gt; as the universe cools, its behavior begins to be dominated by [[matter]] rather than radiation.

:At about 377,000 years {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the universe finally becomes cool enough for neutral [[atom]]s to form ("[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]"), and as a result it also became [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] for the first time. The newly formed atoms – mainly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] with traces of [[lithium]] – quickly reach their lowest energy state ([[ground state]]) by releasing photons ("[[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]"), and these photons can still be detected today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). This is currently the oldest observation we have of the universe.

:'''3. Dark Ages and large-scale [[structure formation|structure emergence]]''', from 377,000 years until about 1 billion years. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent but the clouds of [[hydrogen]] only collapsed very slowly to form [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], so there were no new sources of light. The only photons (electromagnetic radiation, or "light") in the universe were those released during decoupling (visible today as the [[cosmic microwave background]]) and [[hydrogen line|21 cm radio emissions]] occasionally emitted by hydrogen atoms. The decoupled photons would have filled the universe with a brilliant pale orange glow at first, gradually [[redshift]]ing to non-visible [[wavelength]]s after about 3 million years, leaving it without visible light. This period is known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]].

:Between about 10 and 17 million years the universe's average temperature was suitable for liquid water (273 – 373K) and there has been speculation whether rocky planets or indeed life could have arisen briefly, since statistically a tiny part of the universe could have had different conditions from the rest, and gained warmth from the universe as a whole.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October" /&gt;

:At some point around 400 to 700 million years, the earliest generations of [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies form]], and early large structures gradually emerge, drawn to the foam-like  [[dark matter]] [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] which have already begun to draw together throughout the universe. [[Population III star|The earliest generations of stars]] have not yet been observed astronomically. They may have been huge and [[metallicity|non-metallic]] with very short lifetimes compared to [[Main Sequence|most stars we see today]], so they commonly finish burning their [[hydrogen]] fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years. Other theories suggest that they may have included small stars, some perhaps still burning today. In either case, these early generations of supernovae created most of the everyday [[chemical element|elements]] we see around us today, and seeded the universe with them.

:[[Galaxy cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s emerge over time. At some point, high energy photons from the earliest stars, [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and perhaps [[quasar]]s led to a period of [[reionization]]. The universe gradually transitioned into the universe we see around us today, and the Dark Ages only fully came to an end at about 1 billion years.

:'''4. The universe as it appears today'''. From 1 billion years, and for about 12.8 billions of years, the universe has looked much as it does today. It will continue to appear very similar for many billions of years into the future. The [[thin disk]] of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] began to form at about 5 billion years (8.8 bn years ago),&lt;ref name=Peloso&gt;{{cite journal |last1=del Peloso |first1=E. F. |last2=da Silva |first2=L. |last3=Porto de Mello |first3=G. F. |last4=Arany-Prado |first4=L. I. |title=The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eunucleocosmochronology. III. Extended sample  |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |date=2005 |volume=440 |issue=3 |pages=1153–1159 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053307 |bibcode= 2005A&amp;A...440.1153D | arxiv=astro-ph/0506458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|solar system]] formed at about 9.2 billion years (4.6 bn years ago), with the earliest traces of [[timeline of the evolutionary history of life|life]] on Earth emerging by about 10.3 billion years (3.5 bn years ago).

:From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the slowing expansion of space gradually begins to accelerate under the influence of [[dark energy]], which may be a [[scalar field]] throughout our universe. The present-day universe is understood quite well, but beyond about 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years in the future), uncertainties in current knowledge mean that we are less sure which path our universe will take.

:'''5. [[Fate of the universe|The far future]]'''. At some time the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end as stars are no longer being born, and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies. There are various scenarios for the far future and [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. More exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood.

Earliest stages of chronology shown below (before neutrino decoupling) are an active area of research and based on ideas which are still speculative and subject to modification as scientific knowledge improves.

"Time" column is based on extrapolation of observed [[metric expansion of space]] back in the past. For the earliest stages of chronology this extrapolation may be invalid. To give one example, [[eternal inflation]] theories propose that inflation lasts forever throughout most of the universe, making the notion of "N seconds since Big Bang" ill-defined.

The radiation temperature refers to the [[cosmic background radiation]] and is given by 2.725·(1+''z''), where ''z'' is the [[redshift]].

===Planck epoch===
:''Times shorter than 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ([[Planck time]])''
{{Main|Planck epoch}}

The [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] is an era in traditional (non-inflationary) [[Big Bang|Big Bang cosmology]] immediately after the event which began our known universe. During this epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so inconceivably high compared to any temperature we can observe today, that everyday subatomic particles could not form, and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe—[[electromagnetism]], [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction|weak nuclear interaction]], and [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]]—were combined and formed one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a [[gravitational singularity]] before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of [[general relativity]], which is thought to break down for this epoch due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].

In inflationary models of cosmology, times before the end of inflation (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang) do not follow the same timeline as in traditional big bang cosmology. Models that aim to describe the universe and physics during the Planck epoch are generally speculative and fall under the umbrella of "[[New Physics]]".

===Grand unification epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ryden B: "Introduction to Cosmology", p. 196 Addison-Wesley 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Grand unification epoch}}

As the universe [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] and cooled, it crossed transition temperatures at which forces separated from each other. These [[phase transition]]s can be visualised as similar to [[condensation]] and [[freezing]] phase transitions of ordinary matter. At certain temperatures/energies, water molecules change their behaviour and structure, and they will behave completely differently. Like steam turning to water, the [[field (physics)|fields]] which define our universe's fundamental forces and particles also completely change their behaviors and structures when the temperature/energy falls below a certain point. This is not apparent in everyday life, because it only happens at much, much, higher temperatures than we usually see in our present universe.

These phase transitions are believed to be caused by a phenomenon of [[quantum field]]s called "[[symmetry breaking]]".

In everyday terms, as the universe cools, it becomes possible for the quantum fields that create the forces and particles around us, to settle at lower energy levels and with higher levels of stability. In doing so, they completely shift how they interact. Forces and interactions arise due to these fields, so the universe can behave very differently above and below a phase transition. For example, in a later epoch, a side effect of one phase transition is that suddenly, many particles that had no mass at all acquire a mass (they begin to interact with the [[Higgs boson]]), and a single  force begins to manifest as two separate forces.

The grand unification epoch began with a phase transitions of this kind, when gravitation separated from the universal combined [[gauge theory|gauge force]]. This caused two forces to now exist: gravity, and an  [[electrostrong interaction]]. There is no hard evidence yet, that such a combined force existed, but many physicists believe it did. The physics of this electrostrong interaction would be described by a so-called [[grand unified theory]] (GUT).

The grand unification epoch ended with a second phase transition, as the electrostrong interaction in turn separated, and began to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong force|strong]] and [[electroweak force|electroweak]] interactions.

===Electroweak epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds (or the end of inflation) and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
{{Main|Electroweak epoch}}

Depending on how epochs are defined, and the model being followed, the [[electroweak epoch]] may be considered to start before or after the inflationary epoch. In some models it is described as including the inflationary epoch. In other models, the electroweak epoch is said to begin after the inflationary epoch ended, at roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

According to traditional big bang cosmology, the electroweak epoch began 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, when the temperature of the universe was low enough (10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; K) for the [[Grand Unified Theory|Electronuclear Force]] to begin to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong interaction|strong]] and the [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] interactions. (The electroweak interaction will also separate later, dividing into the [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions). The exact point where electrostrong symmetry was broken is not certain, because of the very high energies of this event.

===Inflationary epoch and the rapid expansion of space===
:''Before ca.  10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Inflationary epoch|Expansion of space}}
At this point, the very early universe [[expansion of space|suddenly and very rapidly expanded]] to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; times its previous volume (and possibly much more). This is equivalent to a linear increase of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; times in every spatial dimension – equivalent to an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length, expanding to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long in a tiny fraction of a second. This change is known as [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].

Although light and objects within [[spacetime]] cannot travel faster than the [[speed of light]], in this case it was the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] governing the size and geometry of [[spacetime]] itself that changed in scale. Changes to the metric are not limited by the speed of light.

In some models, it is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition|separation]] of the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]]s which ended the [[grand unification epoch]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated an enormous repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space itself. Inflation explains several observed properties of the current universe that are otherwise difficult to account for, including explaining how today's universe has ended up so exceedingly [[homogeneous]] (similar) on a very large scale, even though it was highly disordered in its earliest stages.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang.  The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflation field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, as the inflaton field decayed into other particles, known as "reheating". This heating effect led to the universe being repopulated with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]]. In other models, reheating is often considered to mark the start of the [[electroweak epoch]], and some  theories, such as [[warm inflation]], avoid a reheating phase entirely.

In non-traditional versions of Big Bang theory  (known as "inflationary" models), inflation ended at a temperature corresponding to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang, but this does ''not'' imply that the inflationary era lasted less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. To explain the observed homogeneity of the universe, the duration in these models must be longer than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. Therefore, in inflationary cosmology, the earliest meaningful time "after the Big Bang" is the time of the ''end'' of inflation. 

After inflation ended, the universe continued to expand, but at a very slow rate. The slow expansion began to speed up after several billion years, believed to be due to [[dark energy]], and is still expanding today.

On March 17, 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]] which was interpreted as clear experimental evidence for the [[Inflation (cosmology)|theory of inflation]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317B"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140324"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=March 24, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865|work=BICEP2 News|title=Not Even Wrong|date=13 May 2014|first=Peter|last=Woit|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported &lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ade, P.

===Electroweak symmetry breaking ===
:''10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Electroweak symmetry breaking}}

As the universe's temperature continued to fall below a certain very high energy level, a third [[symmetry breaking]] occurs. So far as we currently know, it was the final symmetry breaking event in the formation of our universe. It is believed that below some energies unknown yet&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Electroweak interaction ]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak epoch]]. THANK YOU. --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the [[vacuum expectation value]] &lt;math&gt;v = (G_F \sqrt{2})^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Higgs field]] (where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]), it's not the symmetry breaking energy scale.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2018}} the [[Higgs field]] spontaneously acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]]. When this happens, it [[electroweak symmetry breaking|breaks electroweak gauge symmetry]]. This has two related effects:

# Via the [[Higgs mechanism]], all [[elementary particle]]s interacting with the Higgs field become massive, having been massless at higher energy levels.
# As a side-effect, the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetic force]], and their respective [[boson]]s (the [[W and Z bosons]] and [[photon]]) now begin to manifest differently in the present universe. Before electroweak symmetry breaking these bosons were all massless particles and interacted over long distances, but at this point the W and Z bosons abruptly become massive particles only interacting over distances smaller than the size of an atom, while the photon remains massless and remains a long-distance interaction.

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the [[fundamental interactions]] we know of – [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] – have all taken their present forms, and fundamental particles have mass, but the temperature of the universe is still too high to allow the formation of many fundamental particles we now see in the universe.

===Supersymmetry breaking (speculative)===
{{Main|Supersymmetry breaking}}

If [[supersymmetry]] is a property of our universe, then it must be broken at an energy that is no lower than 1 [[TeV]], the electroweak scale. The masses of particles and their [[superpartner]]s would then no longer be equal.  This very high energy could explain why no superpartners of known particles have ever been observed.

==Early universe{{anchor|Early universe}}==

After cosmic inflation ends, the universe is filled with a hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], the remains of reheating. From this point onwards the physics of the early universe is much better understood, and the energies involved in the [[Quark epoch]] are directly amenable to [[particle physics|experiment]].

===The quark epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Quark epoch}}

The [[quark epoch]] began approximately [[Picosecond|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] after the [[Big Bang]]. This was the period in the evolution of the early universe immediately after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], when the [[fundamental interaction]]s of [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow [[quark]]s to bind together to form [[hadron]]s.

During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], containing quarks, [[lepton]]s and their [[antiparticle]]s. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s.

The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the [[binding energy]] of hadrons.

====Baryogenesis====
{{Main|Baryogenesis}}
{{further|Leptogenesis (physics)}}
''Perhaps by 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.''{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baryon]]s are [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, that are composed of three [[quark]]s. It would be expected that both baryons, and particles known as [[antimatter|antibaryons]] would have formed in equal numbers. However, this does not seem to be what happened – as far as we know, the universe was left with far more baryons than antibaryons. In fact, almost no antibaryons are observed in nature. It is not clear how this came about. Any explanation for this phenomenon must allow the [[Sakharov conditions]] related to baryogenesis to have been satisfied at some time after the end of [[cosmological inflation]]. Current [[particle physics]] suggests asymmetries under which these conditions would be met, but these asymmetries appear to be too small to account for the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.

===Hadron epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; second and 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Hadron epoch}}

The quark–gluon plasma that composes the universe cools until [[hadron]]s, including baryons such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, can form.
Initially, hadron/anti-hadron pairs could form, so [[matter]] and [[anti-matter]] were in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, new hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced, and most of the newly formed hadrons and anti-hadrons [[annihilation|annihilated]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high-energy [[photon]]s. A comparatively small residue of hadrons remained at about 1 second of cosmic time, when this epoch ended. 

Theory predicts that about 1 neutron remained for every 7 protons. We believe this to be correct because, at a later stage, all the neutrons and some of the protons [[nuclear fusion|fused]], leaving [[hydrogen]], a hydrogen [[isotope]] called [[deuterium]], [[helium]] and other elements, which we can measure. A 1:7 ratio of hadrons at the end of this epoch would indeed produce the observed element ratios in the early as well as current universe.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Neutrino decoupling and cosmic neutrino background===
:''Around 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{main|Neutrino decoupling|Cosmic neutrino background}}

At approximately 1 second after the Big Bang [[neutrino]]s [[neutrino decoupling|decouple]] and begin traveling freely through space. As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later [[cosmic microwave background]] emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] – ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: {{cite journal |last1=Follin |first1=Brent |last2=Knox |first2=Lloyd |last3=Millea |first3=Marius |last4=Pan |first4=Zhen |title=First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=26 August 2015 |volume=115 |issue=9 |pages=091301 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301|pmid=26371637 |arxiv=1503.07863 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115i1301F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so this [[cosmic neutrino background]] (CNB) may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryon acoustic oscillations|baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover, the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

=== Possible formation of primordial black holes===
: ''May have occurred within about 1 second after the Big Bang''
[[Primordial black hole]]s are a hypothetical type of [[black hole]] proposed in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zel'dovitch &amp; Novikov|title=The Hypothesis of Cores Retarded During Expansion and the Hot Cosmological Model|journal=Astronomicheskii Zhurnal|date=14 March 1966|volume=10|issue=4|pages=602–603|bibcode=1966AZh....43..758Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may have formed during the so-called ''radiation dominated era'', due to the high densities and inhomogeneous conditions within the first second of cosmic time. Random fluctuations could lead to some regions becoming dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes. Current understandings and theories place tight limits on the abundance and mass of these objects.

Typically, primordial black hole formation requires density contrasts (regional variations in the Universe's density) of around &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho / \rho \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;(10%), where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harada |first=T. |last2=Yoo |first2=C.-M. |last3=Khori |first3=K. |year=2013 |title=Threshold of primordial black hole formation |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=084051 |arxiv=1309.4201 |bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88h4051H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.084051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mechanisms could produce dense regions meeting this criterion during the early universe, including reheating, cosmological phase transitions and (in so-called "hybrid inflation models") axion inflation. Since primordial black holes didn't form from stellar [[gravitational collapse]], their masses can be far below stellar mass (~2×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g). [[Stephen Hawking]] calculated in 1971 that primordial black holes could weigh as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} But they can have any size, so they could also be large, and may have contributed to the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]].

===Lepton epoch===
:''Between 1 second and 10 seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Lepton epoch}}

The majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate each other at the end of the hadron epoch, leaving [[lepton]]s (such as the [[electron]], [[muon]]s and certain [[neutrino]]s) and anti-leptons, dominating the mass of the universe. 

The lepton epoch follows a similar path to the earlier hadron epoch. Initially leptons and anti-leptons are produced in pairs. About 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe falls to the point at which new lepton/anti-lepton pairs are no longer created and most remaining leptons and anti-leptons quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high energy photons, and leaving a small residue of non-annihilated leptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|title=The Timescale of Creation|website=Knowledge tree project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728123714/http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|archivedate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon epoch===
:''Between 10 seconds and 377,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Photon epoch}}

After most leptons and anti-leptons are annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, most of the mass-energy in the universe is left in the form of [[photon]]s. (Much of the rest of its mass-energy is in the form of [[neutrino]]s and other [[special relativity|relativistic]] particles{{cn|date=September 2018}}). Therefore the energy of the universe, and its overall behavior, is dominated by its [[photon]]s. These photons continue to interact frequently with charged protons, electrons and (eventually) [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. They continue to do so for about the next 377,000 years.

===Nucleosynthesis of light elements===
:''Between 2 minutes and 20 minutes after the Big Bang''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html|title=Detailed timeline of Big Bang nucleosynthesis processes|first=Edward L.|last=Wright|date=26 September 2012|website=astro.ucla.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}

Between about 2 and 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and pressure of the universe allow [[nuclear fusion]] to occur, giving rise to nuclei of a few light [[chemical element|elements]] beyond hydrogen ("[[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]"). About 25% of the protons, and all&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; the neutrons fuse to form [[deuterium]], a hydrogen [[isotope]], and most of the deuterium quickly fuses to form [[helium-4]]. 

Atomic nuclei will easily unbind (break apart) above a certain temperature, related to their [[binding energy]]. From about 2 minutes, the falling temperature means that deuterium no longer unbinds, and is stable,  and starting from about 3 minutes, helium and other elements formed by the fusion of deuterium  also no longer unbind and are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_10/notes44.html|first=Barbara|last=Ryden|date=12 March 2003|title=Astronomy 162 — Lecture 44: The first three minutes|website=astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short duration and falling temperature means that only the simplest and fastest fusion processes can occur.

The amounts of each light element in the early universe can be estimated from old galaxies, and is strong evidence for the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; For example, the Big Bang should produce about 1 neutron for every 7 protons, allowing for 25% of all nucleons to be fused into helium-4 (2 protons and 2 neutrons out of every 16 nucleons), and this is the amount we find today, and far more than can be easily explained by other processes.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Similarly, deuterium fuses extremely easily; any alternative explanation must also explain how conditions existed for deuterium to form, but also left some of that deuterium unfused and not immediately fused again into helium.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Any alternative must also explain the proportions of the various light elements and their isotopes. A few isotopes, such as lithium-7, were found to be present in amounts that differed from theory, but over time, these differences have been resolved by better observations.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Matter domination===
:''47,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{main|Matter-dominated era}}
Until now, the universe's large scale dynamics and behavior have been determined mainly by radiation – meaning, those constituents that move [[special relativity|relativistically]] (at or near the [[speed of light]]), such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; As the universe cools, from around 47,000 years (z=3600),&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large scale behavior becomes dominated by [[matter]] instead. This occurs because the energy density of matter begins to exceed both the energy density of radiation  and the vacuum energy density.&lt;ref&gt;Zelik, M and Gregory, S: "Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", page 497. Thompson Learning, Inc. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Around or shortly after this time,{{when|date=April 2018}} the densities of non-relativistic matter (atomic nuclei) and relativistic radiation (photons) become equal, the [[Jeans length]], which determines the smallest structures that can form (due to competition between gravitational attraction and pressure effects), begins to fall and perturbations, instead of being wiped out by [[free-streaming]] [[radiation]], can begin to grow in amplitude.

According to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], by this stage, the [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. (However the total matter in the universe is only 31.7%, much smaller than the 68.3% of [[dark energy]]). There is overwhelming evidence that [[dark matter]] exists and dominates our universe, but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood, Big Bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation.

From this point on, and for several billion years to come, the presence of dark matter accelerates the [[structure formation|formation of structure]] in our universe. In the early universe, dark matter gradually gathers in huge filaments under the effects of [[gravity]]. This amplifies the tiny inhomogeneities (irregularities) in the density of the universe which was left by cosmic inflation. Over time, slightly denser regions become denser and slightly rarefied (emptier) regions become more rarefied. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter.

About 377,000 years after the Big Bang, two connected events occurred: [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Recombination describes the ionized particles combining to form the first  neutral [[atom]]s, and decoupling refers to the [[photon]]s released ("decoupled") as the newly formed atoms settle into more stable energy states.

Just before recombination, the [[baryonic matter]] in the universe was at a temperature where it formed a hot [[plasma (physics)|ionized plasma]]. Most of the photons in the universe interacted with electrons and protons, and could not travel significant distances without interacting with ionized particles. As a result, the universe was opaque or "foggy". Although there was light, it was not possible to see, nor can we observe that light through telescopes.

At around 377,000 years, the universe has cooled to a point where free [[electron]]s can combine with the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to form neutral atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results | first=G. | last=Hinshaw | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume=180 | issue=2| pages=225–245 | year=2009 | url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/pub_papers/fiveyear/basic_results/wmap5basic.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 | arxiv=0803.0732 | bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is relatively fast (and faster for the helium than for the hydrogen), and is known as [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V: "Physical foundations of Cosmology", p. 120, Cambridge 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The name is slightly inaccurate and is given for historical reasons: in fact the electrons and atomic nuclei were combining for the first time.

Directly combining in a low energy state ([[ground state]]) is less efficient, so these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons still in a high energy state, and once combined, the electrons quickly release energy in the form of one or more [[photon]]s as they transition to a low energy state. This release of photons is known as [[Decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Some of these decoupled photons are captured by other hydrogen atoms, the remainder remain free. By the end of recombination, most of the protons in the universe have formed neutral atoms. This change from charged to neutral particles means that the [[mean free path]] photons can travel before capture in effect becomes infinite, so any decoupled photons that have not been captured can travel freely over long distances (see [[Thomson scattering]]). The universe has become transparent to visible [[light]], [[radio wave]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] for the first time in its history.

|}
The photons released by these newly formed hydrogen atoms initially had a [[Color temperature|temperature/energy of around ~ 4000&amp;nbsp;K]]. This would have been visible to the eye as a pale yellow/orange tinted, or "soft", white color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediacollege.com/lighting/colour/colour-temperature.html|title=Color temperature chart|website=Media college|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over billions of years since decoupling, as the universe has expanded, the photons have been [[red-shift]]ed from visible light to radio waves (microwave radiation corresponding to a temperature of about 2.7&amp;nbsp;K). Red shifting describes the photons acquiring longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency|frequencies]] as the [[metric expansion of space|universe expanded over billions of years]], so that they gradually changed from visible light to radio waves. These same photons can still be detected as radio waves today. They form the [[cosmic microwave background]] ("CMB"), and they provide crucial evidence of the early universe and how it developed.

Around the same time as recombination, existing [[pressure wave]]s within the electron-baryon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] – known as [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] – became embedded in the distribution of matter as it condensed, giving rise to a very slight preference in distribution of large-scale objects. Therefore, the cosmic microwave background is a picture of the universe at the end of this epoch including the tiny fluctuations generated during [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] (see diagram), and the spread of objects such as galaxies in the universe is an indication of the scale and size of the universe as it developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Quasars illustrate dark energy's roller coaster ride|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20303592|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark Ages ===
&lt;!--Note: This section is directly linked to by [[Graphical timeline from Big Bang to Heat Death]]. Update that link if changing the anchor in the section title.--&gt;
{{see also|21 centimeter radiation}}
After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent and had cooled enough to allow light to travel long distances, but there were no light-producing structures such as [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Stars and galaxies are formed when dense regions of gas form due to the action of [[gravity]], and this takes a long time within a near-uniform density of gas and on the scale required, so it is estimated that stars did not exist for perhaps hundreds of millions of years after recombination.

This period, known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]], began around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. During the Dark Ages, the temperature of the universe cooled from some 4000&amp;nbsp;K down to about 60&amp;nbsp;K, and only two sources of photons existed: the photons released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral hydrogen atoms formed), which we can still detect today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), and photons occasionally released by neutral hydrogen atoms, known as the [[hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line of neutral hydrogen]]. The hydrogen spin line is in the microwave range of frequencies, and within 3 million years,{{cn|date=October 2018}} the CMB photons had [[redshift]]ed out of visible light to [[infrared]]; from that time until the first stars, there were no visible light photons. Other than perhaps some rare statistical anomalies, the universe was truly dark.

The October 2010 discovery of [[UDFy-38135539]], the first observed galaxy to have existed during the following [[reionization]] epoch, gives us a window into these times. The galaxy earliest in this period observed and thus also the most distant galaxy ever observed is currently on the record of Leiden University's Richard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingsworth from UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. They found the galaxy [[UDFj-39546284]] to be at a time some 480 million years after the Big Bang or about halfway through the Cosmic Dark Ages at a distance of about 13.2 billion [[light-years]]. More recently, the [[UDFy-38135539]], [[EGSY8p7]] and [[GN-z11]] galaxies were found to be around 380–550 million years after the Big Bang and at a distance of around 13.4 billion light-years.&lt;ref name="Space-20121212"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Ancient Galaxy May Be Most Distant Ever Seen|url=http://www.space.com/18879-hubble-most-distant-galaxy.html |date=December 12, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also currently an [[LOFAR|observational effort]] underway to detect the faint 21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line radiation, as it is in principle an even more powerful tool than the cosmic microwave background for studying the early universe.

Structures may have begun to emerge from around 150 million years, and stars and early galaxies gradually emerged from around 400 to 700 million years. As they emerged, the Dark Ages gradually ended. Because this process was gradual, the Dark Ages only fully ended around 1 billion (1000 million) years, as the universe took its present appearance.

====Speculative "habitable epoch"====
:''ca. 10–17 million years after the Big Bang''

For about 6.6 million years, between about 10 to 17 million years after the Big Bang (redshift 137–100), the background temperature was between 373&amp;nbsp;K and 273&amp;nbsp;K, a temperature compatible with [[liquid water]] and common [[biological]] [[chemical reactions]]. [[Avi Loeb|Loeb]] (2014) speculated that [[Abiogenesis|primitive life]] might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|arxiv = 1312.0613 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20131202"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |arxiv=1312.0613 |date=December 2013|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L |doi = 10.1017/S1473550414000196 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb argues that carbon-based life might have evolved in a hypothetical pocket of the early universe that was dense enough both to generate at least one massive star that subsequently releases carbon in a supernova, and that was also dense enough to generate a planet. (Such dense pockets, if they existed, would have been extremely rare.) Life would also have required a heat differential, rather than just uniform background radiation; this could be provided by naturally-occurring geothermal energy. Such life would likely have remained primitive; it is highly unlikely that intelligent life would have had sufficient time to evolve before the hypothetical oceans freeze over at the end of the habitable epoch.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |title=Life possible in the early Universe |url=https://www.nature.com/news/life-possible-in-the-early-universe-1.14341 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |work=Nature |date=10 December 2013 |pages=201–201 |language=en |doi=10.1038/504201a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest structures and stars emerge===

[[File:Hubble - infant galaxy.jpg|thumb|245px|Another Hubble image shows an infant galaxy forming nearby, which means this happened very recently on the cosmological timescale. This shows that new galaxy formation in the universe is still occurring.]]

The [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. Since the start of the matter-dominated era, the dark matter has gradually been gathering in huge spread out (diffuse) [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] under the effects of [[gravity]]. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter. It is also slightly more dense at regular distances due to early [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) which became embedded into the distribution of matter when photons decoupled. Unlike dark matter, ordinary matter can lose energy by many routes, which means that as it collapses, it can lose the energy which would otherwise hold it apart, and collapse more quickly, and into denser forms. Ordinary matter gathers where dark matter is denser, and in those places it collapses into clouds of mainly hydrogen [[gas cloud|gas]]. The first stars and galaxies form from these clouds. Where numerous galaxies have formed, galaxy clusters and superclusters will eventually arise. Large [[void (cosmology)|voids]] with few stars will develop between them, marking where dark matter became less common.

Structure formation in the big bang model proceeds hierarchically, due to [[gravitational collapse]], with smaller structures forming before larger ones. The earliest structures to form are the first stars (known as [[population III stars]]), [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]], and [[quasar]]s (which are thought to be bright, early [[active galaxies]] containing a [[supermassive black hole]] surrounded by a inward-spiralling [[accretion disk]] of gas). Before this epoch, the evolution of the universe could be understood through linear cosmological [[perturbation theory]]: that is, all structures could be understood as small deviations from a perfect homogeneous universe. This is computationally relatively easy to study. At this point non-linear structures begin to form, and the [[computational problem]] becomes much more difficult, involving, for example, [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulation]]s with billions of particles. The [[Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation]] is a high precision simulation of this era.

These Population III stars are also responsible for turning the few light elements that were formed in the Big Bang (hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium) into many heavier elements. They can be huge as well as perhaps small – and non-[[metallicity|metallic]] (no elements except hydrogen and helium). The larger stars have very short lifetimes compared to most Main Sequence stars we see today, so they commonly finish burning their hydrogen fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years, seeding the universe with heavier elements over repeated generations. They mark the start of the [[Stelliferous era|Stelliferous (starry) era]].

As yet, no Population III stars have been found, so our understanding of them is based on [[computational model]]s of their formation and evolution.  Fortunately, observations of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] radiation can be used to date when star formation began in earnest.  Analysis of such observations made by the European Space Agency's Planck telescope in 2016 concluded that the first generation of stars formed 700 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/planck-first-stars-formed-later-than-we-thought ''Planck: First Stars Formed Later Than We Thought''; NASA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quasar]]s provides some additional evidence of early structure formation. Their light shows evidence of elements such as [[carbon]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]] and [[oxygen]]. This is evidence that by the time quasars formed, a massive phase of [[star formation]] had already taken place, including sufficient generations of [[population III stars]] to give rise to these elements.

=== Reionization===
{{See also|Reionization|Dwarf galaxy|Quasar}}
As the [[population III star|first stars]], [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s gradually form, the intense radiation they emit reionizes much of the surrounding universe; splitting the neutral hydrogen atoms back into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of free [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s for the first time since [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]].

Reionization is evidenced from observations of [[quasar]]s. Quasars are a form of [[active galaxy]], and the most luminous objects observed in the universe. Electrons in neutral hydrogen have a specific patterns of absorbing photons, related to electron energy levels and called the [[Lyman series]]. Ionized hydrogen does not have electron energy levels of this kind. Therefore, light travelling through ionized hydrogen and neutral hydrogen shows different absorption lines. In addition, the light will have travelled for billions of years to reach us, so any absorption by neutral hydrogen will have been redshifted by varied amounts, rather than by one specific amount, indicating when it happened. These features make it possible to study the state of ionization at many different times in the past. They show that reionization began as "bubbles" of ionized hydrogen which became larger over time.&lt;ref name="dijkstra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lyα Emitting Galaxies as a Probe of Reionization|date=5 August 2014|first=Mark|last=Dijkstra|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|doi=10.1017/pasa.2014.33|volume=31|arxiv = 1406.7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show that the absorption was due to the general state of the universe (the [[intergalactic medium]]) and not due to passing through galaxies or other dense areas.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt; Reionization might have started as early as ''z''=16 (250 million years of cosmic time) and was complete by around ''z''=9 or 10 (500 million years). The epoch of reionization probably ended by around ''z''=5 or 6 (1 billion years) as the era of Population III stars and quasars – and their intense radiation – came to an end, and the ionized hydrogen gradually reverted to neutral atoms.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt;

These observations have narrowed down the period of time during which reionization took place, but the source of the photons that caused reionization is still not completely certain. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to [[ultraviolet]] photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter, implying that the sources must have produced significant amount of ultraviolet and higher energy.

However, by this time, matter had become far more spread out due to the ongoing expansion of the universe. Although the neutral hydrogen atoms were again ionized, the plasma was much more thin and diffuse, and photons were much less likely to be scattered. Despite being reionized, the universe remained largely transparent during reionization. As the universe continued to cool and expand, reionization gradually ended.

Matter continues to draw together under the influence of [[gravity]], to form [[galaxy|galaxies]]. The stars from this time period, known as  [[Stellar population|Population II]] stars, are formed early on in this process, with more recent [[Stellar population|Population I]] stars formed later. Gravitational attraction also gradually pulls galaxies towards each other to form groups, [[galactic cluster|cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s.

== Current appearance of the Universe==

The universe has appeared much the same as it does now, for many billions of years. It will continue to look similar for many more billions of years into the future.

Based upon the emerging science of [[nucleocosmochronology]], the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way is estimated to have been formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Peloso/&gt;

=== Dark energy dominated era===
{{main|dark energy|Scale factor (cosmology)}}
:''From about 9.8 billion years after the Big bang''
From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large-scale behavior is believed to have gradually changed for the third time in its history. Its behavior had originally been dominated by radiation ([[special relativity|relativistic]] constituents such as photons and neutrinos) for the first 47,000 years, and since about 377,000 years of cosmic time, its behavior had been dominated by [[matter]]. During its matter-dominated era, the expansion of the universe had begun to slow down, as [[gravity]] reigned in the initial outward expansion. But from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, observations show that that the expansion of the universe slowly stops decelerating, and gradually begins to accelerate again, instead. 

While the precise cause is not known, the observation is accepted as correct by the cosmologist community. By far the most accepted understanding is that this is due to an unknown form of energy which has been given the name "[[dark energy]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The cosmological constant and dark energy|year=2003|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=astro-ph/0207347|volume=75|issue=2|pages=559–606|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.559|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..559P|last1=Peebles|first1=P.

Research is ongoing to understand this dark energy. Dark energy is now believed to be the single largest component of the universe, as it constitutes about 68.3% of the entire [[mass-energy]] of the physical universe.

Dark energy is believed to act like a [[cosmological constant]] - a [[scalar field]] that exists throughout space. Unlike gravity, the effects of such a field do not diminish (or only diminish slowly) as the universe grows. While matter and gravity have a greater effect initially, their effect quickly diminishes as the universe continues to expand. Objects in the universe, which are initially seen to be moving apart as the universe expands, continue to move apart, but their outward motion gradually slows down. This slowing effect becomes smaller as the universe becomes more spread out. Eventually, the outward and repulsive effect of dark energy begins to dominate over the inward pull of gravity. Instead of slowing down and perhaps beginning to move inward under the influence of gravity, from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, the expansion of space starts to slowly accelerate ''outward'' at a gradually ''increasing'' rate.

==Far future and ultimate fate==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe|Timeline of the far future}}
{{further|Future of an expanding universe|Heat death of the universe}}

The universe has existed for around 13.8 billion years, and we believe that we understand it well enough to predict its large-scale development for many billions of years into the future – perhaps as much as 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years from now). Beyond that, we need to better understand the universe to make any accurate predictions. Therefore, the universe could follow a variety of different paths beyond this time.

There are several competing scenarios for the possible long-term evolution of the universe. Which of them will happen, if any, depends on the precise values of [[physical constant]]s such as the [[cosmological constant]], the possibility of [[proton decay]], the [[False vacuum|energy of the vacuum]] (meaning, the energy of [[Vacuum state|"empty" space]] itself), and the natural laws [[beyond the Standard Model]].

[[File:Red dwarf lifetime.png|right|thumb|The predicted main-sequence lifetime of a red dwarf plotted against its mass relative to the Sun&lt;ref name="Adams2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 2004RMxAC..22...46A |title= Gravitational Collapse: From Massive Stars to Planets — Red Dwarfs and the End of the Main Sequence |url=http://www.astroscu.unam.mx/rmaa/RMxAC..22/PDF/RMxAC..22_adams.pdf |editors=G.

If the expansion of the universe continues and it stays in its present form, eventually all but the nearest galaxies will be carried away from us by the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] at such a velocity that our [[observable universe]] will be limited to [[Laniakea Supercluster|our own]] gravitationally bound local [[galactic cluster]]. In the very long term (after many trillions – thousands of billions – of years, cosmic time), the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end, as stars cease to be born and even the [[red dwarf star|longest-lived stars]] gradually die. Beyond this, all objects in the universe will cool and (with the [[proton decay|possible exception of protons]]) gradually decompose back to their constituent particles and then into subatomic particles and very low level photons and other [[fundamental particle]]s, by a variety of possible processes. But this will take a duration of time that is almost inconceivable to most people, compared to which the entire 13.8 billion years of the universe would be a tiny instant in time.

Ultimately, in the extreme future, the following scenarios have been proposed for the ultimate fate of the universe.

{| class=wikitable
|-
| '''[[Heat death of the universe|Heat Death]]'''
| As expansion continues, the universe becomes larger, colder, and more dilute; in time, all structures eventually decompose to subatomic particles and photons.
| In the case of indefinitely continuing [[metric expansion of space]], the energy density in the universe will decrease until, after an estimated time of  10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; years, it reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and no more structure will be possible. This will happen only after an extremely long time because first, all matter will collapse into [[black hole]]s, which will then evaporate extremely slowly via [[Hawking radiation]]. The universe in this scenario will cease to be able to support life much earlier than this, after some 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; years or so, when  [[star formation]] ceases.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337|title=A dying universe: The long-term fate and evolutionof astrophysical objects|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=69|issue=2|pages=337–372|last1=Adams|first1=Fred C|last2=Laughlin|first2=Gregory|year=1997|arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IID.&lt;/sup&gt;  In some [[grand unified theories]], [[proton decay]] after at least 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; years will convert the remaining interstellar gas and stellar remnants into leptons (such as positrons and electrons) and photons. Some positrons and electrons will then recombine into photons.&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IV,&amp;nbsp;§VF.&lt;/sup&gt; In this case, the universe has reached a high-[[entropy]] state consisting of a bath of particles and low-energy radiation. It is not known however whether it eventually achieves [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§VIB,&amp;nbsp;VID.&lt;/sup&gt; The hypothesis of a universal heat death stems from the 1850s ideas of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] ([[Lord Kelvin]])&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1851). "On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule's equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam." Excerpts. [§§1–14 &amp; §§99–100], ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', March, 1851; and ''Philosophical Magazine'' IV. 1852, [from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. XLVIII, pp. 174]&lt;/ref&gt; who extrapolated the theory of heat views of mechanical energy loss in nature, as embodied in the first two laws of thermodynamics, to universal operation.
|-
| '''[[Big Rip]]'''
| Expansion of space accelerates and at some point becomes so extreme that even subatomic particles and the fabric of [[spacetime]] are pulled apart and unable to exist.
| For sufficiently large values for the [[dark energy]] content of the universe, the expansion rate of the universe will continue to increase without limit. Gravitationally bound systems, such as clusters of galaxies, galaxies, and ultimately the Solar System will be torn apart. Eventually the expansion will be so rapid as to overcome the electromagnetic forces holding molecules and atoms together. Even atomic nuclei will be torn apart. Finally, forces and interactions even on the [[Planck scale]] – the smallest size for which the notion of "space" currently has a meaning – will no longer be able to occur as the fabric of [[spacetime]] itself is pulled apart and the universe as we know it will end in an unusual kind of singularity.
|-
| '''[[Big Crunch]]'''
| Expansion eventually slows and halts, then reverses as all matter accelerates towards its common centre. Not now considered likely.
| In the opposite of the "Big Rip" scenario, the [[metric expansion of space]] would at some point be reversed and the universe would contract towards a hot, dense state. This is a required element of [[oscillatory universe]] scenarios, such as the [[cyclic model]], although a Big Crunch does not necessarily imply an oscillatory universe. Current observations suggest that this model of the universe is unlikely to be correct, and the expansion will continue or even accelerate.
|-
| '''[[Vacuum instability]]'''
| Collapse of the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, to a different form.
| Cosmology traditionally has assumed a stable or at least  [[metastability|metastable]] universe, but the possibility of a [[false vacuum]] in [[quantum field theory]] implies that the universe at any point in spacetime might spontaneously collapse into a lower energy state (see [[Bubble nucleation]]), a more stable or "true vacuum", which would then expand outward from that point with the speed of light.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is our vacuum metastable? |journal=Nature |volume=298 |date=1982 |issue=5875 |pages=633–634 |doi=10.1038/298633a0 |bibcode=1982Natur.298..633T |url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/%2872%29vacuum_metastable.pdf |access-date=2015-10-31|last1=Turner |first1=M.

H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect would be that the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, would undergo a transition to a more stable form. New forces and particles would replace the present ones we know of, with the side effect that all current particles, forces and structures would be destroyed and subsequently (if able) reform into different particles, forces and structures.
|}

In this kind of extreme timescale, extremely rare [[quantum mechanics|quantum phenomena]] may also occur that are extremely unlikely to be seen on a timescale smaller than trillions of years. These may also lead to unpredictable changes to the state of the universe which would not be likely to be significant on any smaller timescale. For example, on a timescale of millions of trillions of years, [[black hole]]s might appear to evaporate almost instantly, uncommon [[quantum tunneling]] phenomena would appear to be common, and quantum (or other) phenomena so unlikely that they might occur just once in a trillion years may occur many times.

A '''common year''' is a [[calendar year]] with 365 [[day]]s.  More generally, a common year is one without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]].  The [[Gregorian calendar]], (like the earlier [[Julian calendar]]), employs both common years and leap years to keep the calendar aligned with the [[tropical year]], which does not contain an exact number of days.

The common year of 365 days has 52 [[week]]s and one day, hence a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week (for example, January 1 and December 31 fell on a Sunday in 2017) and the year following a common year will start on the subsequent day of the week. In common years, February has four weeks, so March will begin on the same day of the week. November will also begin on this day.

In the Gregorian calendar, 303 of every 400 years are common years. By comparison, in the [[Julian calendar]], 300 out of every 400 years are common years, and in the [[Revised Julian calendar]] (used by Greece) 682 out of every 900 years are common years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3678">A '''crash cover''' is a [[Philately|philatelic]] term for a type of [[Cover (philately)|cover]],  (including the terms '''air accident cover''', '''interrupted flight cover''', '''wreck cover''') meaning an envelope or package that has been recovered from a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], [[airship]] or [[aeroplane]] crash, train wreck, [[shipwreck]] or other accident. Crash covers are a type of [[interrupted mail]].

[[File:Crash Cover Nov 2 1929.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Example of a salvaged U.S. Air Mail Crash Cover (CAM #24, Indianapolis, IN, Nov. 2, 1929)]] [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Crashes]] of flights carrying [[airmail]] were a regular occurrence from the earliest days of mail transport by air. In many cases of [[aircraft]] crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces if there had been a fire, or water damage from [[flying boat]] crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a [[postal marking]] (cachet), label, or [[mimeograph]] that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an "ambulance cover" or "body bag" if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination.

Aviation related crash covers are a specialised collecting area of [[aerophilately]] and are much-prized items of [[postal history]], because they are generally rare, but as tangible artifacts of often-tragic accidents they have a story to tell. The 367 covers salvaged from the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] are especially desirable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsnewyork.org/covers/crash.html Collecting Air Crash Covers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Hindenburg.html Hindenburg crash covers]&lt;/ref&gt; with prices ranging from US$10,000 and up; a cover at the [[Corinphila]] auction in May 2001 realized 85,000 Swiss francs (US$75,000).

The [[American Air Mail Society]] has a "Crash Cover Committee" specializing in the study of crash covers. There is also a Wreck &amp; Crash Mail Society, whose members collect all types of crash &amp; wreck covers.

==Early life==
Monn was born and raised in [[Fayetteville, Pennsylvania|Fayetteville]], Pennsylvania as one of six children. As a child, he showed an early interest in fashion design with hopes of attending the [[Parsons School of Design]]. In 1981 at age 18, Monn earned a job at Butte Knit, a clothing factory in his town that was a part of the Jonathan Logan Corporation. This job soon led him to New York City where he rented a studio apartment near [[Mindy Grossman]]'s. While in New York, Monn took up interior decorating for himself and his friends (including Grossman).&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt;

==Career==
Prior to beginning his event and interior design career, Monn worked in the jewelry business for 12 years. In 2003, Gayfryd Steinberg hired Monn as the event planner and designer for the Library Lions Gala at the New York Public Library's main campus. Since then, Monn has been designing events for a wide variety of occasions.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gordon| first=Amanda| title =Authentic, Simple &amp; Refined: A Night With David Monn| newspaper =[[The New York Sun]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =August 14, 2008 | url =http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/authentic-simple-refined-a-night-with-david-monn/83889/| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he managed the festivities for the grand opening of the [[Time Warner Center]].

In May 2010, Monn designed the [[White House]] State Dinner honoring then [[Mexican President]] [[Felipe Calderón]].&lt;ref name="NYTShopping"/&gt; In November 2016, he released his book, ''David Monn: The Art of Celebrating'', which contains 360 pages of images and text about events he has planned and designed.

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''disaster area''' is a region or a locale, heavily damaged by either natural, technological or social hazards. Disaster areas affect the population living in the community by dramatic increase in expense, loss of energy, food and services; and finally increase the risk of disease for citizens. An area that has been struck with a natural, technological or sociological hazard that opens the affected area for national or international aid.

==Natural hazard==
A natural hazard is a negative process of phenomena created naturally (tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes) that will affect people or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographyfieldwork.com/GeographyVocabularyGCSEFarming.htm |title=Geography vocabulary: Gcse farming|year=February 2012|website=www.geographyfieldwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tornadoes===
'''[[Tornado]]es''' are narrow aggressively rotating mixtures of air that come from the base of a thunderstorm, being the most violent of storms. Tornadoes are usually hard to see unless they form a condensations funnel made from:- dust, water droplets and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSSL: Severe Weather 101: Tornadoes. NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory|accessdate= November 5, 2012|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes take place in several parts of the world, such as Australia, Europe, Africa but mostly occur in the United States, Argentina, and Bangladesh.

===Hurricanes===
[[File:Hurricane Sandy Flooding Avenue C 2012.JPG|thumbnail| New York City after the destruction of [[Hurricane Sandy]]]]

'''[[Hurricane]]s''', [[cyclones]], [[tropical storms]] and [[typhoons]] can be referred to as the same. They combine low pressure and strong winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Tropical cyclones have a low pressure center, rain and strong winds. They usually initiate over tropical or subtropical waters. Hurricanes can be predicted several days before they hit and can be very destructive and destroy homes and some other buildings. Cyclones, although they are the same type of storm, are harder to predict before a few days like hurricanes thus giving people only a few hours of notice to evacuate their homes. In this case there are far more deaths from flooding and high tides. A recent (2012) example of a hurricane is [[Hurricane Sandy]], which was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States, leaving millions without power and a few homeless.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=October 30, 2012|title= Sandy death toll rises, millions without power in u.s|via= CBC News|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/10/30/us-hurricane-sandy-superstorm-damages.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===
'''Floods''' take place when water overflows or submerges land that is usually parched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floods |work=[[IFRC]] |date=November 5, 2012|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/definition-of-hazard/floods/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common way is when rivers or streams overflow their banks. A floodplain is produced when water from a rivers spreads through the land from excessive rain, rapid ice melting, unfortunately placed beaver dam, and ruptured dam. There are two types of floods: general and flash floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Information, Flooding Facts, Flash Floods, Photos -- National Geographic. Environment Facts, Environment Science, Global Warming, Natural Disasters, Ecosystems, Green Living |website= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date= November 5, 2012|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/floods-profile/}}&lt;/ref&gt; General floods are predicted well in advance and usually cause the destruction of housing, people and crops. Flash floods come without warning and are sudden and extreme: A large volume of water flows rapidly and people have to make quick movements if they do not want to be caught in the flood. They have to find high safe ground where the water will not reach them.

===Earthquakes===
When two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past each other in the fault of the earth, it is called an earthquake. Energy released in many forms moves in all directions and causes the ground to shake.&lt;ref name="earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|year=2011|title= Seismic Sources – Earthquakes, Nuclear Blasts, Mining Events|work= Canada's Natural Resources|accessdate= November 5, 2012|url=http://www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/info-gen/faq-eng.php#where}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes earthquakes may have foreshocks, which are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same region which is followed by a larger earthquake. The larger earthquake, called the mainshock, always has aftershocks that follow it. Aftershocks can continue of hours, weeks, months and sometimes even years depending on how big the mainshock was. Earthquakes usually occur on active faults which define major tectonic plates on the Earth. 90% of the world’s earthquakes occur along plate boundaries.&lt;ref name="earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt; Earthquakes can cause much damage, mainly from the ground shaking and leaving cracks in the ground. Sometimes it can also cause buildings to collapse and cause deaths.

==Technological hazards==
===Technical hazards===

[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Fukushima I [[Nuclear Power Plant]] after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Reactor 1 to 4 from left to right.]]
There are several technical hazards one should be aware of as they pose a threat humans and their values. These hazards are measured in terms of the risk they pose to the community using them. Technical hazards are classified by a source, specifically speaking; they can fall under automotive emissions, medical radiation, explosions and air pollution (environmental) hazards. The quality of the hazard determines the safety precautions that are taken. For example, hazards can be a risk to an individual or a risk to the population. If the population is at risk with the hazard, there will be more priorities for the management of the hazardous material. These hazardous materials can cause illness or even death to an individual if they are not address accordingly, so it is crucial for them to inform the public about these technical hazards.

===Nuclear and radiation (accidents/incidents)===
There are several thoughts that come to mind when one thinks of the word “nuclear”,&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url=http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf}} {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}	&lt;/ref&gt; whether it be basic chemistry or highly complex explosives; nuclear accidents, nuclear incidences or nuclear terrorism are definitely a threat to the community or the world in that matter. But what is nuclear terrorism exactly? A "nuclear accident, incident, or act of terrorism is an unpredictable, unusual and unwanted event involving radiation and/or radioactive materials."&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt; To specifically distinguish between the three, nuclear accidents are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. Nuclear incidents on the other hand are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt;

===Nuclear accident===
'''Nuclear accidents''' are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. There are several examples of these nuclear accidents taken place around the world. To start off, a prime example of a [[nuclear accident]] would be [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|Palo mares B-52 Accident]]. On January 17, 1966, a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[B-52]] [[bomber]] collided with a mid-tanker airplane that was being refueled at 31000 feet. When the two airplanes collided, the tanker airplane exploded completely killing all crew members, while the B-52 bomber split in half killing a small proportion of the crew. When the airplane split in half, four bombs dropped from the sky. Two of them detonated, causing 2 kilometers of land to be contaminated by radioactive plutonium. The fourth explosive was recovered when it was discovered that it landed on the sea. The soil on the contaminated area had to be removed and placed in barrels, to reduce the amount of pollution having been caused by the nuclear explosive.

===Nuclear incident===
'''Nuclear incidents''' are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url= http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Secondary example would be the Johnston Atoll Incident that occurred on July 25, 1962. They decided to conduct the experiment at Christmas Island on Johnson Atoll, where they set off 36 nuclear explosions. One of the missile launches went wrong as it malfunctioned when trying to launch. The leaders decided to detonate the missile before it launched. When it detonated, the entire island was covered with radioactive plutonium. The witnesses claimed that 85% of the people suffered from [[radioactive contamination]] that created cancer and other radioactive related diseases. Plus those who were present at the site of the explosion suffered from infertility, and other body deformations.

==Sociological hazards==
Sociological hazards that create a disaster area are [[riots]], [[terrorism]], and [[war]].

===Riot===
A riot is defined as a noisy, violent public disturbance caused by  a group or a crowd (three or more people) usually protesting against another group or government policy in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riot -  Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=November 1, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/riot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK London riot in August 2011, for example, was started due to the shooting of [[Mark Duggan]] by the London police.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuchs|first= C. |year=2012|title= Behind the News: Social Media, Riots and Revolution. Capital and Class, 36(3), 383-391|accessdate=November 1, 2012 |url=http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/36/3/383.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters came together destroying neighborhoods and streets violently damaging property to protest the police's actions that happened a few days prior.&lt;ref name="Fuchs" /&gt; Riots increase expenses to repair costly damages putting the city in distress.

===Terrorism===
[[File:North face south tower after plane strike 9-11.jpg|thumb|[[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] burning down during the [[9/11 attacks]].]]

Terrorism is defined as acts of violence and threats by a group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/terrorism|title=terrorism|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorism occurs with an unexpected attack on [[non-combatants]] to create fear and panic having a detrimental consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorism. The American Heritage: New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition|date= November 5, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrorist attacks]] create a massive, costly impact on the society. Not only is there large amount of property damage that may not be able to be repaired, there is also a large impact on citizens. People lose loved ones and suffer from their own health being impacted. The [[9/11|9/11 terrorist attack]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|twin towers]] in [[New York City]] marks one of the largest attacks on the United States.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gong|first1= H.|last2= Keenan|first2= K. |year=2012|title= The Impact of 9/11 on the Geography of Financial Services in New York. The Professional Geographer, 64(3), 370-388|accessdate=November 4, 2012|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Twin Towers were completely destroyed, damaging the surrounding buildings as well as causing the loss of many lives. People suffered from health problems from inhaling the sediments from the crumbling towers. The financial and social impact is still present thirteen years later in today's society.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; It is concluded that New York City still suffers from a post-disaster decline in financial services.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; New York City is a Disaster area due to the sociological hazard of terrorism.

===War===
War defined as a period where conflict is carried out as an act of hostility by [[armed forces]] between two or more nations or [[Civil war|within a nation]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/war war]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan, for example would be a sociological hazard causing disaster areas because it is considered a war zone. There has been an ongoing battle between United States and the Taliban in Afghanistan resulting in a war zone.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boettcher|first= M. |year=2011|title=They were Hunting and Killing Us: Abc News' Mike Boettcher Caught in Taliban Firefight with U.S. Troops in Afghanistan|work= ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/abc-news-mike-boettcher-caught-taliban-firefight-us/story?id=13702376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constant bombing and shooting marks up Afghanistan destructing property, land and causing threats to the civilians living in the area.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; Thousands have died and international aid for the cost of the war is implemented through tax payers.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; There is lack of resources due to the war area cutting off access to areas because of violence and danger.

==Examples of modern disaster areas==
An example of a '''technological disaster''' was the Fukushima disaster which was caused by a “massive 8.9-magnitude earthquake [that] hit northeast Japan”.&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worst Nuclear Accidents / Disasters in History|year=2011| accessdate=November 5, 2012|url= http://www.smashinglists.com/worst-nuclear-accidents-disasters-in-history/|website=www.smashinglists.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This earthquake caused a [[nuclear explosion]] at a power plant; five reactors were damaged, causing the plant to go into an emergency state. All this occurred because there was a technological error in the system that cut down the regular and emergency power, causing the five reactors to destabilize and explode. This significant nuclear event had a big impact on the public health, as the area suffered nuclear contamination. The contamination caused all the crops such as milk, water or vegetables unsafe to eat. Hence all food grown in that area was banned from being sold. People in the “surroundings were moved to safe shelters,”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt; and 3 people were affected by the radiation alone. Luckily, the “Japanese government [handled] the situation in the most efficient and amazing way that anyone can imagine.”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt;

A recent example of a disaster area caused by a '''natural hazard''' is [[Hurricane Sandy]] which hit October 27, 2012. It was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States. The storm killed about 50 people and many were also hit by falling trees. The hardest-hit state was New York, leaving millions without power and a few homeless. 

A disaster area caused by a '''sociological hazard''' would be the terrorist attack on [[September 11th, 2001]], in New York City. Two airplanes struck the Twin Towers, causing them to crumble, killing many people in the process.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masud|first= E. |year=2006|title= What Really Happened on September 11 Remains a Mystery |work=The Wisdom Fund|accessdate= November 5, 2012 |url=http://www.twf.org/News/Y2002/0427-Mystery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected attack harmed many people and had a detrimental impact on New York City.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''''Enigmarelle''''' was a fake humanoid [[automaton]], in fact with a person concealed inside, which was exhibited as a scientific and technical curiosity around 1905 in the US and Europe, chiefly in theaters. Enigmarelle was claimed to be able to perform several extraordinary tasks, which it demonstrated in performances: these included walking, riding a bicycle, and writing its name on a blackboard.

== Presentation==
Enigmarelle was shown in the US and then in parts of Europe, in [[vaudeville]] theaters and circuses. The booking agent, an American named Frederick J. Ireland, was represented at these appearances as the creator and owner of the automaton.

Enigmarelle was a large automaton and was in fact operated by a human concealed within its body, although the precise operating mechanisms are not known. The operator is believed to have been a performer who had had both his legs [[amputation|amputated]] and who went by the name of Alba W. Root, and who also performed as a bicycle acrobat using leg [[prosthesis|prostheses]]. &lt;!-- is believed to be Alba W. Root, who lost both legs in a train accident as a boy. Enigmarelle was designed to exploit this disability, with removable legs to "prove" its mechanical nature. --&gt;

Enigmarelle was the subject of a short documentary film in 1905&lt;ref group="P"&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan |last=Goble |title=Enigmarelle the Wonderful Automaton - Film / Movie |url=http://www.citwf.com/film423590.htm |website=Complete Index To World Film |access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a detailed "scientific" description with three photos in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1906.&lt;ref group="C"&gt;{{cite news |language=en|title=A Clever Mechanical and Electrical Automaton |periodical=Scientific American |volume=94 |issue=2 |date=1906-01-13 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-clever-mechanical-and-electrical/|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned in some modern publications on automatons.&lt;ref group="P"&gt;{{cite book|language=en|author1=Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume|title=Clockwork Music|location=Australia|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1973|pages=334|isbn=9780047890048|quotation=Another and equally spectacular 'android' was that exhibited at the London Hippodrome in 1905. Called Enigmarelle, this seven-foot high figure possessed incredible abilities. It would walk on to the stage, write its name in somewhat backward-sloping manuscript upon a blackboard, and then ride a bicycle in a circle. Its head was of wax, its feet of steel and its legs of wood and iron. The motive power comprised no less than seven motors-three being spring, and four electric which drew their power from wet-cell batteries concealed in the trunk. Unbuttoning its waistcoat revealed a mass of wheelwork and wires, levers, and cranks. Unfortunately, within all this trumpery there beat no mechanical heart, but that of a real, live man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
The name ''Enigmarelle'' seems to be a [[portmanteau]] of the French words ''énigme'' (enigma) and ''marelle'' ([[hopscotch]]), but the creators of the machine were English speakers, so there is no reason to suppose a French portmanteau is the true origin of the name.

=== Known appearances ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">A '''farewell speech''' or '''farewell address''' is a speech given by an individual leaving a position or place. They are often used by public figures such as politicians as a to the preceding career, or as statements delivered by persons relating to reasons for their leaving. The term is often used as a euphemism for "retirement speech", though it is broader in that it may include geographical or even biological conclusion. In the [[Classics]], a term for a dignified and poetic farewell speech is ''apobaterion'' (ἀποβατήριον), standing opposed to the ''epibaterion'', the corresponding speech made upon arrival.

== U.S. presidential farewell addresses ==
Many U.S. presidential speeches have been given the moniker "farewell address" since George Washington's address in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4624166/presidential-farewell-addresses/|title=Barack Obama's Farewell Address and 6 Other Memorable Presidential Goodbyes|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable examples:

* [[George Washington]] – [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] where he warned of the dangers of [[Political party|political parties]] and [[Washington Doctrine of Unstable Alliances|foreign alliances]].

*[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] – [[Eisenhower's farewell address]] where he warned of the [[military–industrial complex]].
*[[Barack Obama]] – [[Barack Obama's farewell address|Obama's farewell address]] made from Chicago, breaking tradition of holding one in the White House.

==Other notable farewell speeches==

*The speech of [[Aeneas]] to [[Helenus]] and [[Andromache]], ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book III.
*[[Robert E. Lee]] – [[Lee's Farewell Address]] to the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] the day after the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].
*[[Douglas MacArthur]] – farewell speeches before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]]; "[[Wikisource:MacArthur's Farewell Speech to Congress|old soldiers never die, they only fade away]]" and "[[Wikisource:Duty, honor, country|duty, honor, country]]".

== History ==

GigMasters was founded in 1997 by New York area entrepreneurs Michael Caldwell and Kevin Kinyon. In February of that year, the company launched the first version of its website. In September 2010, GigMasters raised $200,000 in expansion funding from investor James Marciano.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 2013, about half of the company's booking were wedding-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/fading-glory-demand-elvis-impersonators-isnt-what-it-used-be "Fading glory: Demand for Elvis impersonators isn't what it used to be"]. ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'',  September 7, 2013.  by LAURA CARROLL&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, the company raised $1.3 million in series A funding by [[XO Group]], parent company of TheKnot.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digiday.com/media/bridal-publishers-tie-knot-content-commerce/ "Bridal publishers tie the knot between content and commerce"].

In September 2014, Inc. Magazine ranked GigMasters as one of the nation's 5000 fastest growing private companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2014/state/ct Top Companies in Connecticut on the 2014 Inc. 5000] ''INC'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2015, the Caldwell and Kinyon, creators of GigMasters, sold the company for $8.5 million to [[XO Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/The-Knot-owner-buys-Norwalk-s-GigMasters-6550809.php "The Knot owner buys Norwalk‘s GigMasters"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Global news flow''' (also referred to as '''international news flow''') is a field of study that deals with the news coverage of events in foreign countries. It describes and explains the flow of news from one country to another.&lt;ref name="segev"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/31394|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|last=Segev|first=Elad|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2016|isbn=9781433129841|location=New York|page=139-153|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on global news flow typically attempt to understand why certain countries are more newsworthy than others..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kariel|first1=Herbert G.|last2=Rosenvall|first2=Lynn A.|title=Factors influencing international news flow|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1984|volume=61|issue=3|page=509-516|doi=10.1177/107769908406100305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K., &amp; Barnett, G. A. (1996). The determinants of international news flow a network analysis. Communication Research, 23(3), 323-352.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the years it has been found that the economic power of countries plays a particularly crucial role in their news prominence&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segev|first1=Elad|last2=Blondheim|first2=Menahem|title=America's global standing according to popular news sites from around the world|journal=Political Communication|date=2013|volume=30|issue=1|page=139-161|doi=10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the presence of international news agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, H. D. (2000). Systemic determinants of international news coverage: A comparison of 38 countries. Journal of Communication, 50(2), 110-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the US has been found to be very prominent in news mentions around the world (18%), followed by China, Western European and Middle Eastern countries (about 3-5% each).&lt;ref name="segev" /&gt;

The unequal representation of the world and the under-representation of [[developing countries]] have been already of a great concern at least since the 1950s, since they influence the way people perceive the world and the image of countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1954). How Nations See Each Other? Paris: UNESCO Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was later addressed in the [[MacBride report]], and his set of recommendations for a [[New World Information and Communication Order]]. The unequal representation of the world has been also linked to the [[World System Theory]], and the unequal economic structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T. K. (1998). All Countries Not Created Equal to Be News World System and International Communication. Communication research, 25(5), 528-563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent empirical studies&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=Visible and invisible countries: News flow theory revised|journal=Journalism|date=2015|volume=16|issue=3|page=412-428|doi=10.1177/1464884914521579|url=http://jou.sagepub.com/content/16/3/412|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that among online news websites and [[news aggregators]] the unequal representation of the world has been perpetuated and even further intensified. Economically powerful countries, as well as their opponent countries (mainly in the Middle East and Asia) get the most news coverage around the world.

==Fashion and promotion==
Supersonic is a graduate of the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]]. She launched the denim brand I.B.I.V. during her university student years. Within three months of their launch, the jeans were featured on the cover of ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'', have also been featured on [[MTV]], ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} She has designed hats for [[Pamela Anderson]],&lt;ref name=nypost2&gt;{{cite news|title=Tommy Lee's Latest Love|work=New York Post|date=July 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carmen Electra]], [[Snoop Dogg]],&lt;ref name=MJS&gt;{{cite news|title=Note Worthy|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=September 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], among others.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=nypost&gt;{{cite news|first=George|last=Rush|title=Liam Finds Oasis in Ivy League|work=Daily News|location=New York|date=June 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivysupersonic.com/hats/ IVY Supersonic - HATS Collection &amp; Gallery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reality television|Reality TV]] star [[Omarosa Manigault]] wore a hat designed by Ivy on the season finale of'' [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Supersonic has held parties for ''Mira! Magazine'' and adult actress [[Gina Lynn]].&lt;ref name=NYP&gt;{{cite news|title=Simmons In All-Night Prowl|work=The New York Post|date=July 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a cartoon character of herself tattooed on her by [[Kat Von D]] for the TV show ''[[Miami Ink]]''. She originated the Ivy Supersonic cartoon at Universal Music Group, but bought it back in 2002, when Universal had a high staff turn over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prwebdirect.com/releases/2006/10/prweb445793.htm PR: Miami Ink TV Commercial with Ivy Supersonic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114040835/http://www.prwebdirect.com/releases/2006/10/prweb445793.htm |date=2006-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivy had 17 tattoos done in 30 days to protest the Sqrat case.

==Feuds, provocations and incidents==
===Sqrat===
In one of her many "public feuds" Ivy claims that the idea for the character [[Scrat]] from the movie ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' was stolen from her after she pitched her character ''Sqrat'', a cross between a [[squirrel]] and a [[rat]] that she claims to have seen in Madison Square Park to [[20th Century Fox]] movie executives. Ivy claims she created the character in 1999 and has the trademark to prove it. A [[CNN]] report by [[Jeanie Moos]] of Ivy claims was aired in 2000, two years before ''Ice Age'' went into development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivysupersonic.com/ivid/cnn2000.shtml Videos on IvySupersonic.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivy claims she was offered a $300,000 settlement by Fox but turned it down, and subsequently lost the case at both the trial and appellate level.&lt;ref&gt;242 Fed. Appx. 720 (2d Cir. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ivy has continued her "Make Rupert Murdoch Pay" campaign in hopes of still receiving damages for her perceived infringement.

===Plumm Nightclub===
On October 27, 2007, Ivy started another public feud with New York nightclub, Plumm, over $1000. Ivy claims she is owed for a party she claims she hosted at the nightclub. Supersonic admitted to defacing the club after Plumm refused to pay her the money she claimed to be owed. Supersonic faced felony vandalism charges, but through a plea did minimal jail  time and community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Foxley|title=Ivy Supersonic Update|publisher=New York Observer|url=http://www.observer.com/2007/ivy-supersonic-update|date=November 12, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217051607/http://www.observer.com/2007/ivy-supersonic-update|archivedate=December 17, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ivy Supersonic: 'I Don't Want to Go to Jail I'm 95 lbs'|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/pop_culture/ivy_supersonic_i_donat_want_to_go_to_jail_im_95_lbs_71085.asp|date=November 14, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Tyra Banks Show''===
Supersonic was thrown off ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]'' on October 26, 2007, after producers did not like her tattoos showing through her dress. Ivy was given a shirt to cover the tattoos up but instead ripped the shirt and threw it on the floor and was subsequently asked to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Johnson|title=Tattoos Get Tyra Bounced|publisher=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/10282007/gossip/pagesix/tattoos_get_tyra_bounced.htm|date=October 28, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224162655/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10282007/gossip/pagesix/tattoos_get_tyra_bounced.htm|archivedate=December 24, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supermodel thrown off Banks' show|publisher=Indo-Asian News Service|date=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tabloid Tidbits|publisher=msnbc.com|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21518413/|date=October 29, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bernie Madoff===
In 2009 she was summonsed after sneaking a recording device into the sentencing portion of the trial of infamous financier [[Bernie Madoff]].&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/howard-stern-wack-packer-ivy-supersonic-bellevue-police-article-1.401560&lt;/ref&gt; In the act she was arrested by the [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|Federal Protective Service]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-howard-stern-tried-to-hack-the-madoff-sentencing-2009-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent years==
Ivy Supersonic does not appear to have been publicly visible during the 2010s.  Her website was still up as of 2017 but its news page had no entries past 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://ivysmedia.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_page=3&lt;/ref&gt;

However in 2017 as Ivy Silberstein she had a show of her artwork, particularly her watercolors, in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58f4ef23e4b015669722514e&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''leap year''' (also known as an '''intercalary year''' or '''bissextile year''') is a [[calendar year]] containing one additional day (or, in the case of [[lunisolar calendar]]s, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the [[astronomical year|astronomical]] or [[seasonal year]].&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;{{citation|last1 = Meeus | first1=Jean | date = 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithims | publisher = Willmann-Bell | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track. By inserting (also called ''[[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalating]]'') an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is called a common year.

For example, in the [[Gregorian calendar]], each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by [[February 29|extending February to 29 days]] rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in years which are multiples of four (with the exception of centennial years not divisible by 400). Similarly, in the lunisolar [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Adar 1|Adar Aleph]], a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the [[Bahá'í Calendar]], a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the [[vernal equinox]].

The name "leap year" probably comes from the fact that while a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day (from March 1 through February 28 of the following year) will advance two days due to the extra day (thus "leaping over" one of the days in the week).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Douglas | last=Harper | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=leap+year&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | title = leap year | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/leap-year|title=leap year - Definition of leap year in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English | accessdate = June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Christmas Day]] (December 25) fell on a Sunday in 2016, and Monday in 2017, then it will fall on Tuesday in 2018, and Wednesday in 2019 but then "leaps" over Thursday to fall on a Friday in 2020.

The length of a day is also occasionally changed by the insertion of [[leap second]]s into [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), owing to the variability of Earth's rotational period. Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule, since the variability in the length of the day is not entirely predictable.

[[File:Leap Centuries.jpg|thumb|right|An image showing which century years are leap years in the Gregorian calendar.]]
In the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, most years that are multiples of 4 are leap years. In each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a [[tropical year]] by almost 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Ed. K. Lee |last1=Lerner |first2=Brenda W. |last2=Lerner |title=Calendar |encyclopedia=The Gale Encyclopedia of Science |year=2004 |publisher=[[Gale]] |location=Detroit, MI |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some exceptions to this basic rule are required since the duration of a tropical year is slightly less than 365.25 days. The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars]. (15 May 2013). [[United States Naval Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day ''every'' four years amounts to about three extra days. The Gregorian calendar therefore drops three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its ''leap cycle''. This is done by dropping February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.&lt;ref name="usno"&gt;{{citation | author = United States Naval Observatory | authorlink = United States Naval Observatory | date = June 14, 2011 | url = http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/leap_years.php | title = Leap Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lerner|Lerner|2004|p=681}} The years 1600, 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2300 are common years.

The Gregorian calendar was designed to keep the [[vernal equinox]] on or close to March 21, so that the date of [[Easter]] (celebrated on the Sunday after the ecclesiastical [[full moon]] that falls on or after March 21) remains close to the vernal equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = E.

===Algorithm===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DISCUSS ALGORITHM ON TALK PAGE BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES --&gt;

The following [[pseudocode]] determines whether a year is a ''leap year'' or a ''common year'' in the Gregorian calendar (and in the proleptic Gregorian calendar before 1582). The ''year'' variable being tested is the integer representing the number of the year in the Gregorian calendar, and the tests are arranged to dispatch the most common cases first. Care should be taken in translating mathematical integer divisibility into specific programming languages.

'''if''' (''year'' is not [[divisor|divisible]] by 4) '''then''' (it is a common year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else if''' (''year'' is not divisible by 100) '''then''' (it is a leap year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else if''' (''year'' is not divisible by 400) '''then''' (it is a common year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else''' (it is a leap year)

The algorithm applies to proleptic Gregorian calendar years before 1, but only if the year is expressed with [[astronomical year numbering]]. It is not valid for the BC or BCE notation. The algorithm is not necessarily valid for years in the Julian calendar, such as years before 1752 in the British Empire.  The year 1700 was a leap year in the Julian calendar, but not in the Gregorian calendar.

===Leap day===
{{Main|February 29}}
[[File:Calendar-leapyeardate.jpg|thumb|right|A Swedish pocket calendar from 2008 showing February 29]]
[[File:Japanese Calendar with Verses by Osman Edwards 1900 February.jpg|thumb|February 1900 calendar showing that 1900 was not a leap year]]

February 29 is a date that usually occurs every four years, and is called leap day. This day is added to the calendar in leap years as a corrective measure, because the Earth does not orbit the sun in precisely 365 days.

The Gregorian calendar is a modification of the [[Julian calendar]] first used by the Romans. The [[Roman calendar]] originated as a lunisolar calendar and named many of its days after the [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygies]] of the moon: the new moon (''Kalendae'' or calends, hence "calendar") and the full moon (''Idus'' or ides). The ''Nonae'' or nones was not the first [[Lunar phase|quarter moon]] but was exactly one ''nundina'' or Roman market week of nine days before the ides, inclusively counting the ides as the first of those nine days. This is what we would call a period of eight days. In 1825, [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] believed that the lunisolar calendar was abandoned about 450 BC by the [[decemvirs]], who implemented the [[Roman calendar|Roman Republican calendar]], used until 46 BC. The days of these calendars were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so February 24 was ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' ("the sixth day before the calends of March") often abbreviated a. d. VI Kal. Mart. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] counted days inclusively in their calendars, so this was actually the fifth day before March 1 when counted in the modern exclusive manner (not including the starting day).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Thomas Hewitt | last = Key | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html | title = Calendarium | publisher = University of Chicago | orig-year = 1875 | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican calendar's intercalary month was inserted on the first or second day after the [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminalia]] (a. d. VII Kal. Mar., February 23). The remaining days of Februarius were dropped. This intercalary month, named Intercalaris or [[Mercedonius]], contained 27 days. The religious festivals that were normally celebrated in the last five days of February were moved to the last five days of Intercalaris. Because only 22 or 23 days were effectively added, not a full lunation, the calends and ides of the Roman Republican calendar were no longer associated with the new moon and full moon.

The Julian calendar, which was developed in 46 BC by [[Julius Caesar]], and became effective in 45 BC, distributed an extra ten days among the months of the Roman Republican calendar. Caesar also replaced the intercalary month by a single intercalary day, located where the intercalary month used to be. To create the intercalary day, the existing ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' (February 24) was doubled, producing ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias''. Hence, the year containing the doubled day was a bissextile (''bis sextum'', "twice sixth") year. For legal purposes, the two days of the ''bis sextum'' were considered to be a single day, with the second half being intercalated; but in common practice by 238, when [[Censorinus]] wrote, the intercalary day was followed by the last five days of February, a. d. VI, V, IV, III and pridie Kal. Mart. (the days numbered 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 from the beginning of February in a common year), so that the intercalated day was the ''first'' half of the doubled day. Thus the intercalated day was effectively inserted between the 23rd and 24th days of February. All later writers, including [[Macrobius]] about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter), continued to state that the bissextum (bissextile day) occurred before the last five days of February.

[[File:MissaleLeapYear.jpg|thumb|right|In the older [[Roman Missal]], feast days falling on or after February 24 are celebrated one day later in leap year.]]
Until 1970, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] always celebrated the feast of [[Saint Matthias]] on a. d. VI Kal. Mart., so if the days were numbered from the beginning of the month, it was named February 24 in common years, but the presence of the bissextum in a bissextile year immediately before a. d. VI Kal. Mart. shifted the latter day to February 25 in leap years, with the [[Vigil]] of St. Matthias shifting from February 23 to the leap day of February 24. This shift did not take place in pre-Reformation Norway and Iceland; [[Pope Alexander III]] ruled that either practice was lawful ([[Liber Extra]], 5. 40. 14. 1). Other feasts normally falling on February 25–28 in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the Roman notation). The practice is still observed by those who use the older calendars.

=== Synchronized calendars (Bengali, Indian and Thai) ===
The Revised [[Bengali Calendar]] of Bangladesh and the [[Indian National Calendar]] organise their leap years so that the every leap day is close to a February 29 in the Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This makes it easy to convert dates to or from Gregorian.

The [[Thai solar calendar]] uses the [[Buddhist Era]] (BE), but has been synchronized with the Gregorian since [[AD]] 1941.

==Julian, Coptic and Ethiopian calendars==
From AD 8 the Julian calendar received an extra day added to February in years that are multiples of 4.

The [[Coptic calendar]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]] also add an extra day to the end of the year once every four years before a Julian 29-day February.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.25 days. However, it is 11 minutes longer than a tropical year. This means that the vernal equinox moves a day earlier in the calendar about every 131 years.

==Revised Julian calendar==
The [[Revised Julian calendar]] adds an extra day to February in years that are multiples of four, except for years that are multiples of 100 that do not leave a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. This rule agrees with the rule for the Gregorian calendar until 2799. The first year that dates in the Revised Julian calendar will not agree with those in the Gregorian calendar will be 2800, because it will be a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not in the Revised Julian calendar.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.242222 days. This is a very good approximation to the ''mean'' tropical year, but because the ''vernal equinox'' year is slightly longer, the Revised Julian calendar for the time being does not do as good a job as the Gregorian calendar at keeping the vernal equinox on or close to March 21.

==Chinese calendar==
The [[Chinese calendar]] is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], so a leap year has an extra month, often called an ''embolismic'' month after the Greek word for it. In the Chinese calendar the [[leap month]] is added according to a rule which ensures that month 11 is always the month that contains the northern winter [[solstice]]. The intercalary month takes the same number as the preceding month; for example, if it follows the second month (二月) then it is simply called "leap second month" i.e. {{zh|t=閏二月|s=闰二月|p=rùn'èryuè}}.

==Hebrew calendar==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jewish holiday]] --&gt;
The Hebrew calendar is lunisolar with an [[embolismic month]]. This extra month is called ''Adar Alef'' ([[Adar 1|first Adar]]) and is added before ''[[Adar]]'', which then becomes ''Adar Bet'' ([[Adar 2|second Adar]]). According to the [[Metonic cycle]], this is done seven times every nineteen years (specifically, in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19). This is to ensure that [[Passover]] ({{transl|he|''Pesah''}}) is always in the spring as required by the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) in many verses&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 23,15 ; Exodus 34,18 ; Deuteronomy 15,1 ; Deuteronomy 15, 13&lt;/ref&gt; relating to Passover.

In addition, the Hebrew calendar has postponement rules that postpone the start of the year by one or two days. These postponement rules reduce the number of different combinations of year length and starting [[Week-day names|days of the week]] from 28 to 14, and regulate the location of certain religious holidays in relation to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. In particular, the first day of the Hebrew year can never be Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo adu rosh''}}" ({{lang|he|לא אד"ו ראש}}), i.e., "Rosh [ha-Shanah, first day of the year] is not Sunday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''adu''}} is written by three [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] signifying Sunday, Wednesday and Friday). Accordingly, the first day of Passover is never Monday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo badu Pesah''}}" ({{lang|he|לא בד"ו פסח}}), which has a double meaning — "Passover is not a legend", but also "Passover is not Monday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''badu''}} is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Monday, Wednesday and Friday).

One reason for this rule is that [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar and the tenth day of the Hebrew year, now must never be adjacent to the weekly Sabbath (which is Saturday), i.e., it must never fall on Friday or Sunday, in order not to have two adjacent Sabbath days. However, Yom Kippur can still be on Saturday. These rules for the Feasts do not apply to the years from the Creation to the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses. It was at that time (cf. Exodus 13) that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gave the Hebrews their "Law" including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and Sabbaths.

Years consisting of 12 months have between 353 and 355 days. In a {{transl|he|''k'sidra''}} ("in order") 354-day year, months have alternating 30 and 29 day lengths. In a {{transl|he|''chaser''}} ("lacking") year, the month of [[Kislev]] is reduced to 29 days. In a {{transl|he|''malei''}} ("filled") year, the month of [[Marcheshvan]] is increased to 30 days. 13-month years follow the same pattern, with the addition of the 30-day Adar Alef, giving them between 383 and 385 days.

==Islamic calendar==
The observed and calculated versions of the [[Islamic calendar]] do not have regular leap days, even though both have lunar months containing 29 or 30 days, generally in alternating order. However, the [[tabular Islamic calendar]] used by Islamic astronomers during the Middle Ages and still used by some Muslims does have a regular leap day added to the last month of the lunar year in 11 years of a 30-year cycle.&lt;ref name=timeanddateIslamicCalendar&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.timeanddate.com/date/islam-leap-year.html | title = The Islamic leap year | date = n.d. | publisher = Time and Date AS | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This additional day is found at the end of the last month, Dhu 'l-Hijja, which is also the month of the [[Hajj]].&lt;ref name=GMANewsLeapYearTrivia&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/249829/lifestyle/people/leap-year-trivia-you-might-want-to-know | title = Leap year trivia you might want to know | date = n.d. | publisher = GMA News | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hijri-Shamsi calendar, also adopted by the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community, is based on solar calculations and is similar to the Gregorian calendar in its structure with the exception that the first year starts with [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/73.html | title=Hijri-Shamsi Calendar | publisher=Al Islam | date = 2015 | accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu calendar==
In the [[Hindu calendar]], which is a lunisolar calendar, the embolismic month is called ''adhika maas'' (extra month). It is the month in which the sun is in the same sign of the stellar zodiac on two consecutive dark moons. ''Adhika maas'' occurs once every 33 to 34 months, compensating for the approximately eleven fewer days per year in twelve lunar months than the solar calendar. Thus, Hindu festivals tend to occur within a given span of the Gregorian calendar. For example: the No Moon during [[Diwali]] festival occurs between mid - October and mid - November. [[Buddhist calendar]]s in several related forms (each a simplified version of the Hindu calendar) are used on mainland Southeast Asia in the countries of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thai lunar calendar|Thailand]], [[Myanmar (formerly Burma)]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

The Hindu Calendar also known as [[Vikram Samvat]] is used in [[Nepal]] as the national calendar. All the official work is done based on this calendar.

The calendar followed in some parts of [[South India]] (mainly in [[Tamil Nadu]]) is [[Solar calendar|solar]]. It has a leap year every four years.

==Bahá'í calendar==
{{main | Bahá'í calendar }}
The Bahá'í calendar is a solar calendar composed of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days). Years begin at Naw-Rúz, on the [[vernal equinox]], on or about March 21. A period of "Intercalary Days", called [[Ayyam-i-Ha]], are inserted before the 19th month. This period normally has 4 days, but an extra day is added when needed to ensure that the following year starts on the [[vernal equinox]]. This is calculated and known years in advance.

==Solar Hijri calendar==
{{main | Solar Hijri calendar }}
The [[Iranian calendar#Modern calendar (Solar Hejri)|Iranian calendar]] is an observational calendar that starts on the [[spring equinox]] and adds a single intercalated day to the last month (Esfand) once every four or five years; the first leap year occurs as the fifth year of the typical 33-year cycle and the remaining leap years occur every four years through the remainder of the 33-year cycle. The system used is more accurate and more complicated, and is based on the time of the March equinox as observed from [[Tehran]]. The 33-year period is not completely regular; every so often the 33-year cycle will be broken by a cycle of 29 years.

In Ireland and Britain, it is a [[tradition]] that women may [[Proposal of marriage|propose marriage]] only in leap years. While it has been claimed that the tradition was initiated by [[Saint Patrick]] or [[Brigid of Kildare]] in 5th century Ireland, this is dubious, as the tradition has not been attested before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Mikkelson |first1=B. | last2 = Mikkelson | first2 = D.P. | date = 2010 | url = http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/february29.asp | title = The Privilege of Ladies | website = The Urban Legends Reference Pages | publisher = snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, a 1288 law by Queen [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret of Scotland]] (then age five and living in Norway), required that fines be levied if a marriage proposal was refused by the man; compensation was deemed to be a pair of leather gloves, a single rose, £1 and a kiss.&lt;ref&gt;Virtually no laws of Margaret survive. Indeed, none concerning her subjects are recorded in the twelve volume ''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'' (1814–75) covering the period 1124–1707 (two laws concerning young Margaret herself are recorded on pages 424 &amp; 441–2 of volume I).&lt;/ref&gt; In some places the tradition was tightened to restricting female proposals to the modern leap day, February 29, or to the medieval (bissextile) leap day, February 24.

According to Felten: "A play from the turn of the 17th century, 'The Maydes Metamorphosis,' has it that 'this is leape year/women wear breeches.'

==Birthdays==
A person born on February 29 may be called a "leapling" or a "leaper".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | date =February 28, 2012 | article = February 29: 29 things you need to know about leap years and their extra day | title = Mirror | accessdate = December 7, 2015| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/leap-years-29-things-you-746716}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common years, they usually celebrate their [[birthday]]s on February 28. In some situations, March 1 is used as the birthday in a non-leap year, since it is the day following February 28.

Technically, a leapling will have fewer ''birthday anniversaries'' than their age in years. This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only: for example, in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st ''birthday'' (that is, when he turns 88 years old, since 1900 was not a leap year) rather than until his 21st ''year''.

For legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals.

[[File:Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the cancelled tour]]

'''Led Zeppelin – The 1980s, Part One''' was a planned autumn 1980 concert tour of North America by the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was scheduled to take place from 17 October through 15 November of that year and cover much of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The band cancelled the tour when drummer [[John Bonham]] died on 25 September, one day after the group's initial rehearsal for the tour.

==Background==
In the wake of Led Zeppelin's turmoil-plagued [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 American tour]], which ended abruptly with the sudden death of his son Karac, singer [[Robert Plant]] had become averse to touring America with the band. His reluctance to do so persisted despite the success of the ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' album and the band's return to the stage at the [[Knebworth Festival 1979|1979 Knebworth Festival]] after a two-year absence. Following the conclusion of Led Zeppelin's successful [[Tour Over Europe 1980]], however, Plant had a change of heart and informed Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] that he was willing to undertake an American tour with the band in the autumn of 1980. According to writer [[Mick Wall]], though,

{{cquote|Plant did, however, lay down some strict deal-breaker conditions: no tour should take him away from his family for longer than a month; the band would play a maximum of two shows back-to-back followed by a day off; and, as with the European tour, Superdomes were out, more modest venues in; the aim to re-establish 'contact' with the audience (and, by definition, themselves). Grant and the others wearily complied.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had been concerned about the band's lengthy absence from one of its primary markets, and had correctly viewed the European tour as a way of rekindling Plant's interest in performing in America.  Relieved by Plant's change of heart and mindful of the singer's conditions, Grant began planning a nineteen-date tour covering the American East Coast and Midwest, and envisioned Led Zeppelin undertaking additional West Coast and UK tours in early 1981. The band began preparations for the tour with renewed optimism about Led Zeppelin's future, with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] in particular commenting that the band had "new energy"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and was "almost in a rebirth situation."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; John Bonham's death, however, resulted in the scuttling of the band's touring plans, and ultimately in the demise of Led Zeppelin itself, with the breakup of the band officially announced on 4 December 1980.

While Jones's view of the state of Led Zeppelin on the eve of the 1980 North American tour was a positive one, writer [[Chris Welch]] saw things differently. In his biography of Peter Grant, Welch questioned the wisdom of the band undertaking a U.S. tour at that point in time:

{{cquote|It seems strange that Grant was quite so determined to get the band back to America, given all they had been through and the musicians' state of health. Was it just for the money? They already had an avalanche of income from record sales and publishing royalties. How many more cars, houses, farms, and antiques could they buy?&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Welch and writers Dave Lewis and Mick Wall particularly questioned John Bonham's physical and emotional fitness to tour North America at that stage. They note that by the fall of 1980 Bonham's dislike of touring, which had been steadily growing over the years, was virtually as strong as Plant's. He was particularly nervous about the potential backlash he might experience in the U.S. from his involvement in the backstage brawl at the Oakland Coliseum during Led Zeppelin's 1977 tour.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 219; Welch (2009), p. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bonham grew older, moreover, the demands of touring—along with the effects of his alcohol and drug use—took an increasing toll on his energy and stamina, and by 1980 he was struggling with fatigue. He had already permanently dropped his lengthy drum solos from the band's onstage performances.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2009), p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; While he came across to Lewis at the time as "delighted"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; about the upcoming trek, Bonham privately confided on the eve of the ill-fated rehearsals for ''Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One'' that he felt depressed and uneasy about going on tour, and that he felt his drumming was no longer up to scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly told Plant, "I've had it with playing drums. Everybody plays better than me. I'll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I'll sing." &lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; After that initial rehearsal on 24 September, he complained again about going on tour while engaging in a drinking binge that would prove to be fatal.

Ironically, on 25 September, at the same time the rest of the band and its entourage were learning of Bonham's death, thousands of Led Zeppelin fans in Chicago were eagerly obtaining copies of that day's ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' containing mail order applications for the upcoming November concerts. This proved to be fruitless since the tour was immediately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the concerts on this tour, the band intended to use a scaled-down approach similar to the one they used for the European tour, which entailed fewer lighting effects, less improvisation, and fewer extended solos than their 1970s concerts. The previously rehearsed but unperformed ''In Through the Out Door'' track "[[Carouselambra]]" was included in the tentative set-list.

*[[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)]] was sometimes referred to as "Fort Blunder", because the first version of the U.S. fort was inadvertently built on the Canadian side of the border.
* The [[NASA]] [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], launched in 1998, burned up in the Martian atmosphere. A mixup between metric and [[U.S. customary unit|US Standard]] measurements in the controlling software caused the spacecraft to miss its intended 140–150&amp;nbsp;km altitude above Mars during orbit insertion, instead entering the Martian atmosphere at about 57&amp;nbsp;km.
* The NASA [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]] mission was an attempt to sample particles from the solar wind. It successfully collected a sample and returned to Earth. However at the last moment the landing parachute failed to open and the return capsule smashed into the ground at high speed, contaminating the samples. The parachute failure was traced to an [[Genesis (spacecraft)#Mishap_Investigation_Board_(MIB)|accelerometer installed backwards]].

In [[journalism]], '''local news''' refers to coverage of events, by the [[news]], in a local context that would not be an interest of another locality, or otherwise be of national or international scope. Local news, in contrast to national or international news, caters to the news of their regional and local communities; they focus on more localized issues and events.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Local Journalism and Local Media : Making the Local News|last=Franklin|first=Bob|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/aul/detail.action?docID=240326|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key features of local newsrooms includes regional politics, business, and human interest stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Kelly M.|last2=Tang|first2=Tang|date=2015-10-02|title=#SocialJournalism: Local News Media on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|journal=International Journal on Media Management|volume=17|issue=4|pages=241–257|doi=10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|issn=1424-1277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local news readership has been declining in recent years, according to a recent study.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wadbring|first=Ingela|last2=Bergström|first2=Annika|date=2017-02-01|title=A Print Crisis or a Local Crisis?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175–190|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Opt-outs of local [[television news]] are frequent before, during, or after national evening news [[television program]]ming.  Often times, television networks can also commission or make provisions for their local stations to produce a longer standalone local news programmes.  In some cases, local television markets/viewing areas within a country may even have a dedicated 24-hour local news channel. Local news stations have also started covering less and less local politics in favor of stories that they believe will garner more clicks or attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study has also shown that there has also been less investigative journalism within local news stations in recent years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differences ===
Local news largely covers the following:
* local sports
* local crime and justice
* local weather
* local business and economy
* local events
* local education
* local politics
* local traffic updates (especially during morning newscasts)

National and international news, however, tend to cover a wider range of content, including news concerning specialized institutions of wide-ranging international power or influence, such as:
* (inter)national political and intergovernmental events
* stock markets
* (inter)national sports competitions
* regional environmental events
* media/entertainment events
* science/technology events
* air traffic/aviatory transport events
* defense/security events

=== Practices in each country ===
In the [[United States]], local news is provided on local [[commercial broadcasting]] channels (some of which are [[television network]] [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s).  They can either be standalone newscasts that run for at least a half-hour or short segments that air attached to national morning newscasts approximately 25 and 55 minutes past the hour.  As not all stations are owned and operated by a television network, the graphics, branding, and studio designs of a station's newscasts often differ from the network they are affiliated with although in recent years, affiliates have made some form of on-air reference to their corresponding networks in the branding of their newscasts.  In addition, the local news departments of stations also superimpose their on-screen digital clocks, thermometers, and (occasionally) local news tickers on graphics provided by networks during morning network newscasts.  Some cable channels are dedicated to local news coverage.  Examples of this include [[NY1]] in New York and [[NewsChannel 8 (cable channel)|NewsChannel 8]] in the Washington DC market.

In the [[United Kingdom]], most local news is provided on a local network station with similar branding and studio design to that of the national network news. Examples of this include the nationally networked [[BBC News]] and its regional news services such as [[BBC North West Tonight]] (on [[BBC North West]]) and [[BBC Newsline]] (on [[BBC Northern Ireland]]); the nationally networked [[ITV News]] and its regional stations including [[ITV Granada]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]].  The long version of BBC and ITV's local news shows often air during the 18:00 hour on weekday evenings.  STV, which simulcasts most of the ITV network's programmes in Scotland, is not owned and operated by ITV but has its own branded newscast that broadcasts Scottish-centred news at the same time as ITV's regional news services.

In France, most local news is aired on France Televisions' [[France 3]].  Additionally BFM TV also has a local news channel for the Ile-de-France region called BFM Paris.

Norway's public broadcaster, [[NRK1]], airs a local news programme called NRK Distriktsnyheter (name of viewing area) every weekday evening at 18:45 Central European Time, just before the main national newscast Dagsrevyen.  A replay of all local newscasts across the country is shown on NRK2 the following morning (Tuesday to Saturday).

In Sweden, SVT's regional news is simply called SVT Nyheter (name of viewing area) which shares the same branding as the network's main newscast, Rapport.  Unlike SVT's counterparts in the US and UK, during morning programmes, the local news opt-out airs in the middle of each half-hour.  Since June 2007, the morning regional cut-ins no longer feature an in-studio presenters but instead show compiled short reports from various correspondents across the region.  When SVT World was still airing, the simulcast of the morning programme featured a different regional opt-out during each half-hour.  A 13-minute standalone local newscast airs at 18:30 Central European Time each weekday evening after Sportnytt (SVT's sport news) on SVT1.  Additionally, a short local news segment is incorporated into SVT's other evening newscast Aktuellt which airs on SVT2.  In that case, this local news segment shares the same branding and graphics as Aktuellt.  There are no local SVT newscasts on Saturdays.

==Newspapers==
A lot of newspapers specialise in covering the cities they are based in.  Although paper copies of local newspapers are usually sold and circulated exclusively in the local areas they operate (with entities such as libraries or relatives wanting a copy of the paper where a family member is mentioned being mailed copies of outside of circulation areas), companies may make digital copies of their newspapers available to interested readers directly on their website or through services such as PressReader often with a paid subscription.

In the United States, although newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have a 'national' focus on their front pages, they still have dedicated sections for news in the areas they are based in.  Weather sections also highlight conditions in the local area and the sport sections feature local teams alongside national sport stories.  Their local editions also feature local classified ads.

==Local News in the Digital Age==
In the age of digital media, local news readership has started to fall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be attributed to the younger generation's disinterest in traditional news sources and the inability of news stations to fully integrate their business models and practices into the age of digital journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While national and international news industries began using Twitter as a way to break news and interact with their audiences, local news mediums have fallen behind, trending towards using Twitter as a secondary source for spreading information rather than a primary tool for audience engagement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since Internet sites reach a larger audience, more local news agencies have started their own websites to compete in the digital age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Websites are a great way for local news stations to produce more interactive content, which engages the audiences and increases readership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aside from the Internet, Twitter specifically has become a great way to engage the younger generation in news, gain more readership, and spread information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; National news sources have started using Twitter to quickly notify the public of breaking news and to interact with their readers, but local news have failed to integrate Twitter and other forms of social media into their journalism practices as successfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While local TV news stations have actually been a bit more effective with using social media, local newspapers have overall fallen behind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By engaging the audience and spreading important information, social media has been considered a solid method for strengthening the core standards of journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, social media like Twitter has become a vital tool for news agencies to incorporate into their everyday practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a result of the transition to digital content, local news agencies have had to change their business models. Although they previously gained revenue from subscriptions, more agencies have started making money from online advertising, but this only accounts for a small portion of revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This loss in revenue has been linked to a decline in local journalistic integrity, because with less profit, the need to make money through clickbait articles has become a necessity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Career==
===Con Funk Shun===
Louis A. McCall Sr. and singer/guitarist Michael Cooper formed Con Funk Shun as high school students in [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=saG0kc0lG7wC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=louis+mccall&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj47pbn-NLUAhWM7IMKHTO-Di04FBDoAQg0MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=louis%20mccall&amp;f=false African Americans in Vallejo – By Sharon McGriff-Payne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exxtrafoxxmusic.com/con_funk_shun/|title=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC – Con Funk Shun|work=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC|date=2007-2014|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding members Karl A. Fuller, Paul A. Harrell, Cedric A. Martin, [[Felton C. Pilate]] and Danny A. Thomas, the band started out as a backing group for the [[Soul Children]] under the name Project Soul. They began working with [[Stax Records]] staff songwriters, and while [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] at Audio Dimensions, a sound studio in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee, producer Ted Sturges both named the group (after an [[instrumental]] recording by [[The Nite-Liters]]) and produced their first album, ''Organized Con Funk Shun''.

In 1976, Con Funk Shun signed to [[Mercury Records]], releasing eleven albums over a span of ten years. The group's 1977 album, ''Secrets'', was certified [[gold album|gold]] in the U.S., as were ''Loveshine'' (1978), ''Candy'' (1979), and ''[[Spirit of Love]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Search for "Con Funk Shun" performed at [[RIAA]].com on December 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They scored a string of [[Top 40|top ten]] [[hit single|hits]] on the [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']] black singles [[record chart|chart]], including "Ffun" (#1 in 1977), "Shake and Dance with Me" (#5 in 1978), "Chase Me" (#4 in 1979), "Got to Be Enough" (#8 in 1980) and "Too Tight" (#8 in 1981). Tensions from within the group built over the 1980s, and the group's final album, ''Burning Love'', was recorded without songwriter and vocalist [[Felton Pilate]], who had left Con Funk Shun following a physical altercation involving McCall.&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; The band let McCall go after he missed two concert dates in order to deal with medical problems resulting from a teenage car crash.&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; After leaving Mercury Records, the band broke up in 1986, but some members of the group reunited alongside touring musicians for concerts in the 1990s.

===Later career===
After leaving Con Funk Shun in 1986, McCall joined forces with his wife, a music business consultant, and started an artist management company in the [[Washington, DC]] area. In 1989, they discovered [[Keith Martin (musician)|Keith Martin]], an aspiring R&amp;B artist, and signed on as his managers. When Linda Lou McCall was hired by rapper [[MC Hammer]] in 1990, the McCalls put Martin on Hammer's ''[[Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em]]'' tour as a backup musician and vocalist, which launched Martin's career in the music industry. In 1992, Linda Lou formed her own company, The Entertainment Qartel, Inc. (EQartel), specializing in music business administration and entertainment marketing and promotions.&lt;ref name=LindaLou&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exxtrafoxxmusic.com/linda_lou_mccall.html|title=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC – Linda Lou McCall CEO|work=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC|date=2007-2014|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to doing radio promotion for EQartel's Atlanta-based street team, the Rhyme Scene Unit, McCall also became a successful event planner, most notably producing a celebrity benefit for actor/activist [[Danny Glover]] at [[Fairmont San Francisco|The Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco]] in January 1993.

==Death and aftermath==
On June 25, 1997, Louis McCall was found murdered outside a friend's home in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]], the apparent victim of a home-invasion robbery.&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; His wife, Linda Lou, fought to keep the case active for eleven years, even asking the Governor of Georgia to assist in reopening the case in 2003. Finally, a suspect was indicted in 2007 in connection with the murder, but it took another year before the case made it to trial on July 21, 2008, with 29-year-old Marques Clair as defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simpson |first=David |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/07/21/mccall.html?cxntlid=inform_sr/ |title=Trial starts today in musician's '97 death |date=July 21, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525001311/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/07/21/mccall.html?cxntlid=inform_sr%2F |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clair was originally arrested with another suspect in McCall's slaying in 1999, but prosecutors had dropped the charge due to the District Attorney's refusal to bring the case before a jury with insufficient evidence.

Just two days after the start of Clair's murder trial, the proceedings were halted by Superior Court Judge Gregory Adams. A spokeswoman for the DeKalb County Georgia district attorney's office, Jada Hudspeth, stated that the suspension of the trial was "based on an omission" of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simpson |first=David |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/dekalb/stories/2008/07/24/slain_musician_mistrial.html |title=Mistrial declared in case of slain musician |date=July 24, 2008 |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604101702/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/dekalb/stories/2008/07/24/slain_musician_mistrial.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudspeth said that District Attorney, Gwen Keyes Fleming, and her staff would evaluate the evidence in the case before deciding whether to retry Clair. On August 7, 2008, after a mistrial was declared, the charges against Clair were formally [[dismissal with prejudice|dismissed with prejudice]].

==Legacy==
In recognition of the fact that Louis McCall was born in Alameda, CA, his name was chosen by the Alameda City Planning Board in April 2014 for naming one of the streets in the proposed residential community, Alameda Landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boitano |first=Dave |url=http://thealamedan.org/news/navy-loses-battle-over-street-names |title=Navy loses battle over street names |publisher=The Alamedan |date=April 29, 2014 |access-date=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2014, Louis McCall and the other six members of Con Funk Shun were honored by the National R&amp;B Music Society with a Lifetime Achievement Award at a black tie dinner and award ceremony in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnbmusicsociety.com/#!4th-black-tie-gala-award-cerem/c10cc The National R&amp;B Music Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823055009/http://www.rnbmusicsociety.com/#!4th-black-tie-gala-award-cerem/c10cc |date=August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same event, McCall's wife Linda Lou was presented with the "Unsung Heroine" award for her key role in the success of Con Funk Shun and her continued role in keeping the group's legacy alive, in addition to her tireless contribution to R&amp;B music for over four decades.&lt;ref name=LindaLou/&gt;

As well as being the band's leader, responsible for booking many of their most lucrative tours, Louis (along with Linda Lou) wrote several songs for Con Funk Shun, including "California 1", "Bad Lady", and "Honey Wild" (co-written with Con Funk Shun member Danny Thomas). In 2007, "Honey Wild", from the 1980 ''Spirit of Love'' album, was sampled by [[Lil Wayne]] for his Grammy Award-winning CD ''[[Tha Carter III]]''.

==Personal life==
In 1968, at the age of sixteen, McCall was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Vallejo, California.&lt;ref name="unsung"&gt;"Con Funk Shun."  ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]''. Exec. Prod. Frank Sinton, Arthur Smith, and Kent Weed. Co-Exec. Prod. Mark Rowland. Nar. Gary Anthony Williams. TV One, 9. Jul. 2012. Television.&lt;/ref&gt; He experienced medical problems in his adult life as a result of the accident.

Louis met his wife, the former Linda Lou Bolden from Washington, DC, in 1973, when both were working at Stax Records. The couple married on January 15, 1976, in a civil ceremony in [[San Francisco]], California. They had two children, Lindsay Chérie (born in 1979) and Louis Anthony II (born in 1982). McCall and his wife separated not long before his death,&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; but the pair remained close both personally and professionally.

McCall's first grandchild, Liam Richard Long, was born on March 2, 2014, to his daughter Lindsay, a [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] police officer, and her husband in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4392">{{short description|2016 hoax about marijuana cigarettes}}
{{tone|date=November 2018}}

The '''Marlboro M Hoax''' was a false rumor originating from satire news website ''Abril Uno'' on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abriluno.com/phillip-morris-introduces-marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=Phillip Morris Introduces ‘Marlboro M’ Marijuana Cigarettes|last=RapidxHTML|work=Abril Uno|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] joke.

== Hoax ==
The article claims that Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro tobacco company, is introducing a new line of marijuana cigarettes called Marlboro M in Colorado and the state of Washington. While fake, the article does have some factual basis, as tobacco companies have shown interest in marijuana since the 1970's.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BARRY|first=RACHEL ANN|last2=HIILAMO|first2=HEIKKI|last3=GLANTZ|first3=STANTON A.|date=2014-06|title=Waiting for the Opportune Moment: The Tobacco Industry and Marijuana Legalization|url=https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/waiting-for-the-opportune-moment-the-tobacco-industry-and-marijuana-legalization/|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en-US|volume=92|issue=2|pages=207–242|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12055|issn=0887-378X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article was quite obviously satire, it's intriguing title was able to make it around the internet before it could be disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=FACT CHECK: Has Phillip Morris Introduced 'Marlboro M' Marijuana Cigarettes?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/no-philip-morris-not-introduced-marlboro-m-cannabis-cigarette|title=False: Marlboro Marijuana Cigarettes from Phillip Morris {{!}} Leafly|date=2016-10-10|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, upon discovering that there were no 'Marlboro M' cigarettes at their local dispensary, claimed that they would be in stock by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Cannettes/comments/63jxuv/what_are_marijuana_cigarettes_called_cannettes/|title=r/Cannettes - What are Marijuana Cigarettes Called? (Cannettes)|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
While the article was proven fake, its claims were able gain widespread belief because of past and current events in cannabis culture,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} which themselves were true. For example, it is true that tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris, were interested in marijuana as a competing product and potentially an addition to their company, long before rapid legalization came about.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/big-tobacco-pot-weed-cannabis-industry-727407/|title=Big Tobacco Is Already Eyeing Pot|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=2018-09-25|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization is also a contributing factor to the blind acceptance these claims received, as societal views on marijuana use have largely shifted in recent years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marycarreon/2018/05/17/new-study-highlights-the-social-impacts-of-cannabis-legalization-in-california/#1836c73e2194|title=New Study Highlights The Social Impacts Of Cannabis Legalization In California|last=Carreon|first=Mary|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tobacco companies have actually began investing in medical marijuana research, as well as joining with marijuana seed investment firms, though they haven't gone as far is to introduce cannabis cigarettes into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/22/big-tobacco-makes-its-first-investment-in-the-mari.aspx|title=Big Tobacco Makes Its First Investment in the Marijuana Industry --  The Motley Fool|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2018-07-22|work=The Motley Fool|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it would be illegal for such a large company, such as Philip Morris, to introduce cannabis cigarettes, as its use is still illegal on the federal level (in the US).

Metro Broadcast is also the resident technical production supplier at several London event venues such as [[30 Euston Square]], a conference venue based at [[Royal College of General Practitioners|The Royal College of General Practitioners]], and one of Europe’s largest conference hotels, [[Hilton London Metropole]].  Metro’s production team also manages the https://www.youtube.com/yt/space/london/.   Additionally, the company is a preferred event supplier at some of London’s most precious and historic buildings including [[Somerset House]], [[Natural history museum|the Natural History Museum]], [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]], [[Worshipful Company of Barbers#Barber-Surgeons.27 Hall and Arms|Barber-Surgeons’ Hall]] and [[Middle Temple|Middle Temple Hall]].

==History==
In 1980, in a flat in [[Welling]], South East London, David Pacy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=20080325125433W2407&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director and Brian Rottger, Technical Director founded Metrovideo. Its principal activity was tape sales to advertising agencies such as [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] (formerly J. Walter Thompson Co.), [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] and [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] (formerly Young &amp; Rubicam).

The company soon relocated to Landsdown Road in Stockwell and then, in April 1984, to the Old Bacon Factory in Great Suffolk Street,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetimenow.com/united_kingdom/london/audio_visual_services-92/metrovideo_ltd-1492781&lt;/ref&gt; London SE1.

In early 1986, the business was sold to WPP plc, a British, multinational advertising and public relations company founded by [[Sir Martin Sorrell|Martin Sorrell]]. Metrovideo was the third company to be acquired by the Group.

Metrovideo later acquired a number of regional video businesses for itself including Horizon Video and Still Frame Video in the South of England and Teletape Anglia in [[Cambridge]]. This expanded the sales, installation, service, AV hire and technical event production&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incentivetravel.co.uk/news/venuesevents/22615-variety-hosts-an-evening-of-magic-at-vinopolis&lt;/ref&gt;| areas of the company. A broadcast division of the company was located in offices in London’s [[Soho]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/metro-to-expand-broadcast-arm/164686.article&lt;/ref&gt;   All of these businesses traded under the Metro Group banner.

In 1990, Metro launched a full-service production business called G Force which later changed its name to Clever Media.  Clever Media was then merged into another WPP operating company.

In 1997, the company extended its operation into [[Scotland]] by establishing an office and equipment warehouse in [[Edinburgh]].

In 2007 the Company was renamed as Metro Broadcast Ltd.   In 2012 Metro Broadcast relocated its head office and main business premises to its current location in Oval, South London.  In 2014 it acquired additional workshop space to house its set and staging department.  Today, the London business is led by Managing Director Mary Metcalfe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citmagazine.com/article/1294808/metro-broadcast-appoints-new-creative-lead&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish business is led by Managing Director Oscar Askin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventindustrynews.co.uk/brand-marketing/metro-ecosse-appointed-national-theatre-scotland-help-deliver-24-hour-live-streamed-event-theme-independence&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GRB080319B illustration NASA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gamma-ray bursts might have regulated the advent of intelligent life]]
'''Neocatastrophism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that life-exterminating events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s have acted as a galactic regulation mechanism in the [[Milky Way]] upon the emergence of complex [[life]] in its [[Galactic habitable zone|habitable zone]].&lt;ref name="Cirković08"&gt;Cirković MM, Vukotić B. (2008). Astrobiological phase transition: towards resolution of Fermi's paradox. 
Orig Life Evol Biosph. 38(6):535-47. {{DOI|10.1007/s11084-008-9149-y}} {{PMID|18855114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"&gt;Ćirković M.M. (2009). [http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1450-698X/2009/1450-698X0978001C.pdf  Fermi's paradox: The last challenge for copernicanism?] Serbian Astronomical Journal 178:1-20 {{doi|10.2298/SAJ0978001C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"&gt;Cirkovic, M. M. Vukotic, B. (2009). [http://www.aob.bg.ac.rs/paob/86/pdf/193-196.pdf Astrobiological Landscape and Neocatastrophism.]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Publications of the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade,86:193-19&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed as an explanation of [[Fermi paradox|Fermi's paradox]]  since it provides a mechanism which would have delayed the otherwise expected advent of [[Noogenesis|intelligent being]]s in the local galaxy nearby to [[Earth]]. This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected by [[humans]].

==The problem==

It is estimated that Earth-like [[planet]]s in the Milky Way started forming 9 billion years ago, and that their [[median]] age is 6.4 ± 0.7 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver C.H. (2001). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012399v2 An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect.] Icarus, 151:307-313 {{doi|10.1006/icar.2001.6607}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, 75% of stars in the [[galactic habitable zone]] are older than the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver CH, Fenner Y, Gibson BK. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401024 The galactic habitable zone and the age distribution of complex life in the Milky Way.] Science. 303(5654):59-62. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1092322}} {{PMID|14704421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ([[Age of the Earth|4.54 Ga]]). This creates an observational dilemma since [[interstellar travel]], (even of the "slow" kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology) could in theory, if this had arisen elsewhere, take from only 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, I.A., [http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326090244/http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, '' Scientific American,'' July 2000, 38-43, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] in his namesake paradox: "Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;Webb S. (2002). ''If the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody? Fifty solutions to the Fermi paradox and the problem of extraterrestrial life''. Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The neocatastrophism resolution==
The hypothesis posits that [[Astrobiology|astrobiological evolution]] is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology. These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the [[galactic habitable zone]]. The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts.&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt;

Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that [[stellar evolution]] produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the "window" in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age. According to modeling,&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt; this creates the possibility of a [[phase transition]] at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead (with a few pockets of simple life) to one that is crowded with complex life forms.

A '''news bureau''' is an office for gathering or distributing [[news]]. Similar terms are used for specialized bureaux, often to indicate geographic location or scope of coverage: a ‘Tokyo bureau’ refers to a given news operation's office in [[Tokyo]]; 'foreign bureau' is a generic term for a news office set up in a country other than the primary operations center; a ‘Washington bureau’ is an office, typically located in [[Washington, D.C.]], that covers news related to national politics in the [[United States]]. The person in charge of a news bureau is often called the bureau chief.

The term is distinct from a news desk, which refers to the editorial function of assigning reporters and other staff, and otherwise coordinating, news stories, and sometimes the physical desk where that occurs, but without regard to the geographic location or overall operation of the news organization.  For example, a foreign bureau is located in a foreign country and refers to all creative and administrative operations that take place there, whereas a foreign desk describes only editorial functions and may be located anywhere, possibly as an organizational unit within the news organization's home office.

==Operation of news bureaux==
A news bureau is traditionally operated out of an office by a single news outlet such as a radio, television, or newspaper news program.  A single news company such as [[CNN]] or [[NPR]] may use a single bureau and office staff for all of its programs, and even those of [[subsidiary]] or other affiliated companies.  For convenience, to save money and space, and to ensure the availability of necessary services (such as video feeds and studios), different companies may share an office space or co-locate at a single office building.  [[News agencies]] may also operate news bureaux, and major public relations sources (such as governments, large companies, or advocacy groups) may operate news bureaux of their own to create, rather than simply report, news stories.

==History of news bureaux==
&lt;!--
===Origin===
insert content here
--&gt;

===Decline===

Traditional [[news media]], particularly [[television news]] and [[newspapers]], have cut the number and size of news bureaux in recent decades for several reasons.  They face declining profitability due to increasing competition from Internet news sources, and therefore have less money to spend on news-gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-11-12|title=NBC Says Viewers Won’t Notice Cuts in News Staff|author=Jaques Steinberg|date=October 20, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/business/media/20nbc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers rely increasingly on cooperative arrangements with counterparts elsewhere, and often will accept stories from their sister organizations rather than investigating stories themselves.  Similarly, smaller newspapers may formally affiliate to sponsor cooperative bureaux that operate as [[press pool]]s to serve more than one news organization (and sometimes a large number of organizations) from a single office.  When news sources combine operations following a [[merger]] or other [[Consolidation (business)|business consolidation]], the surviving company often combines or eliminates redundant bureaux.  Growing [[multiculturalism]] has facilitated this process: rather than demanding a reporter from their own country or locale who has been sent on assignment, news audiences have come to tolerate or even expect to see stories in remote locations covered by people who live locally; this empowers the audience to make their own judgments about any apparent cultural difference between themselves and the news subjects, rather than leaving the function of cultural interpretation entirely up to the reporter.

The often-criticized practice of [[parachute journalism]] allows [[News media]] to cover stories remotely using journalists who are generalists rather than more specialized field experts.  Rather than leaving journalists in place waiting for breaking news to occur, smaller staff can be assigned as needed to wherever there are breaking stories, either by commuting to the physical location or by synthesizing reports from remote sources.  An even more controversial practice, sometimes described as a reaction to declining resources rather than a legitimate cost-saving measure, is to rely on and reprint information from [[press release]]s written by [[public relations]] professionals working for people or companies that are the subject of an article, or have an interest in an article, without spending the resources to verify or conduct independent research on the matter.  Another practice that limits news bureaux is [[embedded reporter|embedded reporting]], whereby [[war correspondent]]s travel under the care of military units rather than at their own direction.  The ability to quickly and safely travel throughout a war zone, and to obtain interviews with soldiers and coverage of important conflicts, appeals to news media, but at the cost of journalistic independence and, according to some, objectivity.

==Nontraditional bureaux==

The interaction between professional journalists, witnesses, and news subjects has evolved considerably.  Whereas news subjects and bystanders were once treated simply as [[witnesses]] to be interviewed for a [[news story]], media have now accepted them as part of the news process.  There are many antecedents to [[Citizen journalism]].  For example, meteorologists would count on amateurs to gather weather data to report, or interview willing subjects unrelated to a news story for "[[man on the street]]" interviews.  As early as the 1930s the [[Soviet Union]] encouraged millions of amateur [[People's correspondent]]s to expose corruption and otherwise report on news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=Moscow Times|date= July 3, 2006|title=Proletarian Bloggers Celebrate a Milestone|author=Carl Schreck|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/07/03/002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, media, unable to respond quickly enough to obtain compelling coverage of natural disasters and weather phenomena such as [[tornadoes]] would count on hobbyists for photographs and film footage.  With improvements in technology and as [[video camera]]s and [[Videophone|video-equipped cell phone]]s became widely available, they set up formal programs to gather material from nonprofessionals.  For example, in August, 2006, [[CNN]] launched "CNN Exchange", by which the public is encouraged to submit "I-Reports" comprising photographs, videos, or news accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=C/Net|title=CNN snatching page out of YouTube's book|author=Greg Sandoval|date=July 30, 2006|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1025-6100139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel|accessdate=2007-11-14|title=CNN welcoming citizen journalists|author=Scott Leith|date=August 1, 2006|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=478319}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently newspapers have incorporated [[blogs]], once seen as a threat to conventional news practice, either by creating blogs of their own (and deputizing local or field-specific bloggers as a second, lower-paid tier among their recognized staff of [[independent contractor]]s) or by covering blogs as news sources.

In 2006 [[Reuters]] opened its first virtual news Bureau, staffing real-life reporters in a virtual office in [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=USA Today|title=Reuters opens virtual news bureau in 'Second Life'|date=October 10, 2006|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-10-16-reuters-second-life_x.htm?POE=TECISVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] followed suit in October 2007, but took a citizen journalism approach, allowing residents of Second Life to submit their own reportage.&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14 |publisher=Media Week |title=CNN To Launch Bureau in Second Life Virtual World |author=Mike Shields |date=October 29, 2007 |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031060212/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archivedate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the news audience of Second World is relatively small, and declining, media consider it a training ground for themselves and participants, applicable to future virtual news projects.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt;

'''Old Home Week''' or '''Old Home Day''' is a practice that originated in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]] similar to a harvest holiday or festival.  In its beginning in the 19th–20th century it involved a municipal effort to invite former residents of a village, town, or city—usually individuals who grew up in the municipality as children and moved elsewhere in adulthood—to visit the "Old Home", the parental household and home town. Some municipalities celebrate the holiday annually, while others celebrate it every few years.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, the practice has spread to other parts of [[North America]] and has become a broader celebration with an emphasis on local culture and history. From the [[Wilmington, Vermont]] town web site:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Town of Wilmington | authorlink = Wilmington, Vermont | title = Old Home Week 2010 | url = http://www.wilmingtonvermont.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B7F6E5A89-A189-4E95-8300-50B76E0DC660%7D | accessdate = 2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Old Home Week is a town event held every 10 years. It is best described as a town reunion, a celebration of Wilmington's citizens, past, present and future, and a honoring of its history. Events traditionally include a parade, a town dinner, class and family reunions and tours of local points of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…Old Home Week is a decennial celebration and gathering of friends and acquaintances, all sharing the common experience of having resided and/or attended school, in Wilmington. It is also a celebration for all those who now live in and love their town.  Nobody is an outsider during Old Home Week.|40px|40px}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47915">''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' is an online team-based [[first person shooter]] developed by [[Blizzard Entertainment]], and released worldwide in May 2016. Normally played in matches of six-vs-six, players select from one of [[Characters of Overwatch|29 heroes]], broadly classified into the three categories of Tank, Damage, and Support, and work with their team to attack or defend map objectives. Each hero has a unique set of weapons, abilities, and skills, which players can coordinate to overpower the other team. ''Overwatch'' supports both casual and ranked matchmaking, as well as a rotating set of arcade modes, and the game has since become a popular [[eSport]], featuring a professional [[Overwatch League]] that started in 2018. The game has been both a critical and financial success for Blizzard, exceeding over 30 million players and obtaining over $1 billion in revenue within its first year.

To support ongoing interest in the game, Blizzard has run several seasonal events, typically coinciding with worldwide events and holidays. These events last for two to three weeks, updating [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to incorporate elements of that theme, and provide new game modes along with the opportunity to acquire unique cosmetic options. Players keep their earned character cosmetic options after the event ends, but the rest of the themed elements return to normal.

== Overview ==
Over the course of developing ''Overwatch'', Blizzard opted against using a [[downloadable content]] model to extend the game and bring post-sale revenues, as they had developed the game around the mechanic of allowing players to switch out to new heroes during the course of a match as to meet current strategic conditions; by requiring players to purchase new heroes, such a model would have hampered this approach.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: Development"/&gt; Instead, they opted to include [[microtransaction]]s through which players can buy [[loot box]]es, which contain four randomized cosmetic items, including characters skins, victory poses, emotes, spray tags, highlight introductions, and player icons. This allowed them to create an incentivized [[experience level|level progression system]] that would reward players with a loot box for every level they earned from experience gained in playing matches.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Progression"/&gt; Working alongside this, players can earn in-game coins through some loot box rewards or as a consolation prize for receiving a duplicate loot box reward. These coins can be used to purchase any of the available cosmetic items (with the exception of player icons), the cost reflecting the rarity of obtaining the item through a loot box.

Beginning in August 2016, Blizzard began introducing seasonal events, starting with the Summer Games event which corresponded with the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. ''Overwatch''{{'}}s director Jeff Kaplan said the goal of these seasonal events was to make the game "feel alive", correlating with real-world events.&lt;ref name="VG247: Seasonal"/&gt; The company has a history of creating in-game seasonal events, such as the Valentine's Day and New Year's events in ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Other competitor games, such as ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'' and ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', also implement in-game seasonal events.&lt;ref name="IGN: more"/&gt;

Events have generally included at least one new game mode, which typically is only available to play while that event is active; one exception is the "Capture the Flag" mode introduced during the Chinese New Year event in early 2017, which has been brought back to the game as a permanent feature in the game's casual Arcade matchmaking mode. Players are typically rewarded with loot boxes for playing matches in these seasonal game modes, and the game offers unique [[achievement (video gaming)|achievements]] and associated cosmetic rewards for completing certain goals within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/173914/overwatch-uprising-achievements-how-to-unlock-all-the-new-event-sprays#.m0kj9F4sw|title=How to unlock all the new 'Overwatch' sprays during the Uprising event|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to new games modes, these seasonal events include unique cosmetic items that can be obtained primarily during the event. Blizzard develops a large amount of content for these events, not all which ends up available to players.&lt;ref name="USGamer: Events 2017"/&gt; Initially, these items could only be obtained through event-themed loot boxes that are guaranteed to contain at least one event-themed item, which could either be earned through leveling up, completing the event game modes, or through microtransactions;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer"/&gt; however, in response to player feedback and avoid an apparent [[paywall]] access to these items, Blizzard allowed players to purchase these items with in-game currency at a higher cost than a non-event item of the same rarity, starting from the second seasonal event onward.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer Problem"/&gt; When the event is completed, the themed loot boxes and cosmetic items are no longer are available until the event is run again. However, players retain and can use all unique event items they have earned after the event.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; Not all event items will be limited in this manner, as Blizzard plans to have certain event items be possible loot obtained from a regular loot box in the future.&lt;ref name="Kotatu: Special Skins to Regular Loot"/&gt;

Several seasonal events, such as Summer Games, Halloween Terror, and Winter Wonderland, have recurred. However, on bringing these events back, the development team has added new changes to the event to keep them fresh and to reflect any new heroes or other content added to the game since the previous event's occurrence; for example, the 2017 Halloween "Junkenstein's Revenge" included a new endless mode and support for some of the newer heroes.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Returning Seasonal"/&gt; Recurring events also feature new themed cosmetic items for these recurring events, along with the return of the previous cosmetics which can be found in the event loot boxes or bought for a reduced coin amount.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; Not all seasonal events are designed for recurrence, such as the lore-heavy "Uprising" event which took place in April 2017. Kaplan said that Blizzard has plans as to how these events will evolve in the future.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2016 events ==
=== Summer Games ===

In August 2016, Blizzard released its first seasonal event in celebration of the concurrent [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. Both Blizzard's "Summer Games" and the Olympics ran throughout the month. Summer Games added 100 new cosmetic character options and a new game mode, Lúcioball.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;

Lúcioball was designed as a futuristic [[soccer]] game in which two teams of three Lúcio characters attempt to push a ball into their opponents' goal. Played in four-minute matches on the special stadium map, Estádio das Rãs, players use two kinds of attacks to control the ball's movements: primarily, a melee attack and a secondary, powerful sonic boom that could knock back opponents as well (frequently called "booping" by players). Players can also use the level's environmental perks (e.g., jump pads and speed-boosting walls) to secure strategic advantage on the field.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' felt that the mode felt closer to a "multiplayer carnival game than a fleshed-out, standalone mode".&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror ===

Blizzard released its second seasonal event for [[Halloween]], which lasted throughout the month of October 2016. It included over 100 new cosmetic items (in [[jack-o'-lantern]]-themed loot boxes) and the game's first [[player versus environment|game mode against computer players]], Junkenstein's Revenge.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt; Several characters received new Halloween-themed cosmetic skins. ''PC Gamer'' wrote that they were among the game's best add-ons,&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt; and ''[[Kill Screen]]'' felt the new character skins were much more enjoyable compared to those offered for the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="Kill Screen: Halloween"/&gt; Players could now purchase the seasonal add-ons with in-game credits (at a premium), in response to criticism Blizzard received from players during the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt;

In Junkenstein's Revenge, four players [[co-op video game|cooperatively]] guard a castle door from oncoming waves of enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. Set in a themed section of the game's Eichenwalde map, players select a [[difficulty level]] and choose between the characters [[Ana (Overwatch)|Ana]], [[Hanzo (Overwatch)|Hanzo]], [[McCree (Overwatch)|McCree]], and [[Soldier:_76]], before fighting off approaching mindless "zomnic" drones, long-range "zombardiers," exploding tires, and costumed versions of the characters [[Reaper (Overwatch)|Reaper]], [[Roadhog (Overwatch)|Roadhog]], [[Symmetra (Overwatch)|Symmetra]], [[Mercy (Overwatch)|Mercy]], and [[Junkrat]] (as the titular Dr. Junkenstein).&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; The game mode includes new voice work and is based on a companion comic book released concurrently.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

The new mode was generally praised by commentators. ''[[PC Gamer]]'' wrote that the event resembled a similar event run on the team shooter ''Team Fortress 2'' since 2012. Though the reviewer found the Junkenstein mode pleasant, he wrote that in comparison to ''Team Fortress 2''{{'s}} [[Mann vs. Machine]] mode, Junkenstein felt "shallow" and similar to Lúcioball in its simplistic map flow, giving little room for player movement. He also wondered why the mode was limited to four specific characters.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Robert Purchase found the event fun and considered it a good distraction from ''Overwatch''{{'}}s main modes, but also recognized that if it was kept on after the Halloween Terror event, it would become a stale game mode.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Halloween"/&gt; Heather Alexandra for  ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the mode demonstrated that a co-operative player-versus-environment mode would fit well as a permanent feature within ''Overwatch'' as it required good team coordination to complete more challenging matches.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween"/&gt;

The event ended a few hours earlier than had been planned, leaving some players upset as they were waiting for as long as possible collecting the themed loot boxes in-game before trying to spend in-game coins or purchasing loot boxes to get the cosmetic items they were missing.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween early end"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland ===
The holiday-themed Winter Wonderland event ran for the latter half of December 2016 through the first days of the new year. Like previous events, it added over 100 themed cosmetic items for players to obtain via loot boxes or in-game currency, as well as provided snowy versions of two of the game's maps.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; One cosmetic items included the first Legendary skin for Mei since the game's release, a Santa-like outfit; with this skin equipped, it also changed the appearance of Mei's Cryo-Freeze from a simple block of ice to a frozen snowman.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Players criticized the skin, feeling that it did not vary as much from Mei's normal outfits and appeared to be a simple recoloring of her default skin, in comparison to what other characters' Legendary skins had been.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Blizzard admitted that their "'cool meter' was off" when they designed this skin, believing that players would take to the Cryo-Freeze effect as a reason to value the skin. Blizzard stated that they had plans for another Mei Legendary skin, along the lines of what players would expect, in early 2017.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei Response"/&gt;

The event featured a new [[deathmatch]] mode called "Mei's Snowball Offensive". The mode took place on the smaller Ecopoint: Antartica map, introduced in the previous months for standard deathmatch play. Six players each play Mei, but where her Endothermic Blaster, which normally fires a stream of damaging cold, can only fire a single snowball. Players must find a snowball pile scattered around the map to reload the weapon. Further, her Ultimate ability allows her to fire a machine-gun-like string of snowballs for a brief period. Otherwise, Mei's other abilities (Ice Wall and Cyro-Freeze) remain the same. A single snowball hit kills the struck until the round is complete.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; Kotaku claims this mode was generally not well received by players as the act of having to reload the Blaster made one too vulnerable, and with the [[permadeath]] mechanic in play, the mode was not fun nor captured the spirit of a snowball fight.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter"/&gt;

== 2017 events ==
=== Year of the Rooster ===
A [[Chinese New Year]]-themed event launched a few days before the actual holiday on January 28, 2017, and centered on celebrating the Year of the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]]. As with past events, the Chinese New Year event introduced over 100 new cosmetic items, including the promised new Legendary skin for Mei to make up for the poorly-received one she had gotten during the Winter Wonderland event.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY"/&gt; Other skins for Roadhog, Reinhardt, Winston and Zenyatta alluded to the Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Leak"/&gt;

The event introduced the first [[Capture the Flag]] mode for ''Overwatch'' called "Capture the Rooster"; Blizzard had looked at adding such a mode for a few years during ''Overwatch''{{'}}s development but had difficulty with the mechanics due to the vastly different set of abilities offered by the characters that could imbalance the mode towards fast-moving characters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF"/&gt; Played on the Lijiang Tower map, normally used for Control modes, each team has a flag near their base. To capture the other opponent's flag, a character must stay near the flag and not take damage for a few seconds. Once they have taken the flag, they then must return it to their team's base, scoring a point if they do so. If they die while bringing the flag back, either a teammate can try to capture it, or the opposing team must stay near the flag, avoiding taking damage for a few seconds, to return it to their base. Teams can score with the opposing team's flag even if their team's flag has been taken. The first team to three scores, or the team with the highest score after five minutes, wins the match.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Start"/&gt;

Following the event, Blizzard introduced a more general Capture the Flag mode, playable on any of the Control maps, into the Arcade modes as well as making it an option for custom games with several adjustable parameters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF added"/&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Uprising ===
Uprising ran for most of the month of April 2017, and was the first seasonal event not tied to any real-world event, but instead used to expand the lore of ''Overwatch''. The story centered around one of the last official missions of the Overwatch team before they were disbanded—having to end the threat of a hostile Omnic force known as the Null Sector in its attack on the citizens of London—; which also happened to be [[Tracer (Overwatch)|Tracer]]'s first mission. Over 100 new cosmetic items were added with this event, many based on the uniforms and backstory of the original Overwatch forces.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt; A digital comic retelling this story was released alongside the event.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt; According to Kaplan, the Uprising event was something Blizzard felt had been asked for by players since they started offering the seasonal events. Players had requested non-holiday-themed events, as well as sought more details on the setting and history of the ''Overwatch'' world.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt;

The event added a new cooperative player-versus-environment mode called "Uprising", played on the King's Row map set in London. In the standard mode, which can be played at one of four difficulty levels, four players select from the characters of Tracer, [[Reinhardt (Overwatch)|Reinhardt]], [[Torbjörn (Overwatch)|Torbjörn]], and Mercy. From there, the players are directed by in-game narration to take several control points while fighting against waves of Null Sector Omnics that try to stop them. Eventually, they must then escort an explosive weapon to a sealed door in order to access the heart of the Null Sector facility and end their threat for good. If a player was downed, any of the other still-surviving players could help them up by interacting with that character for a few moments (or through Mercy's Ultimate ability of Resurrection). If all four players are downed, or the explosive is destroyed before reaching the sealed doors, the round ends as a loss.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising"/&gt;  A separate mode allowed players to complete the same mission without being limited in character selection, but without any of the character-specific dialogue; Blizzard added this based on feedback from Junkenstein's Revenge, so as to provide a less restrictive way to enjoy the game mode.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising"/&gt;

The Uprising mode was considered a much-improved version of a player-versus-environment mode compared to Junkenstein's Revenge from the Halloween event. Cecilia D'Anastasio for ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt the mode was much more dynamic since it required players to move throughout the map rather than stay in one general location, and as the four default characters represent a balanced team, the mode calls for more careful teamwork and strategy. D'Anastasio also felt that with new voice lines to support this mode, it helped to establish the game's lore for players.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising Review"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' argued that the Uprising event demonstrated the potential for a strong team-based story-driven campaign developed within the ''Overwatch'' narrative.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising Review"/&gt;

The event had mistakenly ended a few hours earlier than expected on May 1, 2017; Blizzard apologized and extended the event for an additional day into May 2 to allow players to finish acquiring and purchasing the event loot boxes and skins.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising Ended"/&gt;

While the event was just named "Uprising" at its release, Blizzard stated in 2018 that they considered it to be the first "''Overwatch'' Archive" annual event that will be used to explore the history of the characters and narrative.&lt;ref name="polygon archives"/&gt;

=== Anniversary ===
The Anniversary event, ran from the end of May 2017, celebrated ''Overwatch''{{'}}s first year since release. Gameplay-wise, it added three new Arena maps used for the smaller-scale Elimination games, and which will remain in rotation after the events' conclusion. The Eliminate mode also received two variants. In one-on-one "Limited Duel" matches, each player is presented with the same selection of three random heroes for play for that round. In three-on-three "Lockout Elimination", the heroes used by the winning team on a round are locked out for the next round.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt;

In addition, over one hundred new cosmetic items are available, including new dancing emotes for each of the characters.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt; The dance emotes were found to evoke references to popularized dance moves in other works, such as Mei's dance being similar to the "Hare Hare Yukai" dance used at the end credits for the anime ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance 2"/&gt;

=== Summer Games 2017 ===
A second Summer Games event was held from August 8 to August 29, 2017.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt; This event brought back the 3-on-3 soccer-like mode, Lucioball, introduced from the first Summer Games, adding additional arenas for the event to be played in, but removing the ability to "boop" other players.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; In addition to casual matchmaking for Lucioball, Blizzard also introduced a ranked play system for Lucioball, separate from the game's normal Competitive mode. By participating in this "Copa Lucioball" mode, players earned Competitive Points (CP), the same in-game currency earned playing Competitive matches, and used towards purchasing special weapon skins (such as golden weapons).&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

The previous skins and other cosmetic items offered from the first Summer Games were made available again to obtain in loot crates or purchasable from in-game coins at a lower cost, while additional Summer Games skins were added, purchasable at their normal cost.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2017 ===
The Halloween Terror 2017 event ran from October 10 to November 2, 2017. The event brought back "Junkenstein's Revenge" from the previous year's event, but added an endless-mode variant that challenges players to defend the door through as many waves as possible. This mode allowed players to have four additional characters to select from, Genji, Torbjorn, Widowmaker, and Zenyatta, in addition to McCree, Soldier: 76, Ana, and Hanzo. Teams lasting the longest were tracked via an online scoreboard.&lt;ref name="VG247: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

New skins and cosmetic items were added to the event, along with the items from the previous Halloween Terror. With the exclusion of the tombstone victory poses introduced in the previous event, all these could be obtained from loot boxes or in-game coin purchase. Blizzard opted to remove the tombstone victory poses from loot box rewards as they believed these no longer fit with the characters' personalities, but still allowed players to purchase them in-game.&lt;ref name="Dot Esports: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland 2017 ===
The winter-focused "Winter Wonderland 2017" event ran from December 12, 2017 through January 1, 2018. It brought back the previous year's "Winter Wonderland" content, including the "Mei Snowball Offensive" mode and previous cosmetic items, along with new skins and other cosmetics. It also added a new Arcade mode, "Yeti Hunter". In this [[asymmetric gameplay|asymmetric mode]], five players, each playing as [[Mei (Overwatch)|Mei]], attempt to defeat one player controlling [[Winston (Overwatch)|Winston]] (acting as the Yeti) in a boss battle on Nepal's Village stage. Yeti Hunt is the first Overwatch mode to use role selection; players can indicate their preference to play as a Mei or as the Yeti. The Winston player must elude the Mei team, which can freeze him, use ice walls to impede his movement, or catch him in a snare trap (which replaces Mei's usual Ultimate). After collecting four pieces of meat, which spawn randomly in predetermined locations around the map, Winston unleashes his Ultimate ability for a short period which temporarily boosts his health, reduces his jump cooldown, and gives him powerful melee attacks. When a Mei player dies, they will respawn after a short delay and cost their team a life. The match is over once the Mei team either defeats Winston or loses all five of their lives.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter 2017"/&gt; Kaplan described the Yeti Hunt as a light-hearted mode to be played for a few matches rather than hundreds of hours.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2018 events ==
=== Year of the Dog ===
The Chinese New Year event reoccurred from February 8 to March 5, 2018, now reflecting the Year of the [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]].&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/lunar-new-year-seasonal-event-returns-to-overwatch-next-week-w516267 | title = Lunar New Year Seasonal Event Returns to 'Overwatch' Next Week | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = February 1, 2018 | accessdate = February 1, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; New cosmetic items relating to the theme were released, in addition to the existing cosmetics from the previous event. A new map, "Ayutthaya", inspired by [[Thailand]] and specifically designed for the Capture the Flag mode, was introduced in this event. Additionally, new Capture the Flag rules for all modes were updated, replacing the potential to have these end as draws by instead playing tie-breaking rounds with the teams' flags starting closer to each other on each subsequent round. The changes also eliminated the short period before players could pick up the flag, now able to pick up the flag instantaneously, but any use of a character's active skills or ultimate abilities that provide mobility or invulnerability would force them to drop the flag, and render the flag unable to be picked up for a few moments. These changes were to make games feel "much more offensive, and much more action-packed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/this-week-s-year-of-the-dog-event-in-overwatch-will-bring-a-new-map-486573.phtml | title = This week's Year of the Dog event in Overwatch will bring a new map | first = Jordan | last = Devore | date = February 6, 2018 | accessdate = February 6, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a competitive mode for Capture the Flag, following a similar format as the competitive Lucioball mode in the 2017 Summer Games event, was run during the event, rewarding players with Competitive Points and unique items for the end-of-event placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/overwatch-celebrates-lunar-new-year-with-new-map-w516551 | title = 'Overwatch' Celebrates Lunar New Year With New Map and Capture The Flag Mode | first = Blake | last= Hester | date = February 9, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the event, Blizzard featured its inaugural "Puppy Rumble", modeled after the ''[[Puppy Bowl]]'', on February 19, 2018, featuring puppies dressed in ''Overwatch'' character outfits in mock events. All of the animals during the event were put up for adoption through the event's co-sponsor [[Petfinder]], as well as promoting animal adoption through other local adoption agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/the-overwatch-puppy-rumble-celebrates-the-year-of-the-dog-with-real-dogs/ | title = The Overwatch 'Puppy Rumble' celebrates the Year of the Dog with real dogs | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = February 19, 2018 | accessdate = February 19, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Retribution ===
The ''Overwatch'' Archive event from the previous year returned, and ran from April 10, 2018. It brought back the narrative-driven player-versus-environment mode introduced in Uprising. It also featured a new mode titled "Retribution", which will take place on a new map, Rialto, which entered the game's map rotation as a Payload map outside of the Retribution event, on May 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-map-rialto-is-launching-this-week-f/1100-6458660/ | title = Overwatch's New Map, Rialto, Is Launching This Week For Everyone | first =Eddie | last = Makuch | date = May 1, 2018 | accessdate = May 1, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a four-player co-operative mode, based on the characters Reaper, McCree, Moira, and Genji as they escape from Talon forces; alternatively, this mode also includes an All-Hero mode where players can select any of the available characters. New skins and cosmetic items were available in loot boxes during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/29/17176928/overwatch-uprising-event-start-date-2018 | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns in April | first = Allegra | last=  Frank  |date = March 29, 2018 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon archives"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17189214/overwatch-archives-retribution-uprising-event | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns as Overwatch Archives | first=  Ryan | last = Gilliam | date = April 2, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/4/4/17193808/overwatch-archives-retribution-trailer-reveal-pve | title = Overwatch Archives: Retribution is this year’s Blackwatch PVE brawl | first=  Ryan | last = Gillian | date = April 4, 2018 | accessdate =April 4, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Retribution event was aimed to provide a more replayable experience compared to the prior Uprising event. This included eliminating the waypoint approach they as to reduce elements on the user interface and instead allow players to naturally figure out how to progress in the mission. They also included "specials", unique enemies with special abilities to pose an immediate threat to the players rather than just waves of strong enemies, and included an enemy [[artificial intelligence]] systems to better react to players, including in the All-Hero mode. Much of the ideas of this mode were based on concepts from the ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-retribution-development-heroes-specials-hanzo | title = Left 4 Dead was "a huge inspiration" for Overwatch Retribution | first = Matt | last=  Purslow | date = April 12, 2018 | accessdate = April 12, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anniversary 2018 ===
The second anniversary event ran from May 22 to June 11, 2018. Also with new cosmetic items, the event included a limited time competitive [[deathmatch]] mode with an exclusive map, Petra. In addition to previous Anniversary cosmetic items, all Anniversary loot boxes included cosmetic items from all previous seasonal events, and these are also available to buy with in-game gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/5/14/17348534/overwatch-second-anniversary-event-cosmetics-deathmatch-details | title = Overwatch’s second anniversary event starts May 22 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date =  May 15, 2018 | accessdate = May 15, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-overwatch-skins-and-more-out-now-with-annivers/1100-6459128/ | title = New Overwatch Skins And More Out Now With Anniversary Event | first=  Patrick | last=  Faller | date = May 24, 2018 | accessdate = May 24, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summer Games 2018 ===
The third Summer Games event ran from August 9–30, 2018. The Lucioball event returned with a new stadium map based on [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/8/2/17646222/overwatch-summer-games-2018-august-9th | title= Overwatch’s Summer Games return August 9th | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = August 2, 2018 | accessdate = August 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2018 ===
The 2018 iteration of Halloween terror ran from October 10–31, 2018. The Dr. Junkenstein's Revenge mode was updated to include changes made throughout the previous year, such as the changes to Symmetra. The player-versus-environment map remained largely unchanged, with the 2 modes and 4 difficulties each of the last year's event. Brigitte and Tracer were made playable for the game mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/10/1/17922306/overwatch-halloween-terror-2018-event-date | title = Halloween Terror returns to Overwatch on October 9 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = October 1, 2018 | accessdate = October 1, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rene Peter Onno Rubiono van Helsdingen''' (born 25 February 1957)&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC"&gt;{{cite web|last = Helsdingen|first = Rene|url = http://www.renevanhelsdingen.com/biography.html|title = Rene van Helsdingen biography|publisher = |date = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch pianist and composer. 

He studied classical music with Komter Loeber in [[Blaricum]] in the Netherlands from 1962–72. Then he studied jazz music with [[Terry Trotter]] and Lazlo Cser in Los Angeles in 1979. His earliest influences include [[Oscar Peterson]], [[McCoy Tyner]] and [[Bill Evans]]. 

Over the years pianist René has recorded and produced for many different labels, such as Virgin, Timeless, WEA, Dureco,  Zebra Acoustic, Pacific Music, Turning Point records, Munich Records, demajors Independent Music Industry Jakarta and his own labels: Relukreul records, and Helsdingen Music, The Netherlands. Helsdingen writes most of his repertoire.  Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' characterised him as "A rewarding pianist who can play comfortably in the groove, or create more impressionistic patterns, or quiet, subtle musings. Perhaps the most notable quality of his solos is brevity.

'''The Oprah Effect''' is the phenomenon in which consuming [[soft news]] causes the politically unaware to vote more consistently with their own views, articulated by Matthew A. Baum and Angela S. Jamison in their 2006 study, "''The Oprah Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/mbaum/documents/OprahEffect_JOP.pdf|author=Matthew Baum and Angels Jamison|title=The ''Oprah'' Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently|publisher=The Journal of Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings and conclusions of the study centered around the distinction between hard and soft news as written about by Baum, and the complex interactions both types of news have on people with low and high political awareness. The term was pioneered by [[Oprah Winfrey]].

The increase of soft news content available has led some scholars to question its value in informing the public, and therefore question whether the media is properly fulfilling its duty to inform the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas|title=The Search for a Standard: Markets and the Media|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20|pages=139–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeller|first1=John|title=A New Standard of News Quality: Burglar Alarms for the Monitorial Citizen|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oprah Effect was demonstrated by testing a dependent variable of voting consistently versus an independent variable which measured how often the voter watched daytime talk shows. Voting consistency measures the consistency between a voter's preferences and their vote. For the context of this experiment, the measure of voting consistently was created by applying Lau and Redlawsk's model of "correct" voting to data from the 2000 [[American National Election Studies|National Election Studies]]. Increased consumption of soft news caused low information voters to vote more consistently, but had no significant effect on more aware voters. Exposure to hard news modestly increased the voting consistency of politically aware individuals, but had no significant effect on those with low political awareness.

While Baum and Jamison agree that soft news contains lower quality political information, they conclude from their analysis that soft news fulfills a valuable duty by providing information to apolitical individuals. This is because soft news still exposes those individuals to the political information that they need to cast a vote for the candidate which best reflects their personal interests, even if it doesn't contain highly complex political information. They theorize that exposure to soft news has this effect on low information individuals because most people with little political knowledge have no interest in harder news, making their decision to consume soft news one between  consuming soft news or consuming no news. Even though soft news may not be highly informational, it's still beneficial compared to consuming no news. They also go even further, contending that even if an individual with little political knowledge were to consume hard news, the more complex political information would be difficult for them to comprehend, and they would get relatively little out of it. As a result, they conclude their results should give some pause to critics of the increase soft news content in the media, because it increases the voting consistency of those with little political knowledge.

'''The Poppy Fields''' were a fictitious teenage group, invented by the [[Wales|Welsh]] rock band, [[The Alarm]]. The Poppy Fields scored a hit with the release of "[[45 RPM (song)|45 RPM]]" that would become The Alarm's first hit in over a decade. [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]] revealed the truth on live radio as [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] was conducting a 2004 broadcast of their then current chart countdown. The story was highlighted by international news outlets with several headlines being published globally.

Immediately after exposing the hoax, the music video for "45 RPM" was replaced by an edited version that included The Alarm's members alongside the hyped members of The Poppy Fields.&lt;ref name="mnews" /&gt; Peters had enticed a young band called the Wayriders to lip-sync the song for the music video while posing as members of the nonexistent group.&lt;ref name="amusic" /&gt; The events surrounding this hoax have spawned the cinematic release of ''[[Vinyl (2012 film)|Vinyl]]'', its soundtrack, The Alarm ''Vinyl Tour 2013'', and the subsequent announcement of a 2013 tour by The Alarm in support of the soundtrack.&lt;ref name="mnews" /&gt;

== Hoax ==

In an interview with [[BBC News]] Online, [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]] said "[[The Alarm]], most famous for their 1983 hit '[[68 Guns]]', were not always taken seriously by DJs" because of a combination of the age of the band's members and a perception that their image was outdated. Peters said, "The Alarm as an entity have been going for 20-odd years and history can go against you &amp;ndash; we wanted to break the barrier down." He continued by saying that "[The Alarm members] wanted to stir up the water a little bit, break the mould" and have the song judged on its own merits and musical value, instead of judgement being based on the perception of the band.&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; Peters told ''[[The Guardian]]'': "We noticed that a lot of bands suffer when they attempt comebacks because people generally don't believe they can ever be as good as they once were. We wanted to make sure we are judged purely on the strength of the music, and not by our old hairstyles."&lt;ref name="BBCNewsWales" /&gt;

=== The Poppy Fields ===

With The Alarm's decision to perpetrate the hoax, Mike Peters gained the cooperation of a group of young musicians from [[Chester]] called the Wayriders&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; to lip-sync The Alarm's material and pass it off as their own. The first release by the fictitious band was promoted as a cover of The Alarm's 1983 hit, "[[68 Guns]]".&lt;ref name="encofpm" /&gt; In fact it was The Alarm all along, and instead of a cover, it was a re-released version. The demo enticed executives in music production to record an album from the band called ''In The Poppy Fields'' which saw its advance release of the single, "45 RPM" entering Britain's top 30 chart. Critical reviews of the band echoed the promoters' official introduction of the band as a tribute to bands like [[Sex Pistols]], and [[The Clash]], with even more modern acts like [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] being compared.&lt;ref name="musicomh" /&gt; The truth of the song's origin was not revealed until after the song entered the charts at number 24,&lt;ref name="BBCNews2" /&gt; a credit originally earned by The Poppy Fields from unsuspecting patrons who had accepted the act as fresh and new.&lt;ref name="11-30" /&gt;

== ''Vinyl'' ==

Filming for ''[[Vinyl (2012 film)|Vinyl]]'' began in the [[Denbighshire]] resort town of [[Rhyl]] in August 2010.&lt;ref name="BBCNews2" /&gt; ''Vinyl''{{'}}s soundtrack features new songs by [[The Alarm]] specifically composed for the film including the cinematic anthem, "Free Rock And Roll", recorded by The Alarm with ''Vinyl''{{'}}s leading actor, [[Phil Daniels]],&lt;ref name="BBCNews3" /&gt; in a song with The Alarm's lead vocalist and founding member, Mike Peters. The song was released as an EP single on 28 January 2013 in tandem with a national television campaign featuring both the film's cast and members of The Alarm.&lt;ref name="alarm" /&gt;

'''''To the Last Man: A Story of the Pleasant Valley War''''' is a western novel written by [[Zane Grey]].

==Origin==
''To The Last Man'' is a shorter version of ''[[Tonto Basin (novel)|Tonto Basin]]''. Grey submitted the manuscript of ''Tonto Basin'' to the magazine ''The Country Gentleman,'' which published it in serialization as ''To the Last Man'' from May 28, 1921 through July 30, 1921. This was a much shorter version of the  original leaving out much of the [[backstory]]. This shorter version was published by [[Harper Brothers]].

==Plot introduction==
It is a story of a family feud healed by young love.  The story is based on a factual event involving the notorious Hashknife gang of Northern Arizona.

==Plot summary==
The story follows an ancient feud between two frontier families that is inflamed
when one of the families takes up cattle rustling.

The ranchers are led by Jean Isbel and, on the other side, Lee Jorth and his band of cattle rustlers.

In the grip of a relentless code of loyalty to their own people, they fight the war of the Tonto Basin, desperately, doggedly, to the last man, neither side seeing the futility of it until it is too late. And in this volatile environment, young Jean finds himself hopelessly in love with a girl from whom he is separated by an impassable barrier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6533">[[File:Lockerbie disaster memorial.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A memorial is often established to remember lives lost in a tragedy such as the [[Lockerbie air disaster]]]]
A '''tragedy''' is an event of great loss, usually of human life.  Such an event is said to be ''tragic''. Traditionally the event would require "some element of moral failure, some flaw in character, or some extraordinary combination of elements"&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920405&amp;slug=1484688&lt;/ref&gt; to be tragic.

Not all death is considered a tragedy. Rather it is a precise set of symptoms surrounding the loss that define it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crisis Intervention Training for Disaster Workers: An Introduction |last=Doherty |first=George W. |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=12 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of factors that define a death as ''tragic''.

An event in which a massive number of deaths occur may be seen as a tragedy. This can be re-enforced by media attention or other public outcry.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=1 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tragedy does not necessarily involve [[massacre|massive death]]. The death of a single person, e.g., a public figure or a child, may be seen as a tragedy.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt; The person need not necessarily have been [[celebrity|famous]] before death.

==Factors that make death a tragedy==
Generally, the label of "tragedy" is given to an event based on public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=11 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of factors that can make a death be considered a tragedy.

===Scope===
The scope of an event can affect the public view, and make it appear tragic. This can be the case whether the death toll is high, or if a single, unexpected death occurs in a well-beloved person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=5 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of attachment in the public eye may also impact whether or not the event is publicly labeled as a tragedy. For example, the unexpected death of a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] student that receives heavy media attention may be seen as more tragic than that of a [[recidivism|recidivist]] prisoner who is beaten to death by fellow inmates.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1 /&gt;

===Prematurity===
A death may be viewed as a tragedy when it is premature in nature. An old person dying of old age is an expectation, but the death of a child or of a young, healthy adult that is not expected by others can be viewed as tragic.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Publicity]] is a factor in making the public view an event as a tragedy. With publicity of a large number of deaths or even a single death, this plays on the emotions of the general public, and thereby impacts perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=3 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of coverage affects the number of people in whose eyes the event is viewed as tragic. While local coverage may garner sympathy from those in the hometown of the deceased, international coverage may lead the whole world to mourn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The resulting consequences from one or more deaths can be seen as a tragedy. For example, if a large number of persons are killed in a terrorist attack, not only is life lost, but others may lose their sense of security, and this impacts the lives of others in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=8 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasting effects===
The long-term effects of an event can render it as tragic. Tragedies often have effects that shape those affected, and are remembered even long after, as they clearly impact the future for those involved. They may also be commemorated on anniversaries or whenever they otherwise come to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional; by Stephen B. Roberts, Willard W. C. Ashley; {{ISBN|978-1-59473-240-9}}; page 67&lt;/ref&gt; A public tragedy often leads to measures being taken to prevent similar tragic events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional, and National Tragedy |last=Roberts |first=Stephen B.  |authorlink= |author2=Willard W. C. Ashley  |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-1-59473-240-9 |page=86 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dealing with tragedy==
There are various ways tragedy can affect people.

The typical reaction to tragedy is heavy [[grief]], followed by a slow recovery. Common feelings following a tragedy include [[sadness]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[crying]], [[blame]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy: A psychiatrist offers ways to deal with trauma and grief |author=Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D. |newspaper=Ebony Magazine |date=February 1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=coping+with+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jUT4TIfBFIWClAe0rvGgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=coping%20with%20tragedy&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some people wonder what they did to deserve such suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with Tragedy |last=Ramsey |first=Tara |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=33 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, their [[religion|faith]] may be a source of comfort in the wake of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith in the Fast Lane |last=Owens |first=Ken |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=106 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 – ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 – ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

19 – ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

17 – ''[[Washington Post]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogotá, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo

15 – ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

13 – ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

13 – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul

12 – ''[[The Hindu]]'' (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington  

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.

'''''You Me Bum Bum Train''''' is an [[Interactive theatre]] performance devised by Kate Bond and Morgan Lloyd in 2004. The pair met as art students in Brighton, where they were studying illustration and film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/you-me-bum-bum-train-all-aboard-for-the-ride-of-a-lifetime-a2473106.html ''Evening Standard'' interview, 11 August 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''You Me Bum Bum Train'' gained critical acclaim in the United Kingdom when it was awarded the [[Samuel Beckett Award|Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust prize]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |title=Barbican announces Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust award-winner|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730232240/http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while showing in a disused office in London. In 2010 it won the [[Evening Standard Theatre Award]] for outstanding newcomer. 

It returned in 2012 in a former postal depot in [[Holborn]], and a new version of the show – at Empire House in Stratford, east London in 2012 – was nominated for an [[Olivier Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |title=Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre - Olivier Awards|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402194001/http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the show was mounted again, this time in at what had been [[Foyles]] bookshop on London's [[Charing Cross Road]] where their last show, started on 25 February 2016, finished on 29 April.

==Overview==
Visitors to the performance pass through a series of scenes of which they have no foreknowledge, in which they are either passive or where they must improvise a part without any preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Dickson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/11/best-theatre-2012-you-me-bum |title=Best theatre of 2012, No 9: You Me Bum Bum Train &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna Hanra, writing for ''Vice'', described it as a series of "highly detailed, absurd real life scenarios following one another on a nonsense high-paced narrative".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/you-me-bum-bum-train-378 ''Vice'' interview, 19 June 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The entertainment magazine ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'' reported; "What was one of London's more obtuse treasures is set to become one of Great Britain's proudest moments." ''[[The Times]]'' said; "It leaves you questioning everything, and it's lots of fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/style/article1480556.ece|title=Album review|newspaper=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] magazine wrote; "My highlight of 2008 was You Me Bum Bum Train, if only real life were that interesting."

==Controversies==
''You Me Bum Bum Train'' has provoked controversy due to the fact that none of the performers gets paid, though the directors stress that performers and crew are involved on a voluntary basis, that many are not trained professionals and that they are under no obligation to stay during performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnett|first=Laura|title=You Me Bum Bum Train gives actors a bad ride, says union|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/13/you-me-bum-bum-train-equity|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=Theguardian.co.uk|date=13 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/07/equity-warns-sell-out-show-of-possible-minimum-wage-breach/|title=Equity warns sell-out show of possible minimum wage breach - News - The Stage|author=Natalie Woolman|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was criticized for its ticketing system which caused problems for ticket buyers in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/ticketing-bum-bum-train-fire/|title=Ticketing for You Me Bum Bum Train under fire - Carousel, News - The Stage|author=Matthew Hemley|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 the trade union Equity criticised their £150,000 Arts Council England funding as YMBBT were advertising for professional dancers but were not paying them, despite selling tickets "at rates typical of a West End show." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.equity.org.uk/news-and-events/equity-news/equity-questions-arts-council-funding-decision/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/bum-bum-train-comes-fire-actors-union/agencies/article/1374456&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the trade union BECTU criticised YMBBT for "exploiting workers after advertising for unpaid production interns." BECTU launched an investigation concerning "the legality of the “outrageous” internships, which would see successful applicants work at least two days each week for a minimum four hours each day." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2016/bectu-launches-probe-exploitative-bum-bum-train-internships/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2016/alistair-smith-show-producers-pay-stance-hits-a-bum-note/&lt;/ref&gt;
