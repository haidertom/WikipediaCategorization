      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20819">'''Aether theories''' (also known as '''ether theories''') in [[physics]] propose the existence of a medium, the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] (also spelled ''ether'', from the Greek word ({{lang|grc|αἰθήρ}}), meaning "upper air" or "pure, fresh air"&lt;ref name=aetherDict&gt;"''[http://www.bartleby.com/61/85/A0118500.html Aether] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203022126/http://www.bartleby.com/61/85/A0118500.html |date=December 3, 2005 }}''", American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.&lt;/ref&gt;), a space-filling substance or field, thought to be necessary as a [[transmission medium]] for the propagation of electromagnetic or gravitational forces. The assorted ''aether theories'' embody the various conceptions of this "''[[Medium (optics)|medium]]''" and "''[[Substance theory|substance]]''". This [[early modern]] aether has little in common with the [[Aether (classical element)|aether of classical elements]] from which the name was borrowed. Since the development of [[special relativity]], theories using a substantial aether fell out of use in [[modern physics]], and were replaced by more abstract models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Historical models ==

===Luminiferous aether===
{{main|Luminiferous aether|History of special relativity}}

[[Isaac Newton]] suggests the existence of an aether in the Third Book of ''[[Opticks]]'' (1718): "Doth not this aethereal medium in passing out of water, glass, crystal, and other compact and dense bodies in empty spaces, grow denser and denser by degrees, and by that means refract the rays of light not in a point, but by bending them gradually in curve lines? ...Is not this medium much rarer within the dense bodies of the Sun, stars, planets and comets, than in the empty celestial space between them? And in passing from them to great distances, doth it not grow denser and denser perpetually, and thereby cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another, and of their parts towards the bodies; every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the medium towards the rarer?"&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton The Third Book of Opticks (1718) http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/NATP00051&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, luminiferous aether (or ether), meaning light-bearing aether, was a theorized medium for the propagation of light (electromagnetic radiation). However, a series of increasingly complex experiments had been carried out in the late 1800s like the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] in an attempt to detect the motion of Earth through the aether, and had failed to do so. A range of proposed [[Aether drag hypothesis|aether-dragging theories]] could explain the null result but these were more complex, and tended to use arbitrary-looking coefficients and physical assumptions. [[Joseph Larmor]] discussed the aether in terms of a moving magnetic field caused by the acceleration of electrons.

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] said of the aether, "In several parts of this treatise an attempt has been made to explain electromagnetic phenomena by means of mechanical action transmitted from one body to another by means of a medium occupying the space between them. The undulatory theory of light also assumes the existence of a medium. We have now to show that the properties of the electromagnetic medium are identical with those of the luminiferous medium."&lt;ref&gt;James Clerk Maxwell: "[[s: A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism/Part IV/Chapter XX|A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism/Part IV/Chapter XX]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[George Francis FitzGerald]] offered within the framework of [[Lorentz ether theory]] a more elegant solution to how the motion of an absolute aether could be undetectable (length contraction), but if their equations were correct, [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1905 [[special theory of relativity]] could generate the same mathematics without referring to an aether at all. This led most physicists to conclude that this early modern notion of a luminiferous aether was not a useful concept. Einstein however stated that this consideration was too radical and too anticipatory and that his theory of relativity still needed the presence of a medium with certain properties.
&lt;!--Note that  A. Einstein claimed afterwards that “the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether.”  and  “According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable.”&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A. "Ether and the Theory of Relativity".  http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Einstein_ether.html )&lt;/ref&gt; The first step of the new approach&lt;ref&gt;Foigel, AG. (2005). "An interpretation of relativistic mechanics". ''Annalen de la Fondation Louis de Broglie '''''30''': 289-307&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the results concerning the independence of the unidirectional light speed on the velocity of the light source. These results were obtained by W. de Sitter while observing binary stars.&lt;ref&gt;De Sitter, W. (1913). "A proof of the constancy of the velocity of light". ''Proceedings of the Royal  Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences''''' 15'''II, 1297-1298.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

=== Mechanical gravitational aether ===
{{main|Mechanical explanations of gravitation}}
From the 16th until the late 19th century, gravitational phenomena had also been modelled utilizing an aether. The most well-known formulation is [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation]], although other models were proposed by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Lord Kelvin]]. None of those concepts are considered to be viable by the scientific community today.

== Non-standard interpretations in modern physics ==

=== General relativity ===
{{main|Einstein's views on the aether}}

Einstein sometimes used the word ''aether'' for the gravitational field within [[general relativity]], but this terminology never gained widespread support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Kostro, L.|chapter=An outline of the history of Einstein's relativistic ether concept|title=Studies in the history of general relativity |editor=Jean Eisenstaedt |editor2=Anne J. Kox|volume=3|pages=260–280|isbn=978-0-8176-3479-7|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Boston-Basel-Berlin|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|We may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time.

=== Quantum vacuum ===
[[Quantum mechanics]] can be used to describe [[spacetime]] as being non-empty at extremely small scales, fluctuating and generating [[pair production|particle pairs]] that appear and disappear incredibly quickly. It has been suggested by some such as [[Paul Dirac]]&lt;ref name="Dirac, Paul 1951 p. 906"&gt;Dirac, Paul: "Is there an Aether?", Nature 168 (1951), p. 906.&lt;/ref&gt; that this [[quantum vacuum]] may be the equivalent in modern physics of a particulate aether. However, Dirac's aether hypothesis was motivated by his dissatisfaction with [[quantum electrodynamics]], and it never gained support from the mainstream scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Robert B. Laughlin]], Nobel Laureate in Physics, endowed chair in physics, Stanford University, had this to say about ether in contemporary theoretical physics:

{{quote|It is ironic that Einstein's most creative work, the general theory of relativity, should boil down to conceptualizing space as a medium when his original premise [in special relativity] was that no such medium existed [..] The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity. This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum.  . . . Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry. [..] It turns out that such matter exists. About the time relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids. Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness. It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part. The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether. But we do not call it this because it is taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laughlin|first=Robert B.|title=A Different Universe: Reinventing Physics from the Bottom Down|date=2005|publisher=Basic Books|location=NY, NY|isbn=978-0-465-03828-2|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Pilot waves ===
{{Main|Pilot wave|De Broglie–Bohm theory}}

[[Louis de Broglie]] stated, "Any particle, ever isolated, has to be imagined as in continuous "energetic contact" with a hidden medium."&lt;ref name=deBroglieHiddenMedium&gt;[http://aflb.ensmp.fr/AFLB-classiques/aflb124p001.pdf Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie, Volume 12, no.4, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1983FoPh...13..253P |doi=10.1007/BF01889484 |quote=It is shown that one can deduce the de Broglie waves as real collective Markov processes on the top of Dirac's aether|title=Dirac's aether in relativistic quantum mechanics |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=253 |last1=Petroni |first1=Nicola Cufaro |last2=Vigier |first2=Jean Pierre |year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conjectures and proposals ==

According to the philosophical point of view of Einstein, Dirac, Bell, Polyakov, ’t Hooft, Laughlin, de Broglie, Maxwell, Newton and other theorists, there might be a medium with physical properties filling 'empty' space, an aether, enabling the observed physical processes.

[[Albert Einstein]] in 1894 or 1895: "The velocity of a wave is proportional to the square root of the elastic forces which cause [its] propagation, and inversely proportional to the mass of the aether moved by these forces."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein's 'First' Paper (1894 or 1895), http://www.straco.ch/papers/Einstein%20First%20Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Einstein in 1920: "We may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an Aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without Aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this Aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of  ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert: "[[s: Ether and the Theory of Relativity|Ether and the Theory of Relativity]]" (1920), republished in ''Sidelights on Relativity'' (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Dirac]] wrote in 1951:&lt;ref name="Dirac, Paul 1951 p. 906"/&gt; "Physical knowledge has advanced much since 1905, notably by the arrival of quantum mechanics, and the situation [about the scientific plausibility of Aether] has again changed. If one examines the question in the light of present-day knowledge, one finds that the Aether is no longer ruled out by relativity, and good reasons can now be advanced for postulating an Aether ... We have now the velocity at all points of space-time, playing a fundamental part in electrodynamics. It is natural to regard it as the velocity of some real physical thing. Thus with the new theory of electrodynamics [vacuum filled with virtual particles] we are rather forced to have an Aether".

[[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] in 1986, interviewed by [[Paul Davies]] in "The Ghost in the Atom" has suggested that an Aether theory might help resolve the [[EPR paradox]] by allowing a [[frame of reference|reference frame]] in which signals go faster than light. He suggests [[Lorentz contraction]] is perfectly coherent, not inconsistent with relativity, and could produce an aether theory perfectly consistent with the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]]. Bell suggests the aether was wrongly rejected on purely philosophical grounds: "what is unobservable does not exist" [p.&amp;nbsp;49]. Einstein found the non-aether theory simpler and more elegant, but Bell suggests that doesn't rule it out. Besides the arguments based on his interpretation of quantum mechanics, Bell also suggests resurrecting the aether because it is a useful pedagogical device. That is, many problems are solved more easily by imagining the existence of an aether.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Einstein remarked "God does not play dice with the Universe". And those agreeing with him are looking for a classical, deterministic aether theory that would imply quantum-mechanical predictions as a statistical approximation, a [[hidden variable theory]]. In particular, [[Gerard 't Hooft]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Brunetti and A. Zeilinger (Eds.), ''Quantum (Un)speakables'', Springer, Berlin (2002), Ch. 22&lt;/ref&gt; conjectured that: "We should not forget that quantum mechanics does not really describe what kind of dynamical phenomena are actually going on, but rather gives us probabilistic results. To me, it seems extremely plausible that any reasonable theory for the dynamics at the Planck scale would lead to processes that are so complicated to describe, that one should expect apparently stochastic fluctuations in any approximation theory describing the effects of all of this at much larger scales. It seems quite reasonable first to try a classical, deterministic theory for the Planck domain. One might speculate then that what we call quantum mechanics today, may be nothing else than an ingenious technique to handle this dynamics statistically." In their paper Blasone, Jizba and Kleinert "have attempted to substantiate the recent proposal of G. ’t Hooft in which quantum theory is viewed as not a complete field theory, but is in fact an emergent phenomenon arising from a deeper level of dynamics. The underlying dynamics are taken to be classical mechanics with singular Lagrangians supplied with an appropriate information loss condition. With plausible assumptions about the actual nature of the constraint dynamics, quantum theory is shown to emerge when the classical Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for constrained dynamics is applied to the classical path integral [...]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = quant-ph/0409021|bibcode = 2005PhRvA..71e2507B|title = Path-integral approach to 't Hooft's derivation of quantum physics from classical physics|journal = Physical Review A|volume = 71|issue = 5|pages = 052507|last1 = Blasone|first1 = Massimo|last2 = Jizba|first2 = Petr|last3 = Kleinert|first3 = Hagen|year = 2005|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.71.052507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis de Broglie]], "If a hidden sub-quantum medium is assumed, knowledge of its nature would seem desirable. It certainly is of quite complex character. It could not serve as a universal reference medium, as this would be contrary to relativity theory."&lt;ref name=deBroglieHiddenMedium /&gt;

In 1982, [[Ioan-Iovitz Popescu]], a [[Romania]]n physicist, wrote that the aether is "a form of existence of the matter, but it differs qualitatively from the common (atomic and molecular) substance or radiation (photons)". The ''fluid aether'' is "governed by the principle of inertia and its presence produces a modification of the space-time geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duursma|first1=Egbert (Ed.)|title=Etherons as predicted by Ioan-Iovitz Popescu in 1982|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1511906371|date=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built upon [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's]] ''ultra-mundane corpuscles'', Popescu's theory posits a finite Universe "filled with some particles of exceedingly small mass, traveling chaotically at speed of light" and material bodies "made up of such particles called ''etherons''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Climont|first1=Jean|title=The Worldwide List of Alternative Theories and Critics.

Sid Deutsch, a professor of electrical engineering and bioengineerig, conjectures that a "spherical, spinning" ''aether particle'' must exist in order "to carry electromagnetic waves" and derives its diameter and mass using the [[density]] of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deutsch|first1=Sid|title=Einstein's Greatest Mistake: Abandonment of the Aether|date=2006|chapter=Chapter 9: An Aether Particle (AP)|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-37481-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Degenerate matter|degenerate]] [[Fermi liquid theory|Fermi fluid]] model, "composed primarily of ''electrons and positrons''" that has the consequence of a speed of light decreasing "with time on the scale of the age of the universe" was proposed by Allen Rothwarf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/89ff/2b625440f3a4177060ebd76dcd1e3971bd94.pdf Rothwarf, A., “An Aether Model of the Universe”, 	Physics Essays, vol. 11, issue 3, p. 444 (1998)], Semantic Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Physical cosmology|cosmological extension]] the [[Theory#Philosophical views|model]] was "extended to predict a ''decelerating expansion of the universe''".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0703/0703280.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aharonov–Bohm effect''', sometimes called the '''Ehrenberg–Siday–Aharonov–Bohm''' effect, is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon in which an [[electric charge|electrically charged]] [[point particle|particle]] is affected by an [[electromagnetic potential]] ('''V''', '''A'''), despite being confined to a region in which both the [[magnetic field]] '''B''' and [[electric field]] '''E''' are zero.&lt;ref name="Significance of electromagnetic potentials in quantum theory"&gt;

The most commonly described case, sometimes called the '''Aharonov–Bohm solenoid effect''', takes place when the wave function of a charged particle passing around a long [[solenoid]] experiences a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]] as a result of the enclosed magnetic field, despite the magnetic field being negligible in the region through which the particle passes and the particle's wavefunction being negligible inside the solenoid.

An electric Aharonov–Bohm phenomenon was also predicted, in which a charged particle is affected by regions with different [[electrical potential]]s but zero electric field, but this has no experimental confirmation yet.&lt;ref name="The Aharonov–Bohm effects: Variations on a Subtle Theme." /&gt; A separate "molecular" Aharonov–Bohm effect was proposed for nuclear motion in multiply connected regions, but this has been argued to be a different kind of [[geometric phase]] as it is "neither nonlocal nor topological", depending only on local quantities along the nuclear path.&lt;ref&gt;

== Significance ==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, physics was dominated by Newtonian dynamics, with its emphasis on [[force (physics)|forces]]. Electromagnetic phenomena were elucidated by a series of experiments involving the measurement of forces between charges, [[electrical current|currents]] and magnets in various configurations. Eventually, a description arose according to which charges, currents and magnets acted as local sources of propagating force fields, which then acted on other charges and currents locally through the [[Lorentz force law]]. In this framework, because one of the observed properties of the electric field was that it was [[curl (mathematics)|irrotational]], and one of the observed properties of the magnetic field was that it was [[divergence]]less, it was possible to express an electrostatic field as the [[gradient]] of a scalar potential (e.g. [[Coulomb]]'s electrostatic potential, which is mathematically analogous to the classical gravitational potential) and a stationary magnetic field as the curl of a vector potential (then a new concept – the idea of a scalar potential was already well accepted by analogy with gravitational potential). The language of potentials generalised seamlessly to the fully dynamic case but, since all physical effects were describable in terms of the fields which were the derivatives of the potentials, potentials (unlike fields) were not uniquely determined by physical effects: potentials were only defined up to an arbitrary additive constant electrostatic potential and an irrotational stationary magnetic vector potential.

The Aharonov–Bohm effect is important conceptually because it bears on three issues apparent in the recasting of ([[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s) [[classical electromagnetism|classical electromagnetic theory]] as a [[gauge theory]], which before the advent of quantum mechanics could be argued to be a mathematical reformulation with no physical consequences. The Aharonov–Bohm [[thought experiment]]s and their experimental realization imply that the issues were not just philosophical.

The three issues are: 
#whether potentials are "physical" or just a convenient tool for calculating force fields;
#whether [[action (physics)|action]] [[principle of stationary action|principle]]s are fundamental; 
#the [[principle of locality]].

Because of reasons like these, the Aharonov–Bohm effect was chosen by the ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine as one of the "seven wonders of the quantum world".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/special/seven-wonders-of-the-quantum-world "Seven wonders of the quantum world"], newscientist.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potentials vs. fields ===
It is generally argued that Aharonov–Bohm effect illustrates the physicality of electromagnetic potentials, ''Φ'' and '''A''', in quantum mechanics.  Classically it was possible to argue that only the [[electromagnetic field]]s are physical, while the electromagnetic potentials are purely mathematical constructs, that due to [[gauge freedom]] aren't even unique for a given electromagnetic field.

However, Vaidman has challenged this interpretation by showing that the AB effect can be explained without the use of potentials so long as one gives a full quantum mechanical treatment to the source charges that produce the electromagnetic field.&lt;ref name="Vaidman2012"&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Vaidman |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Role of potentials in the Aharonov-Bohm effect |journal=Physical Review A |date=Oct 2012|volume=86|issue=4|pages=040101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.86.040101|arxiv = 1110.6169 |bibcode = 2012PhRvA..86d0101V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this view, the potential in quantum mechanics is just as physical (or non-physical) as it was classically. Aharonov, Cohen, and Rohrlich responded that the effect may be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1605.05470|last1 = Sjöqvist|first1 = Erik|title = On the paper 'Role of potentials in the Aharonov-Bohm effect'|class = quant-ph|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two papers published in the journal in 2017 ''[[Physical Review A]]'' have demonstrated a quantum mechanical solution for the system. Their analysis shows that the phase shift can be viewed as generated by solenoid's vector potential acting on the electron or the electron's vector potential acting on the solenoid or the electron and solenoid currents acting on the quantized vector potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= P. Pearle|author2= A. Rizzi|title= Quantum-mechanical inclusion of the source in the Aharonov-Bohm effects|journal=Phys Rev A|date=2017|volume=95|issue= 5|pages=052123|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.95.052123|arxiv= 1507.00068|bibcode= 2017PhRvA..95e2123P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= P.

=== Global action vs. local forces ===

Similarly, the Aharonov–Bohm effect illustrates that the [[Lagrangian dynamics|Lagrangian approach to dynamics]], based on [[action (physics)|energies]], is not just a computational aid to the [[Newtonian dynamics|Newtonian approach]], based on [[force (physics)|forces]]. Thus the Aharonov–Bohm effect validates the view that forces are an incomplete way to formulate physics, and potential energies must be used instead. In fact [[Richard Feynman]] complained{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} that he had been taught electromagnetism from the perspective of electromagnetic fields, and he wished later in life he had been taught to think in terms of the electromagnetic potential instead, as this would be more fundamental. In Feynman's [[path integral formulation|path-integral view of dynamics]], the potential field directly changes the phase of an electron wave function, and it is these changes in phase that lead to measurable quantities.

=== Locality of electromagnetic effects ===
The Aharonov–Bohm effect shows that the local '''E''' and '''B''' fields do not contain full information about the electromagnetic field, and the [[electromagnetic four-potential]], (''Φ'', '''A'''), must be used instead. By [[Stokes' theorem]], the magnitude of the Aharonov–Bohm effect can be calculated using the electromagnetic fields alone, ''or'' using the four-potential alone. But when using just the electromagnetic fields, the effect depends on the field values in a region from which the test particle is excluded. In contrast, when using just the electromagnetic four-potential, the effect only depends on the potential in the region where the test particle is allowed.  Therefore, one must either abandon the [[principle of locality]], which most physicists are reluctant to do, or accept that the electromagnetic four-potential offers a more complete description of electromagnetism than the electric and magnetic fields can. On the other hand, the AB effect is crucially quantum mechanical; quantum mechanics is well-known to feature [[Quantum nonlocality|non-local effects]] (albeit still disallowing superluminal communication), and Vaidman has argued that this is just a non-local quantum effect in a different form.&lt;ref name="Vaidman2012" /&gt;

In [[classical electromagnetism]] the two descriptions were equivalent. With the addition of quantum theory, though, the electromagnetic potentials ''Φ'' and '''A''' are seen as being more fundamental.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Feynman, R|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics|volume=2 |pages=15–25|quote=knowledge of the classical electromagnetic field acting locally on a particle is not sufficient to predict its quantum-mechanical behavior.'' and ''...is the vector potential a "real" field? ... a real field is a mathematical device for avoiding the idea of action at a distance. .... for a long time it was believed that '''A''' was not a "real" field. .... there are phenomena involving quantum mechanics which show that in fact '''A''' is a "real" field in the sense that we have defined it..... '''E''' and '''B''' are slowly disappearing from the modern expression of physical laws; they are being replaced by '''A''' [the vector potential] and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;[the scalar potential]|title-link=The Feynman Lectures on Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Despite this, all observable effects end up being expressible in terms of the electromagnetic fields, '''E''' and '''B'''.  This is interesting because, while you can calculate the electromagnetic field from the four-potential, due to [[gauge freedom]] the reverse is not true.

==Magnetic solenoid effect==

The magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effect can be seen as a result of the requirement that quantum physics be invariant with respect to the [[gauge fixing|gauge choice]] for the [[electromagnetic potential]], of which the [[magnetic vector potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; forms part.

Electromagnetic theory implies that a particle with electric charge &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; travelling along some path &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in a region with zero [[magnetic field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, but non-zero &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; (by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = 0 = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;), acquires a phase shift &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, given in [[SI]] units by

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{q}{\hbar} \int_P \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{x},&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, particles, with the same start and end points, but travelling along two different routes will acquire a phase difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta \varphi&lt;/math&gt; determined by the [[magnetic flux]] &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B&lt;/math&gt; through the area between the paths (via [[Stokes' theorem]] and &lt;math&gt;\nabla  \times \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;), and given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\varphi = \frac{q\Phi_B}{\hbar}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Aharonov-Bohm effect.svg|thumbnail|right|250px|Schematic of double-slit experiment in which the Aharonov–Bohm effect can be observed: electrons pass through two slits, interfering at an observation screen, with the interference pattern shifted when a magnetic field '''B''' is turned on in the cylindrical solenoid.]]

In [[quantum mechanics]] the same particle can travel between two points by a [[sum over histories|variety of paths]].  Therefore, this phase difference can be observed by placing a [[solenoid]] between the slits of a [[double-slit experiment]] (or equivalent). An ideal solenoid (i.e. infinitely long and with a perfectly uniform current distribution) encloses a magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, but does not produce any magnetic field outside of its cylinder, and thus the charged particle (e.g. an [[electron]]) passing outside experiences no magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;. However, there is a ([[Curl (mathematics)|curl]]-free) vector potential &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; outside the solenoid with an enclosed flux, and so the relative phase of particles passing through one slit or the other is altered by whether the solenoid current is turned on or off. This corresponds to an observable shift of the interference fringes on the observation plane.

The same phase effect is responsible for the [[magnetic flux quantum|quantized-flux]] requirement in [[superconductivity|superconducting]] loops. This quantization occurs because the superconducting wave function must be single valued: its phase difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta \varphi&lt;/math&gt; around a closed loop must be an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; (with the charge &lt;math&gt;q=2e&lt;/math&gt; for the electron [[Cooper pair]]s), and thus the flux must be a multiple of &lt;math&gt;h/2e&lt;/math&gt;. The superconducting flux quantum was actually predicted prior to Aharonov and Bohm, by F. London in 1948 using a phenomenological model.&lt;ref&gt;

===Monopoles and Dirac strings===

The magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effect is also closely related to [[Paul Dirac|Dirac's]] argument that the existence of a [[magnetic monopole]] can be accommodated by the existing magnetic source-free [[Maxwell's equations]] if both electric and magnetic charges are quantized.

A magnetic monopole implies a mathematical singularity in the vector potential, which can be expressed as a [[Dirac string]] of infinitesimal diameter that contains the equivalent of all of the 4π''g'' flux from a monopole "charge" ''g''. The Dirac string starts from, and terminates on, a magnetic monopole.  Thus, assuming the absence of an infinite-range scattering effect by this arbitrary choice of singularity, the requirement of single-valued wave functions (as above) necessitates charge-quantization. That is, &lt;math&gt;2\frac{q_\text{e}q_\text{m}}{\hbar c}&lt;/math&gt; must be an integer (in [[Gaussian units|cgs]] units) for any electric charge ''q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and magnetic charge ''q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

Like the [[electromagnetic potential]] '''A''' the Dirac string is not gauge invariant (it moves around with fixed endpoints under a gauge transformation) and so is also not directly measurable.

==Electric effect==

Just as the phase of the wave function depends upon the magnetic vector potential, it also depends upon the scalar electric potential. By constructing a situation in which the electrostatic potential varies for two paths of a particle, through regions of zero electric field, an observable Aharonov–Bohm interference phenomenon from the phase shift has been predicted; again, the absence of an electric field means that, classically, there would be no effect.

From the [[Schrödinger equation]], the phase of an eigenfunction with energy ''E'' goes as &lt;math&gt;e^{-iEt/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;. The energy, however, will depend upon the electrostatic potential ''V'' for a particle with charge ''q''. In particular, for a region with constant potential ''V'' (zero field), the electric potential energy ''qV'' is simply added to ''E'', resulting in a phase shift:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\phi = -\frac{qVt}{\hbar} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the time spent in the potential.

The initial theoretical proposal for this effect suggested an experiment where charges pass through conducting cylinders along two paths, which shield the particles from external electric fields in the regions where they travel, but still allow a varying potential to be applied by charging the cylinders. This proved difficult to realize, however. Instead, a different experiment was proposed involving a ring geometry interrupted by tunnel barriers, with a bias voltage ''V'' relating the potentials of the two halves of the ring. This situation results in an Aharonov–Bohm phase shift as above, and was observed experimentally in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

Several experiments, including some reported in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= M. Tsubota|author2= K. Inagaki|author3= T. Matsuura|author4= S.

This behavior is similar to that of the superconducting quantum interference devices (see [[SQUID]]).

==Mathematical interpretation==

{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The Aharonov–Bohm effect can be understood from the fact that one can only measure absolute values of the wave function. While this allows for measurement of phase differences through quantum interference experiments, there is no way to specify a wavefunction with constant absolute phase. In the absence of an electromagnetic field one can come close by declaring the eigenfunction of the momentum operator with zero momentum to be the function "1" (ignoring normalization problems) and specifying wave functions relative to this eigenfunction "1". In this representation the i-momentum operator is (up to a factor &lt;math&gt;\hbar/i&lt;/math&gt;) the differential operator &lt;math&gt; \partial_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;. However, by gauge invariance, it is equally valid to declare the zero momentum eigenfunction to be &lt;math&gt; e^{-i\phi(x)} &lt;/math&gt; at the cost of representing the i-momentum operator (up to a factor) as &lt;math&gt;\nabla_i = \partial_i + i(\partial_i \phi)&lt;/math&gt; i.e. with a pure gauge vector potential &lt;math&gt;A = d\phi&lt;/math&gt;. There is no real asymmetry because representing the former in terms of the latter is just as messy as representing the latter in terms of the former. This means that it is physically more natural to describe wave "functions", in the language of [[differential geometry]], as sections in a complex line bundle with a hermitian metric and a U(1)-[[connection (mathematics)|connection]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;. The [[curvature form]] of the connection, &lt;math&gt;i F = \nabla\wedge\nabla &lt;/math&gt;, is, up to the factor i, the [[Faraday tensor]] of the electromagnetic [[field strength]]. The Aharonov–Bohm effect is then a manifestation of the fact that a connection with zero curvature (i.e. [[flat connection|flat]]), need not be trivial since it can have [[monodromy]] along a topologically nontrivial path fully contained in the zero curvature (i.e. field free) region. By definition this means that sections that are parallelly translated along a topologically non trivial path pick up a phase, so that covariant constant sections cannot be defined over the whole field free region.

Given a trivialization of the line-bundle, a non-vanishing section, the U(1)-connection is given by the 1-[[Differential form|form]] corresponding to the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] ''A'' as &lt;math&gt; \nabla = d + i A\,&lt;/math&gt; where ''d'' means [[exterior derivative|exterior derivation]] on the [[Minkowski space]]. The monodromy is the [[holonomy]] of the flat connection. The holonomy of a connection, flat or non flat, around a closed loop &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;e^{i \int_\gamma A}&lt;/math&gt; (one can show this does not depend on the trivialization but only on the connection). For a flat connection one can find a [[Gauge theory|gauge transformation]] in any [[simply connected]] field free region(acting on wave functions and connections) that gauges away the vector potential. However, if the monodromy is nontrivial, there is no such gauge transformation for the whole outside region. In fact as a consequence of [[Stokes' theorem]], the holonomy is determined by the magnetic flux through a surface &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; bounding the loop &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, but such a surface may exist only if &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; passes through a region of non trivial field:

:&lt;math&gt; e^{i \int_{\partial \sigma} A} = e^{i \int_{\sigma} dA} = e^{i\int_\sigma F}&lt;/math&gt;

The monodromy of the flat connection only depends on the topological type of the loop in the field free region (in fact on the loops [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] class). The holonomy description is general, however, and works inside as well as outside the superconductor. Outside of the conducting tube containing the magnetic field, the field strength &lt;math&gt;F = 0&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, outside the tube the connection is flat, and the monodromy of the loop contained in the field-free region depends only on the [[winding number]] around the tube. The monodromy of the connection for a loop going round once (winding number 1) is the phase difference of a particle interfering by propagating left and right of the superconducting tube containing the magnetic field. 
If one wants to ignore the physics inside the superconductor and only describe the physics in the outside region, it becomes natural and mathematically convenient to describe the quantum electron by a section in a complex line bundle with an "external" flat connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; with monodromy

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = &lt;/math&gt; magnetic flux through the tube / &lt;math&gt;(\hbar/e)&lt;/math&gt;

rather than an external EM field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The Schrödinger equation readily generalizes to this situation by using the [[Laplacian]] of the connection for the (free) Hamiltonian

:&lt;math&gt; H  = \frac{1}{2m}\nabla^*\nabla &lt;/math&gt;.

Equivalently, one can work in two simply connected regions with cuts that pass from the tube towards or away from the detection screen. In each of these regions the ordinary free Schrödinger equations would have to be solved, but in passing from one region to the other, in only one of the two connected components of the intersection (effectively in only one of the slits) a monodromy factor &lt;math&gt; e^{i\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is picked up, which results in the shift in the interference pattern as one changes the flux.

Effects with similar mathematical interpretation can be found in other fields. For example, in classical statistical physics, quantization of a molecular motor motion in a stochastic environment can be interpreted as an Aharonov–Bohm effect induced by a gauge field acting in the space of control parameters.&lt;ref name="chernyak-09prl"&gt;

'''Anywhere on Earth''' (AoE) is a calendar designation which indicates that a period expires when the date passes everywhere on Earth. The last place on Earth where any date exists is on [[Howland and Baker islands]], in the [[UTC−12:00|IDLW]] time zone (the West side of the [[International Date Line]]), and so is the last spot on the globe for any day to exist. Therefore, the day ends AoE when it ends on Howland Island.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee802.org/16/aoe.html|title=IEEE 802.16 AOE Deadline Documentation|website=www.ieee802.org|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention originated in [[IEEE 802.16]] balloting procedures. At this point, many IEEE 802 ballot deadlines are established as the end of day using "AoE", for "Anywhere on Earth" as a designation. This means that the deadline has not passed if, anywhere on Earth, the deadline date has not yet passed.

Note that the day's end AoE occurs at noon [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) of the following day,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Howland and Baker islands]] being halfway around the world from the [[prime meridian]] that is the base reference longitude for UTC.

Thus, in standard notation this is:

[[Evolutionary biology]], in particular the understanding of how organisms evolve through natural selection, is an area of science with many practical applications.&lt;ref name=Bull&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bull JJ |author2=Wichman HA |title=Applied evolution |journal=Annu Rev Ecol Syst |volume=32 |pages=183–217 |date=2001 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.32.081501.114020 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mindell|first=DP|title=The Evolving World: Evolution in Everyday Life|date=2007|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0674025585|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists often claim that the theory of evolution lacks any practical applications; however, this claim has been refuted by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claim CA215:  The theory of evolution is useless, without practical application|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA215.html|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider biology==
The evolutionary approach is key to much current research in biology that does not set out to study evolution per se, especially in organismal biology and [[ecology]]. For example, evolutionary thinking is key to [[life history theory]]. [[gene finding|Annotation of genes]] and their function relies heavily on comparative, that is evolutionary, approaches. The field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] investigates how developmental processes work by using the comparative method to determine how they evolved.

==Artificial selection==
{{main|Artificial selection}}
A major technological application of evolution is [[artificial selection]], which is the intentional selection of certain traits in a population of organisms. Humans have used artificial selection for thousands of years in the [[domestication]] of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doebley JF |author2= Gaut BS |author3=Smith BD |title=The molecular genetics of crop domestication |journal=Cell |volume=127 |issue=7 |pages=1309–21 |date=2006 |pmid=17190597 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.006 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, such selection has become a vital part of [[genetic engineering]], with [[selectable marker]]s such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA in [[molecular biology]]. It is also possible to use repeated rounds of mutation and selection to evolve proteins with particular properties, such as modified [[enzyme]]s or new [[antibody|antibodies]], in a process called [[directed evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jäckel C |author2=Kast P |author3=Hilvert D |title=Protein design by directed evolution |journal=Annu Rev Biophys |volume=37 |pages=153–73 |date=2008 |pmid=18573077 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
[[File:Antibiotic resistance.svg|thumb|right|Schematic representation of how antibiotic resistance evolves via natural selection. The top section represents a population of bacteria before exposure to an antibiotic. The middle section shows the population directly after exposure, the phase in which selection took place. The last section shows the distribution of resistance in a new generation of bacteria. The legend indicates the resistance levels of individuals.]]
[[Antibiotic resistance]] can be a result of point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; per chromosomal replication. The antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure; those bacteria which have a mutation allowing them to survive will live on to reproduce. They will then pass this trait to their offspring, which will result in a fully resistant colony.

Understanding the changes that have occurred during organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be involved in human [[genetic disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maher B. |title=Evolution: Biology's next top model? |journal=Nature |volume=458 |issue=7239 |pages=695–8 |date=2009 |doi=10.1038/458695a |pmid=19360058 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Mexican tetra]] is an [[albino]] cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Borowsky R |title=Restoring sight in blind cavefish |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=R23–4 |date=2008 |pmid=18177707 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.023 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation, such as [[crystallin]]s and the [[melanocortin 1 receptor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gross JB |author2=Borowsky R |author3=Tabin CJ |title=A novel role for Mc1r in the parallel evolution of depigmentation in independent populations of the cavefish Astyanax mexicanus |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=e1000326 |date=2009 |pmid=19119422 |pmc=2603666 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000326 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, comparing the genome of the [[Notothenioidei|Antarctic icefish]], which lacks [[red blood cell]]s, to close relatives such as the Antarctic rockcod revealed genes needed to make these blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yergeau DA |author2=Cornell CN |author3=Parker SK |author4=Zhou Y |author5=Detrich HW |title=bloodthirsty, an RBCC/TRIM gene required for erythropoiesis in zebrafish |journal=Dev.

==Computer science==
{{main|Evolutionary computation}}
As evolution can produce highly optimised processes and networks, it has many applications in [[computer science]]. Here, simulations of evolution using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and [[artificial life]] started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by [[Alex Fraser (scientist)|Alex Fraser]], who published a series of papers on simulation of [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraser AS |title=Monte Carlo analyses of genetic models |journal=Nature |volume=181 |issue=4603 |pages=208–9 |date=1958 |pmid=13504138 |doi=10.1038/181208a0 |ref=harv|bibcode=1958Natur.181..208F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary algorithm|Artificial evolution]] became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of [[Ingo Rechenberg]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] to solve complex engineering problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rechenberg |first=Ingo |date=1973 |title=Evolutionsstrategie&amp;nbsp;– Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution (PhD thesis) |publisher=Fromman-Holzboog|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s in particular became popular through the writing of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=John H. |date=1975 |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn = 0-262-58111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koza|first=John R. |date=1992 |title=Genetic Programming |issue=On the Programming of Computers by Means of [[Natural Selection]] |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-11170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimise the design of systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jamshidi M |title=Tools for intelligent control: fuzzy controllers, neural networks and genetic algorithms |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=361 |issue=1809 |pages=1781–808 |date=2003 |pmid=12952685 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2003.1225 |ref=harv|bibcode=2003RSPTA.361.1781J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arizona flagstone''' is composed of rounded grains of [[quartz]] which are cemented by [[silica]]. Other minerals are present, mostly as thin seams of clay, [[mica]], secondary [[calcite]], and [[gypsum]]. Arizona flagstone is mainly quarried from the [[Coconino National Forest|Coconino]] and [[Prescott National Forest]]s.

Although [[flagstone]] and dimension stone are quarried from all over the state of [[Arizona]], the town of [[Ash Fork, Arizona]], is well known as the center of production and has proclaimed itself "The Flagstone Capital of the World". Extensive outcrops of Arizona flagstone are also found in [[Mohave County, Arizona|Mohave]], [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino]], [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai]], [[Navajo County, Arizona|Navajo]], [[Apache County, Arizona|Apache]], and [[Gila County, Arizona|Gila]] counties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Ate-u-Tiv''' (sometimes written as  "Ate u Tiv" and less popularly known as "Tsun") is a traditional architectural masterpiece of the [[Tiv people|Tiv People]] of the Middle-belt Region of [[Nigeria]] in [[West Africa]].

The word "Atē" stands for the round, open hut; while "Átē-ŭ-Tiv" attributes it to the [[Tiv people]]. The Ate-u-Tiv  serves as a relaxation and reception point for "vanya" (guests) and allows "mbamaren, ônov man angbianev" (family members) to "tema imiôngo" (chat), sharing ideas and telling stories. The "Orya" (family head) receives guests and attend to family issues (discussions) from the "Ate".

To construct a traditional Ate-u-Tiv, you will require a minimum of six poles called "mtôm" which are y-shaped at the top; these serve as the pillars. The total number of poles required will however depend on the diameter of the Ate to be constructed. These are erected upright into the ground in a circle with equal spacing between poles.  Next is "ukyaver" which comprise stems of slim climbing plants.  These are used in constructing a sort of lintel to hold the roof.

The roof of an "Ate-u-Tiv" comprise "ihyange" (paulins) and "ihila" (grass).  The ihyange are woven together in a cone-shape with ukyaver holding together the rafters.  The completed structure is then hoisted unto the [[Column|pillars]]/[[lintel]] with the coned-top upright. Ihila, having been woven together, is then used to provide a thick-layered roofing. This roof filters incoming air making it cool and clean and at the same time stopping the rains.

The [[Tiv people]] are well known for their hospitality and the "Ate-u-Tiv" is an important component of this hospitality. In order to readily receive visitors, each compound builds an "Ate" which is furnished with chairs made from wood, canes, etc.  In modern days, the components of the "Ate" may vary. Some roofs are now a combination of iron roofing sheets covered by grass that may not necessarily be "ihila"; paulins are regularly made of [[plywood]], etc. The "Ate" design now adorns public places such as hotel gardens, public amusement parks, zoos, museums, etc. New usage of the term "Ate-u-Tiv" may refer to a meeting place, social network or forum.

Like [[Tiv people|Tiv]] [[music]], modernization has not changed Tiv [[architecture]], particularly the design and usage of the "Ate-u-Tiv". Ate-u-Tiv has remained a symbol of Tiv hospitality.

In [[geology]], a '''boulder''' is a [[rock (geology)|rock]] fragment with size greater than {{Convert|25.6|cm|in|1}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Glossary2005"&gt;{{cite book | title=Glossary of Geology (5th edition) | publisher=American Geological Institute | last=Neuendorf | first=K.K.E. | last2=Mehl, Jr. | first2=J.P. | last3=Jackson | first3=J.A. (editors) | year=2005 | location=Alexandria, Virginia | page=79 | isbn=978-0922152896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller pieces are called [[cobble (geology)|cobbles]] and [[pebble]]s. While a boulder may be small enough to move or roll manually, others are extremely massive.&lt;ref name="Boulder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boulder|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/boulder|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In common usage, a boulder is too large for a person to move. Smaller boulders are usually just called [[rocks]] or stones. The word ''boulder'' is short for ''boulder stone'', from [[Middle English]] ''bulderston'' or [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''bullersten''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/boulder boulder. (n.d.)] Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved December 9, 2011, from Dictionary.com website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In places covered by [[ice sheet]]s during [[Ice Age]]s, such as [[Scandinavia]], northern [[North America]], and [[Siberia]],  [[glacial erratic]]s are common.  Erratics are boulders picked up by ice sheets during their advance, and deposited when they melt.&lt;ref name="Boulder"/&gt;   They are called "erratic" because they typically are of a different rock type than the [[bedrock]] on which they are deposited.  One of them is used as the [[pedestal]] of [[the Bronze Horseman]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.

Some noted [[rock formation]]s involve giant boulders exposed by [[erosion]], such as the [[Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve|Devil's Marbles]] in [[Australia]]'s [[Northern Territory]], the [[Horeke basalts]] in [[New Zealand]], where an entire [[valley]] contains only boulders, and [[The Baths]] on the island of [[Virgin Gorda]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]].

Boulder-sized [[Clastic rock|clast]]s are found in some [[sedimentary rock]]s, such as coarse [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] and [[boulder clay]].

The climbing of large boulders is called [[bouldering]].

==History and significance==
{{Life timeline}}
{{main|Evolutionary history of life}}
The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted by [[William Buckland]] in the 1840s,&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"&gt;{{cite book| author=Buckland, W. |authorlink=William Buckland| year=1841| title=Geology and Mineralogy Considered with Reference to Natural Theology| publisher=Lea &amp; Blanchard| isbn=1-147-86894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] discussed the then inexplicable lack of earlier fossils as one of the main difficulties for his theory of descent with slow modification through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"&gt;{{cite book| title=On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection| author=Darwin, C| authorlink=Charles Darwin| year=1859| pages=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=324&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 202, 306–308]| publisher=Murray| location=London| isbn=1-60206-144-0| oclc=176630493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian [[fauna]], seemingly abruptly, without precursor, centers on three key points: whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian; what might have caused such rapid change; and what it would imply about the origin of animal life. Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence, based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks.

The first discovered Cambrian fossils were [[trilobites]], described by [[Edward Lhuyd]], the curator of [[Oxford Museum]], in 1698.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liñán |first1=E.|last2=Gonzalo |first2=R|editor1-last=Rábano |editor1-first=I.|editor2-last=Gozalo|editor2-first=R.|editor3-last=García-Bellido |editor3-first=D.|title=Advances in Trilobite Research|year=2008|publisher=Instituto Geológico y Minero de España |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-7840-759-0 |page=240 |chapter=Cryptopalaeontology: Magical descriptions of trilobites about two thousand years before scientific references}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their evolutionary importance was not known, on the basis of their old age, William Buckland (1784–1856) realised that a dramatic step-change in the fossil record had occurred around the base of what we now call the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"/&gt; Nineteenth-century geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Roderick Murchison]] used the fossils for dating rock strata, specifically for establishing the [[Cambrian]] and [[Silurian]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Mark |title=Fossil Focus: Trilobites |journal=Palaeontology Online |year=2013 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1–9 |url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2013/fossil-focus-trilobites/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1859, leading geologists including Roderick Murchison, were convinced that what was then called the lowest Silurian stratum showed the origin of life on Earth, though others, including [[Charles Lyell]], differed. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] considered this sudden appearance of a solitary group of trilobites, with no apparent antecedents, and absence of other fossils, to be "undoubtedly of the gravest nature" among the difficulties in his theory of natural selection. He reasoned that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but that their fossils had not been found due to the imperfections of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"/&gt; In the sixth edition of his book, he stressed his problem further as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles R. |title=The origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection |date=1876 |page=286 |edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can give no satisfactory answer.}}

American paleontologist [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]], who studied the [[Fossils of the Burgess Shale|Burgess Shale fauna]], proposed that an interval of time, the "Lipalian", was not represented in the fossil record or did not preserve fossils, and that the ancestors of the Cambrian animals evolved during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Charles Doolittle Walcott | title=Cambrian Geology and Paleontology |journal=Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections |volume=57 |page=14 |author=Walcott, C.D. |year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier fossil evidence has since been found. The earliest claim is that the history of life on earth goes back {{Ma|3850|million years}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Heinrich D. Holland |title=Evidence for life on earth more than 3850 million years ago |journal=Science |author=Holland, Heinrich D |date= January 3, 1997 |doi=10.1126/science.275.5296.38 |volume=275 |pmid=11536783 |issue=5296 |pages=38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks of that age at [[Warrawoona, Australia]], were claimed to contain fossil [[stromatolite]]s, stubby pillars formed by colonies of [[microorganism]]s. Fossils (''[[Grypania]]'') of more complex [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, from which all animals, plants, and fungi are built, have been found in rocks from {{Ma|1400}}, in [[China]] and [[Montana]]. Rocks dating from {{Ma|580|543}} contain fossils of the [[Ediacara biota]], organisms so large that they are likely multicelled, but very unlike any modern organism.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt; In 1948, [[Preston Cloud]] argued that a period of "eruptive" evolution occurred in the Early Cambrian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cloud, P.E. | year=1948 |title=Some problems and patterns of evolution exemplified by fossil invertebrates | journal=Evolution | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=322–350 | doi=10.2307/2405523 | pmid=18122310 | jstor=2405523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as recently as the 1970s, no sign was seen of how the 'relatively' modern-looking organisms of the Middle and Late [[Cambrian]] arose.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;

[[File:Opabinia BW2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Opabinia]]'' made the largest single contribution to modern interest in the Cambrian explosion.]]

The intense modern interest in this "Cambrian explosion" was sparked by the work of [[Harry B. Whittington]] and colleagues, who, in the 1970s, reanalysed many fossils from the Burgess Shale and concluded that several were as complex as, but different from, any living animals.&lt;ref name="Whittington1979Lawn"&gt;Whittington, H. B. (1979). Early arthropods, their appendages and relationships. In M. R. House (Ed.), The origin of major invertebrate groups (pp. 253–268). The Systematics Association Special Volume, 12. London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Burgess Shale | author=Whittington, H.B. | authorlink=Harry B. Whittington |author2=Geological Survey of Canada | year=1985 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0-660-11901-3 | oclc=15630217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common organism, ''[[Marrella]]'', was clearly an [[arthropod]], but not a member of any known arthropod [[class (biology)|class]]. Organisms such as the five-eyed ''[[Opabinia]]'' and spiny slug-like ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' were so different from anything else known that Whittington's team assumed they must represent different phyla, seemingly unrelated to anything known today. [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s popular 1989 account of this work, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'',&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"&gt;{{cite book| title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History
| author=Gould, S.J.| authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould| year=1989| publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company| isbn=0-393-02705-8| oclc=185746546
}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought the matter into the public eye and raised questions about what the explosion represented. While differing significantly in details, both Whittington and Gould proposed that all modern animal phyla had appeared almost simultaneously in a rather short span of geological period. This view led to the modernization of Darwin's tree of life and the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which [[Niles Eldredge|Eldredge]] and Gould developed in the early 1970s and which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2004EarlySkeletalFossils"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | chapter=Early skeletal fossils

Other analyses, some more recent and some dating back to the 1970s, argue that complex animals similar to modern types evolved well before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AwramikStromatoliteDiversityMetazoanAppearance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FedonkinWaggoner1997KimberellaMollusc"/&gt;

===Dating the Cambrian===
[[radiometric dating|Radiometric]] dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks, have only recently become available, and for only a few regions.

Relative dating (''A'' was before ''B'') is often assumed sufficient for studying processes of evolution, but this, too, has been difficult, because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different [[continent]]s.&lt;ref name="DatingProblems"&gt;e.g. {{Cite journal| last = Gehling| first = James| last2 = Jensen| first2 = Sören| last3 = Droser| first3 = Mary
| last4 = Myrow| first4 = Paul| last5 = Narbonne| first5 = Guy| title = Burrowing below the basal Cambrian GSSP, Fortune Head, Newfoundland| journal = Geological Magazine| volume = 138| issue = 2| pages = 213–218|date=March 2001| url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=74669| doi = 10.1017/S001675680100509X| bibcode = 2001GeoM..138..213G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, dates or descriptions of sequences of events should be regarded with some caution until better data become available.

===Body fossils===
Fossils of organisms' bodies are usually the most informative type of evidence. Fossilization is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by [[erosion]] or [[metamorphism]] before they can be observed. Hence, the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so as earlier times are considered. Despite this, they are often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history.&lt;ref name="BentonQualityFossilRecord"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benton MJ |author2=Wills MA |author3=Hitchin R |title=Quality of the fossil record through time |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6769 |pages=534–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10676959 |doi=10.1038/35000558|bibcode = 2000Natur.403..534B }}

: Non-technical [http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/cladestrat/news.html summary]
&lt;/ref&gt; Also, biases exist in the fossil record: different environments are more favourable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003ExceptionalFossilPreservation"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Butterfield, N.J. | year =2003 | title = Exceptional Fossil Preservation and the Cambrian Explosion | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–177 | doi = 10.1093/icb/43.1.166 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/1/166 | access-date=2008-06-28 | pmid=21680421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, only the parts of organisms that were already [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] are usually preserved, such as the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although 30-plus phyla of living animals are known, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"&gt;{{cite book | author=Cowen, R. | title=History of Life | publisher=Blackwell Science | isbn=1-4051-1756-7| year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marrella (fossil).png|thumb| This ''[[Marrella]]'' specimen illustrates how clear and detailed the fossils from the [[Burgess Shale]] [[Lagerstätte]] are.]]
The Cambrian fossil record includes an unusually high number of [[lagerstätte]]n, which preserve soft tissues. These allow [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] to examine the internal anatomy of animals, which in other sediments are only represented by shells, spines, claws, etc.&amp;nbsp;– if they are preserved at all. The most significant Cambrian lagerstätten are the early Cambrian [[Maotianshan shale]] beds of Chengjiang ([[Yunnan]], [[China]]) and [[Sirius Passet]] ([[Greenland]]);&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris1979"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late Cambrian [[Orsten]] ([[Sweden]]) fossil beds.

While lagerstätten preserve far more than the conventional fossil record, they are far from complete. Because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments (where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly, e.g. by mudslides), most animals are probably not represented; further, the exceptional conditions that create lagerstätten probably do not represent normal living conditions.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt; In addition, the known Cambrian lagerstätten are rare and difficult to date, while Precambrian lagerstätten have yet to be studied in detail.

The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms usually exist long before they are found in the fossil record&amp;nbsp;– this is known as the [[Signor–Lipps effect]].&lt;ref name="Signor1982"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Signor |first1=P.W. |last2=Lipps|first2=J.H. |chapter=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns and catastrophes in the fossil record |editor-last=Silver|editor-first=L.T.|editor2-last=Schulz|editor2-first=P.H. |title=Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the earth |id=A 84–25651 10–42|pages=291–296 |publisher=Geological Society of America |year=1982 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efz87W88HawC&amp;pg=291&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0813721903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phylogenetic techniques===
[[Cladistics]] is a technique for working out the "family tree" of a set of organisms. It works by the logic that, if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A, then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characteristics that are compared may be [[Anatomy|anatomical]], such as the presence of a [[notochord]], or [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular]], by comparing sequences of [[DNA]] or [[protein]]. The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of [[clade]]s&amp;nbsp;– groups whose members are believed to share a common ancestor. The cladistic technique is sometimes problematic, as some features, such as wings or [[Evolution of the eye|camera eyes]], evolved more than once, [[convergent evolution|convergently]]&amp;nbsp;– this must be taken into account in analyses.

From the relationships, it may be possible to constrain the date that lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X&amp;nbsp;million years ago and the calculated "family tree" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved more than X&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged&amp;nbsp;– i.e. about how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived &amp;nbsp;– by assuming that DNA [[mutation]]s accumulate at a constant rate. These "[[molecular clock]]s", however, are fallible, and provide only a very approximate timing: they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the Cambrian explosion first evolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Phylum===
A [[phylum]] is the highest level in the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system for classifying organisms]]. Phyla can be thought of as groupings of animals based on general body plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Valentine
| first = James W. | year = 2004 | title = On the Origin of Phyla | publisher = University Of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-226-84548-6 | page = 7
}}"&lt;cite&gt;Classifications of organisms in hierarchical systems were in use by the 17th and 18th centuries. Usually, organisms were grouped according to their morphological similarities as perceived by those early workers, and those groups were then grouped according to their similarities, and so on, to form a hierarchy.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the seemingly different external appearances of organisms, they are classified into phyla based on their internal and developmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last = Parker
| first = Andrew
| year = 2003
| title = In the blink of an eye: How vision kick-started the big bang of evolution

| pages = 1–4
}}"&lt;cite&gt;Evolutionary biologists often make sense of the conflicting diversity of form&amp;nbsp;– not always does a relationship between internal and external parts. Early in the history of the subject, it became obvious that internal organisations were generally more important to the higher classification of animals than are external shapes. The internal organisation puts general restrictions on how an animal can exchange gases, obtain nutrients, and reproduce.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, despite their obvious differences, [[spider]]s and [[barnacle]]s both belong to the phylum Arthropoda, but [[earthworm]]s and [[tapeworm]]s, although similar in shape, belong to different phyla.  As chemical and genetic testing becomes more accurate, previously hypothesised phyla are often entirely reworked.

A phylum is not a fundamental division of nature, such as the difference between [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s. It is simply a very high-level grouping in a [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification system]] created to describe all currently living organisms. This system is imperfect, even for modern animals: different books quote different numbers of phyla, mainly because they disagree about the classification of a huge number of worm-like species. As it is based on living organisms, it accommodates extinct organisms poorly, if at all.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jefferies1979OriginOfChordates"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1979 | title=The origin of chordates&amp;nbsp;– a methodological essay | editor=House, M.R. | series=The origin of major invertebrate groups | pages=443–477 | publisher=Academic Press | location=London }} summarised in {{cite journal | author=Budd, G.E. | title=The Cambrian Fossil Record and the Origin of the Phyla | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=157–165 | doi=10.1093/icb/43.1.157 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/157 | year=2003 | pmid=21680420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem group===
The concept of [[stem group]]s was introduced to cover evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins" of living groups, and have been hypothesized based on this scientific theory. A [[crown group]] is a group of closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group is a set of offshoots from the lineage at a point earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a relative concept, for example [[tardigrade]]s are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them as also being a stem group relative to the arthropods.&lt;ref name="CraskeJefferies1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Craske, A.J. | author2=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1989 | title=A new mitrate from the Upper Ordovician of Norway, and a new approach to subdividing a plesion | journal=Palaeontology | volume=32 | pages=69–99 | url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf | format=PDF | access-date=2010-12-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824010939/http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf# | archive-date=2011-08-24 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd1996"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Groups that cannot easily be placed in an existing phylum are considered to be [[stem group]]s. A stem group annelid, for instance, is any group that was closely related to, but not within, the crown group "annelida". The stem group split off from the lineage that would lead to annelids, and eventually became extinct.

===Triploblastic===
The term ''[[Triploblastic]]'' means consisting of three layers, which are formed in the [[embryo]], quite early in the animal's development from a single-celled egg to a larva or juvenile form. The innermost layer forms the [[digestive tract]] (gut); the outermost forms skin; and the middle one forms muscles and all the internal organs except the digestive system. Most types of living animal are triploblastic&amp;nbsp;– the best-known exceptions are [[Porifera]] (sponges) and [[Cnidaria]] (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.).

===Bilaterian===
The [[bilateria]]ns are animals that have right and left sides at some point in their life histories. This implies that they have top and bottom surfaces and, importantly, distinct front and back ends. All known bilaterian animals are triploblastic, and all known triploblastic animals are bilaterian. Living [[echinoderm]]s ([[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]], etc.) 'look' radially symmetrical (like wheels) rather than bilaterian, but their larvae exhibit bilateral symmetry and some of the earliest echinoderms may have been bilaterally symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Paired gill slits in a fossil with a calcite skeleton | journal=Nature | issue=6891 | pages=841–844 |date=June 2002 | doi=10.1038/nature00805 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6891/abs/nature00805.html |author1=Dominguez, P. |author2=Jacobson, A.G. |author3=Jefferies, R.P.S. | volume=417 | pmid=12075349 | issn=0028-0836 |bibcode = 2002Natur.417..841D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porifera and Cnidaria are radially symmetrical, not bilaterian, and not triploblastic.

===Coelomate===
The term ''[[Coelomate]]'' means having a body cavity (coelom) containing the internal organs. Most of the phyla featured in the debate about the Cambrian explosion are coelomates: arthropods, [[annelid]] worms, molluscs, echinoderms, and [[chordate]]s&amp;nbsp;– the noncoelomate [[priapulid]]s are an important exception. All known coelomate animals are triploblastic bilaterians, but some triploblastic bilaterian animals do not have a coelom&amp;nbsp;– for example [[flatworm]]s, whose organs are surrounded by [[parenchyma|unspecialized tissues]].

==Precambrian life==
Understanding of the Cambrian explosion relies upon knowing what was there beforehand{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}&amp;nbsp;– did the event herald the sudden appearance of a wide range of animals and behaviours, or did such things exist beforehand?

[[Phylogenetic analysis]] has been used to support the view that during the Cambrian explosion, metazoans (multi-celled animals) evolved [[monophyly|monophyletically]] from a single common ancestor: flagellated colonial [[protists]] similar to modern [[choanoflagellates]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Evidence of animals around 1 billion years ago ===
:''For further information, see [[Acritarch]] and [[Stromatolite]]''
[[File:CambrianStromatolites.jpg|right|thumb|[[Stromatolite]]s (Pika Formation, Middle Cambrian) near Helen Lake, [[Banff National Park]], Canada]]
[[File:Stromatolites in Sharkbay.jpg|right|thumb|Modern stromatolites in [[Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve]], Western Australia]]

Changes in the abundance and diversity of some types of fossil have been interpreted as evidence for "attacks" by animals or other organisms. Stromatolites, stubby pillars built by colonies of [[microorganism]]s, are a major constituent of the fossil record from about {{Ma|2700}}, but their abundance and diversity declined steeply after about {{Ma|1250}}. This decline has been attributed to disruption by grazing and burrowing animals.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals"&gt;

Precambrian marine diversity was dominated by small fossils known as [[acritarch]]s. This term describes almost any small organic walled fossil – from the egg cases of small [[animal|metazoans]] to resting [[cyst]]s of many different kinds of [[chlorophyta|green algae]]. After appearing around {{Ma|2000}}, acritarchs underwent a boom around {{Ma|1000}}, increasing in abundance, diversity, size, complexity of shape, and especially size and number of spines. Their increasingly spiny forms in the last 1 billion years may indicate an increased need for defence against predation. Other groups of small organisms from the [[Neoproterozoic]] era also show signs of antipredator defenses.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; A consideration of taxon longevity appears to support an increase in predation pressure around this time.&lt;ref name="Stanley2008"&gt;

Around the start of the Cambrian (about {{Ma|542}}), many new types of traces first appear, including well-known vertical burrows such as ''[[Diplocraterion]]'' and ''[[Skolithos]]'', and traces normally attributed to arthropods, such as ''[[Cruziana]]'' and ''[[Rusophycus]]''. The vertical burrows indicate that worm-like animals acquired new behaviours, and possibly new physical capabilities. Some Cambrian trace fossils indicate that their makers possessed hard [[exoskeleton]]s, although they were not necessarily mineralised.&lt;ref name="Jensen2003" /&gt;

Burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile, bottom-dwelling organisms.{{Citation needed|reason=try Budd|date=June 2008}} They provide a further line of evidence to show that the Cambrian explosion represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"/&gt;

This new habit changed the seafloor's geochemistry, and led to decreased oxygen in the ocean and increased CO2-levels in the seas and the atmosphere, resulting in global warming for tens of millions years, and could be responsible for mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inverse.com/article/46647-global-warming-animals-cambrian-carbon-dioxide Early Global Warming Was Unexpectedly Caused by a Burst of Tiny Life Forms - Inverse]&lt;/ref&gt; But as burrowing became established, it allowed an explosion of its own,&lt;!--this is carefully worded so as not to imply that was neither a part of the Cambrian explosion, or necessarily different from it&amp;nbsp;– please take this into account when rewording!--&gt; for as burrowers disturbed the sea floor, they aerated it, mixing oxygen into the toxic muds. This made the bottom sediments more hospitable, and allowed a wider range of organisms to inhabit them&amp;nbsp;– creating new niches and the scope for higher diversity.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seilacher, Adolf |author2=Luis A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there seems little doubt that ''Kimberella'' was at least a triploblastic bilaterian animal.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2006"/&gt; These organisms are central to the debate about how abrupt the Cambrian explosion was. If some were early members of the animal phyla seen today, the "explosion" looks a lot less sudden than if all these organisms represent an unrelated "experiment", and were replaced by the animal kingdom fairly soon thereafter (40M years is "soon" by evolutionary and geological standards).

===Beck Spring Dolomite===
Paul Knauth, a geologist at [[Arizona State University]], maintains that photosynthesizing organisms such as algae may have grown over a 750- to 800-million-year-old formation in [[Death Valley]] known as the Beck Spring Dolomite. In the early 1990s, samples from this 1,000-foot thick layer of dolomite revealed that the region housed flourishing mats of photosynthesizing, unicellular life forms which antedated the Cambrian explosion.

Microfossils have been unearthed from holes riddling the otherwise barren surface of the dolomite. These geochemical and microfossil findings support the idea that during the Precambrian period, complex life evolved both in the oceans and on land. Knauth contends that animals may well have had their origins in freshwater lakes and streams, and not in the oceans.

Some 30 years later, a number of studies have documented an abundance of geochemical and microfossil evidence showing that life covered the continents as far back as 2.2 billion years ago. Many paleobiologists now accept the idea that simple life forms existed on land during the Precambrian, but are opposed to the more radical idea that multicellular life thrived on land more than 600 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/death-valleys-first-life-came-in-by-land-not-by-sea/ "Scientific American" April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambrian life==
=== Trace fossils ===
Trace fossils (burrows, etc.) are a reliable indicator of what life was around, and indicate a diversification of life around the start of the Cambrian, with the freshwater realm colonized by animals almost as quickly as the oceans.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kennedy | first1 = M.

===Small shelly fauna===
{{Main|Small shelly fauna}}
Fossils known as "[[small shelly fauna]]" have been found in many parts on the world, and date from just before the Cambrian to about 10 million years after the start of the Cambrian (the [[Nemakit-Daldynian]] and [[Tommotian]] ages; see [[#Timeline|timeline]]). These are a very mixed collection of fossils: spines, sclerites (armor plates), tubes, [[archeocyathid]]s (sponge-like animals), and small shells very like those of [[brachiopod]]s and snail-like molluscs&amp;nbsp;– but all tiny, mostly 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref name="Matthews1975"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While small, these fossils are far more common than complete fossils of the organisms that produced them; crucially, they cover the window from the start of the Cambrian to the first lagerstätten: a period of time otherwise lacking in fossils. Hence, they supplement the conventional fossil record and allow the fossil ranges of many groups to be extended.

===Early Cambrian trilobites and echinoderms===
[[File:Olenoides serratus oblique with antennas.jpg|thumb|A fossilized trilobite, an ancient type of [[arthropod]]: This specimen, from the Burgess Shale, preserves "soft parts"&amp;nbsp;– the antennae and legs. ]]
The earliest [[trilobite]] fossils are about 530 million years old, but the class was already quite diverse and worldwide, suggesting they had been around for quite some time.&lt;ref name="Lieberman1999Trilobites"&gt;{{cite journal

The fossil record of trilobites began with the appearance of trilobites with mineral exoskeletons – not from the time of their origin.

The earliest generally accepted echinoderm fossils appeared a little bit later, in the Late [[Atdabanian]]; unlike modern echinoderms, these early Cambrian echinoderms were not all radially symmetrical.&lt;ref name="DornbosBottjer2000Helicoplacoids"&gt;{{cite journal

These provide firm data points for the "end" of the explosion, or at least indications that the crown groups of modern phyla were represented.

===Burgess Shale type faunas===
{{main|Burgess Shale type preservation}}
The Burgess Shale and similar lagerstätten preserve the soft parts of organisms, which provide a wealth of data to aid in the classification of enigmatic fossils. It often preserved complete specimens of organisms only otherwise known from dispersed parts, such as loose scales or isolated mouthparts. Further, the majority of organisms and taxa in these horizons are entirely soft-bodied, hence absent from the rest of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large part of the ecosystem is preserved, the ecology of the community can also be tentatively reconstructed.{{Verify source|Caron 2006 needs incorporating&amp;nbsp;– see talk page|date=July 2008}}
However, the assemblages may represent a "museum": a deep-water ecosystem that is evolutionarily "behind" the rapidly diversifying fauna of shallower waters.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris2008"&gt;{{cite journal

Because the lagerstätten provide a mode and quality of preservation that is virtually absent outside of the Cambrian, many organisms appear completely different from anything known from the conventional fossil record. This led early workers in the field to attempt to shoehorn the organisms into extant phyla; the shortcomings of this approach led later workers to erect a multitude of new phyla to accommodate all the oddballs. It has since been realised that most oddballs diverged from [[stem group|lineages]] before they established the phyla known today{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&amp;nbsp;– slightly different designs, which were fated to perish rather than flourish into phyla, as their cousin lineages did.

The preservational mode is rare in the preceding Ediacaran period, but those assemblages known show no trace of animal life&amp;nbsp;– perhaps implying a genuine absence of macroscopic metazoans.&lt;ref name="Xiao2002"&gt;{{cite journal

===Early Cambrian crustaceans===
{{Details|Orsten}}
Crustaceans, one of the four great modern groups of arthropods, are very rare throughout the Cambrian. Convincing crustaceans were once thought to be common in Burgess Shale-type biotas, but none of these individuals can be shown to fall into the crown group of "true crustaceans".&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambrian record of crown-group crustaceans comes from microfossils. The Swedish [[Orsten]] horizons contain later Cambrian crustaceans, but only organisms smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;mm are preserved. This restricts the data set to juveniles and miniaturised adults.

A more informative data source is the organic microfossils of the [[Mount Cap formation]], Mackenzie Mountains, Canada. This late Early Cambrian assemblage ({{Ma|510|515}}) consists of microscopic fragments of arthropods' cuticle, which is left behind when the rock is dissolved with [[hydrofluoric acid]]. The diversity of this assemblage is similar to that of modern crustacean faunas. Analysis of fragments of feeding machinery found in the formation shows that it was adapted to feed in a very precise and refined fashion. This contrasts with most other early Cambrian arthropods, which fed messily by shovelling anything they could get their feeding appendages on into their mouths. This sophisticated and specialised feeding machinery belonged to a large (about 30&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref&gt;{{PalAss2007|title=The ecology and phylogeny of Cambrian pancrustaceans|author=Harvey, T.P.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; organism, and would have provided great potential for diversification; specialised feeding apparatus allows a number of different approaches to feeding and development, and creates a number of different approaches to avoid being eaten.&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"/&gt;

===Early Ordovician radiation===
{{Main|Ordovician radiation}}
After an [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event|extinction]] at the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary, another radiation occurred, which established the taxa that would dominate the Palaeozoic.&lt;ref name="Droser2003"/&gt;

Different authors break the explosion down into stages in different ways.

Ed Landing recognizes three stages: Stage 1, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, corresponds to a diversification of biomineralizing animals and of deep and complex burrows; Stage 2, corresponding to the radiation of molluscs and stem-group [[Brachiopod]]s ([[hyolith]]s and [[tommotiid]]s), which apparently arose in intertidal waters; and Stage 3, seeing the Atdabanian diversification of trilobites in deeper waters, but little change in the intertidal realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Landing | first1=E. | last2=Kouchinsky | first2=A.

Graham Budd synthesises various schemes to produce a compatible view of the SSF record of the Cambrian explosion, divided slightly differently into four intervals: a "Tube world", lasting from {{Ma|550|536}}, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, dominated by Cloudina, Namacalathus and pseudoconodont-type elements; a "Sclerite world", seeing the rise of halkieriids, tommotiids, and hyoliths, lasting to the end of the Fortunian (c. 525 Ma); a brachiopod world, perhaps corresponding to the as yet unratified Cambrian Stage 2; and Trilobite World, kicking off in Stage 3.&lt;ref name="Budd, G.E. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Budd | first1=G.E. | last2=Jackson | first2=I.S.C. | year=2016 | title=Ecological innovations in the Cambrian and the origins of the crown group phyla | journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B | volume=371 |  page=20150287 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2015.0287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementary to the shelly fossil record, trace fossils can be divided into five subdivisions: "Flat world" (late Ediacaran), with traces restricted to the sediment surface; Protreozoic III (after Jensen), with increasing complexity; ''pedum'' world, initiated at the base of the Cambrian with the base of the ''T.pedum'' zone (see discussion at [[Cambrian#Dating the Cambrian]]); ''Rusophycus'' world, spanning {{Ma|536|521}} and thus corresponding exactly to the periods of Sclerite World and Brachiopod World under the SSF paradigm; and ''Cruziana'' world, with an obvious correspondence to Trilobite World.

The fossil record as Darwin knew it seemed to suggest that the major metazoan groups appeared in a few million years of the early to mid-Cambrian, and even in the 1980s, this still appeared to be the case.&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"/&gt;

However, evidence of Precambrian Metazoa is gradually accumulating.

Some say that the evolutionary change was accelerated by an [[order of magnitude]],{{refn |group=note |As defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;}} but the presence of Precambrian animals somewhat dampens the "bang" of the explosion; not only was the appearance of animals gradual, but their [[evolutionary radiation]] ("diversification") may also not have been as rapid as once thought.

===The Cambrian explosion as survivorship bias===

[[Graham Budd|Budd]] and Mann&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G. E. |last2=Mann |first2=R. P. |title=History is written by the victors: the effect of the push of the past on the fossil record |journal=Evolution |date=2018 |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=2276-229 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13593}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the Cambrian explosion was the result of a type of [[survivorship bias]] called the "[[Push of the past]]". As groups at their origin tend to go extinct, it follows that any long-lived group would have experienced an unusually rapid rate of diversification early on, creating the illusion of a general speed-up in diversification rates. However, rates of diversification could remain at background levels and still generate this sort of effect in the surviving lineages.

==Possible causes==
Despite the evidence that moderately complex animals ([[triploblastic]] [[bilateria]]ns) existed before and possibly long before the start of the Cambrian, it seems that the pace of evolution was exceptionally fast in the early Cambrian. Possible explanations for this fall into three broad categories: environmental, developmental, and ecological changes. Any explanation must explain both the timing and magnitude of the explosion.

===Changes in the environment===
====Increase in oxygen levels====
[[Earth's atmosphere#Evolution of Earth's atmosphere|Earth's earliest atmosphere]] contained no free [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); the oxygen that animals breathe today, both in the air and dissolved in water, is the product of billions of years of [[photosynthesis]]. Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to evolve the ability to photosynthesize, introducing a steady supply of oxygen into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schirrmeister|first1=B.E.|last2=deVos|first2=J.M|last3=Antonelli|first3=A.|last4=Bagherri|first4=H.C.|title=Evolution of multicellularity coincided with increased diversification of cyanobacteria and the Great Oxidation Event|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=5|pages=1791–1796|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209927110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1791S|pmid=23319632|pmc=3562814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, oxygen levels did not increase substantially in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canfield|first1=D.E.|last2=Poulton|first2=S.W.|last3=Narbonne|first3=G.M.|title=Late-Neoproterozoic Deep-Ocean Oxygenation and the Rise of Animal Life|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=315|doi=10.1126/science.1135013|pmid=17158290|issue=5808|pages=92–5|bibcode=2007Sci...315...92C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen quickly reacted with iron and other minerals in the surrounding rock and ocean water. Once a saturation point was reached for the reactions in rock and water, oxygen was able to exist as a gas in its diatomic form. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere increased substantially afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekker|first1=A.|last2=Holland|first2=H.D.|last3=Wang|first3=P.I.|last4=Rumble, III|first4=D.|last5=Stein|first5=H.J.|last6=Hannah|first6=J.L.|last7=Coetzee|first7=L.L.|last8=Beukes|first8=H.J.|title=Dating the rise of atmospheric oxygen|journal=Nature|date=2003|volume=427|issue=6970|pages=117–120|doi=10.1038/nature02260|pmid=14712267|bibcode=2004Natur.427..117B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general trend, the [[concentration]] of oxygen in the atmosphere has risen gradually over about the last 2.5 billion years.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt;

Oxygen levels seem to have a positive correlation with diversity in eukaryotes well before the Cambrian period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parfrey|first1=L.W.|last2=Lahr|first2=D.J.G.|last3=Knoll|first3=A.H.|last4=Katz|first4=L.A.|title=Estimating the timing of early eukaryotic diversification with multigene molecular clocks|journal=PNAS|date=2011|volume=108|issue=33|pages=13624–13629|doi=10.1073/pnas.1110633108|pmid=21810989|pmc=3158185|bibcode = 2011PNAS..10813624P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes is thought to have lived around 1.8 billion years ago. Around 800 million years ago, there was a notable increase in the complexity and number of eukaryotes species in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Before the spike in diversity, eukaryotes are thought to have lived in highly sulfuric environments. Sulfide interferes with mitochondrial function in aerobic organisms, limiting the amount of oxygen that could be used to drive metabolism. Oceanic sulfide levels decreased around 800 million years ago, which supports the importance of oxygen in eukaryotic diversity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The shortage of oxygen might well have prevented the rise of large, complex animals. The amount of oxygen an animal can absorb is largely determined by the area of its oxygen-absorbing surfaces (lungs and gills in the most complex animals; the skin in less complex ones); but, the amount needed is determined by its volume, which grows faster than the oxygen-absorbing area if an animal's size increases equally in all directions. An increase in the concentration of oxygen in air or water would increase the size to which an organism could grow without its tissues becoming starved of oxygen. However, members of the Ediacara biota reached metres in length tens of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref name="Knoll1999"&gt;e.g. {{cite journal

====Ozone formation====
The amount of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) required to shield Earth from biologically lethal UV radiation, wavelengths from 200 to 300 nanometers (nm), is believed to have been in existence around the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keese| first1=Bob|title=Ozone| url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozone.htm|website=www.albany.edu |publisher=University at Albany| access-date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the [[ozone layer]] may have enabled the development of complex life and life on land, as opposed to life being restricted to the water.

====Snowball Earth====
{{main|Snowball Earth}}
In the late [[Neoproterozoic]] (extending into the early [[Ediacaran]] period), the Earth suffered [[Snowball Earth|massive glaciations]] in which most of its surface was covered by ice. This may have caused a mass extinction, creating a genetic bottleneck; the resulting diversification may have given rise to the [[Ediacara biota]], which appears soon after the last "Snowball Earth" episode.&lt;ref name="HoffmanKaufman1998NeoproterozoicSnowball"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the snowball episodes occurred a long time before the start of the Cambrian, and it is hard to see how so much diversity could have been caused by even a series of bottlenecks;&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; the cold periods may even have ''delayed'' the evolution of large size organisms.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt;

====Increase in the calcium concentration of the Cambrian seawater====
Newer research suggests that volcanically active midocean ridges caused a massive and sudden surge of the calcium concentration in the oceans, making it possible for marine organisms to build skeletons and hard body parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibecbarcelona.eu/novel-evolutionary-theory-for-the-explosion-of-life/ Novel Evolutionary Theory For The Explosion Of Life]&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively a high influx of ions could have been provided by the widespread erosion that produced Powell's [[Great Unconformity]].&lt;ref name="Peters2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peters | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Gaines | first2 = R.

An increase of calcium may also have been caused by erosion of the [[East African Orogeny|Transgondwanan Supermountain]] that existed at the time the explosion. The roots of the mountain are preserved in present-day [[East Africa]] as an [[orogeny|orogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Developmental explanations===
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

A range of theories are based on the concept that minor [[Evolutionary developmental biology|modifications to animals' development]] as they grow from [[embryo]] to adult may have been able to cause very large changes in the final adult form. The [[Hox gene]]s, for example, control which organs individual regions of an embryo will develop into. For instance, if a certain ''Hox'' gene is expressed, a region will develop into a limb; if a different Hox gene is expressed in that region (a minor change), it could develop into an eye instead (a phenotypically major change).

Such a system allows a large range of disparity to appear from a limited set of genes, but such theories linking this with the explosion struggle to explain why the origin of such a development system should by itself lead to increased diversity or disparity. Evidence of Precambrian metazoans&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; combines with molecular data&lt;ref name="deRosa1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Rosa, R. |author2=Grenier, J.K. |author3=Andreeva, T. |author4=Cook, C.E. |author5=Adoutte, A. |author6=Akam, M. |author7=Carroll, S.B. |author8=Balavoine, G. |date=June 1999 | doi = 10.1038/21631 | journal = Nature | volume = 399 |title=Hox genes in brachiopods and priapulids and protostome evolution | pmid = 10391241  | issue = 6738 | issn = 0028-0836 | pages = 772–6|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..772D }}&lt;/ref&gt; to show that much of the genetic architecture that could feasibly have played a role in the explosion was already well established by the Cambrian.

This apparent paradox is addressed in a theory that focuses on the [[physics]] of development. It is proposed that the emergence of simple multicellular forms provided a changed context and spatial scale in which novel physical processes and effects were mobilized by the products of genes that had previously evolved to serve unicellular functions. Morphological complexity (layers, segments, lumens, appendages) arose, in this view, by [[self-organization]].&lt;ref name="Newman2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Newman, S.A.  |author2=Bhat, R. |date=April 2008 | doi = 10.1088/1478-3975/5/1/015008| journal = Physical Biology | volume = 5 | page = 0150580|title=Dynamical patterning modules: physico-genetic determinants of morphological development and evolution | pmid = 18403826  | issue = 1 | issn = 1478-3967|bibcode = 2008PhBio...5a5008N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horizontal gene transfer]] has also been identified as a possible factor in the rapid acquisition of the biochemical capability of biomineralization among organisms during this period, based on evidence that the gene for a critical protein in the process was originally transferred from a bacterium into sponges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Daniel J.|last2=Macis|first2=Luciana|last3=Reitner|first3=Joachim|last4=Wörheide|first4=Gert|title=A horizontal gene transfer supported the evolution of an early metazoan biomineralization strategy|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=12 August 2011|volume=11|page=238|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-238|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/238|access-date=10 September 2014|pmid=21838889|pmc=3163562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological explanations===
These focus on the interactions between different types of organism. Some of these hypotheses deal with changes in the [[food chain]]; some suggest [[Evolutionary arms race|arms races]] between predators and prey, and others focus on the more general mechanisms of [[coevolution]]. Such theories are well suited to explaining why there was a rapid increase in both disparity and diversity, but they must explain why the "explosion" happened when it did.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====End-Ediacaran mass extinction====
{{main|End-Ediacaran extinction}}
Evidence for such an extinction includes the disappearance from the fossil record of the Ediacara biota and shelly fossils such as ''Cloudina'', and the accompanying perturbation in the {{d13c|link}} record.

Mass extinctions are often followed by [[adaptive radiation]]s as existing clades expand to occupy the ecospace emptied by the extinction. However, once the dust had settled, overall disparity and diversity returned to the pre-extinction level in each of the Phanerozoic extinctions.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt;

====Evolution of eyes====
{{main|Evolution of the eye}}
[[Andrew Parker (zoologist)|Andrew Parker]] has proposed that predator-prey relationships changed dramatically after eyesight evolved. Prior to that time, hunting and evading were both close-range affairs&amp;nbsp;– smell, vibration, and touch were the only senses used. When predators could see their prey from a distance, new defensive strategies were needed. Armor, spines, and similar defenses may also have evolved in response to vision. He further observed that, where animals lose vision in unlighted environments such as caves, diversity of animal forms tends to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Parker, Andrew | title=In the Blink of an Eye |publisher= Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | isbn=0-7382-0607-5 | oclc=52074044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists doubt that vision could have caused the explosion. Eyes may well have evolved long before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McCall2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCall | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2005.08.004 | title = The Vendian (Ediacaran) in the geological record: Enigmas in geology's prelude to the Cambrian explosion | journal = Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 77 | pages = 1–229 |bibcode = 2006ESRv...77....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also difficult to understand why the evolution of eyesight would have caused an explosion, since other senses, such as smell and pressure detection, can detect things at a greater distance in the sea than sight can; but the appearance of these other senses apparently did not cause an evolutionary explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====Arms races between predators and prey====
The ability to avoid or recover from [[predation]] often makes the difference between life and death, and is therefore one of the strongest components of [[natural selection]]. The pressure to adapt is stronger on the prey than on the predator: if the predator fails to win a contest, it loses a meal; if the prey is the loser, it loses its life.&lt;ref name="DawkinsKrebs1979ArmsRaces"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Arms races between and within species| volume=205| issue=1161| pages=489–511| date=September 21, 1979| jstor=77442 |author1=Dawkins, R. |author2=Krebs, R.J.| doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081
| journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]| pmid=42057| bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, there is evidence that predation was rife long before the start of the Cambrian, for example in the increasingly spiny forms of acritarchs, the holes drilled in ''Cloudina'' shells, and traces of burrowing to avoid predators. Hence, it is unlikely that the ''appearance'' of predation was the trigger for the Cambrian "explosion", although it may well have exhibited a strong influence on the body forms that the "explosion" produced.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; However, the intensity of predation does appear to have increased dramatically during the Cambrian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1988 |author=McMenamin, M.

Thus the role of predators as triggerers of diversification may have been limited to the very beginning of the "Cambrian explosion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Increase in size and diversity of planktonic animals====
[[Geochemical]] evidence strongly indicates that the total mass of [[plankton]] has been similar to modern levels since early in the Proterozoic. Before the start of the Cambrian, their corpses and droppings were too small to fall quickly towards the seabed, since their [[drag (physics)|drag]] was about the same as their weight. This meant they were destroyed by [[scavenger]]s or by chemical processes before they reached the sea floor.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"&gt;{{cite journal

Mesozooplankton are plankton of a larger size. Early Cambrian specimens [[Filter feeder|filtered]] microscopic plankton from the seawater. These larger organisms would have produced droppings and corpses that were large enough to fall fairly quickly. This provided a new supply of energy and nutrients to the mid-levels and bottoms of the seas, which opened up a huge range of new possible ways of life. If any of these remains sank uneaten to the sea floor they could be buried; this would have taken some [[carbon]] out of [[Carbon cycle|circulation]], resulting in an increase in the [[concentration]] of breathable oxygen in the seas (carbon readily [[Chemical compound|combines]] with oxygen).&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt;

The initial herbivorous mesozooplankton were probably larvae of benthic (seafloor) animals. A larval stage was probably an evolutionary innovation driven by the increasing level of predation at the seafloor during the [[Ediacaran]] period.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001ECR"&gt;{{Cite book

Metazoans have an amazing ability to increase diversity through [[coevolution]].&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt; This means that an organism's traits can lead to traits evolving in other organisms; a number of responses are possible, and a different species can potentially emerge from each one. As a simple example, the evolution of predation may have caused one organism to develop a defence, while another developed motion to flee. This would cause the predator lineage to split into two species: one that was good at chasing prey, and another that was good at breaking through defences. Actual coevolution is somewhat more subtle, but, in this fashion, great diversity can arise: three quarters of living species are animals, and most of the rest have formed by coevolution with animals.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;

===Ecosystem engineering===
Evolving organisms inevitably change the environment they evolve in. The [[Devonian]] [[Colonization of the land|colonization of land]] had planet-wide consequences for sediment cycling and ocean nutrients, and was likely linked to the [[Devonian extinction|Devonian mass extinction]]. A similar process may have occurred on smaller scales in the oceans, with, for example, the sponges filtering particles from the water and depositing them in the mud in a more digestible form; or burrowing organisms making previously unavailable resources available for other organisms.&lt;ref name="Erwin2011a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Erwin | first1 = D.

===Complexity threshold===
The explosion may not have been a significant evolutionary event. It may represent a threshold being crossed: for example a threshold in genetic complexity that allowed a vast range of morphological forms to be employed.&lt;ref name="SoléFernándezKauffman2003AdaptiveWalks"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genetic threshold may have a correlation to the amount of oxygen available to organisms. Using oxygen for metabolism produces much more energy than anaerobic processes. Organisms that use more oxygen have the opportunity to produce more complex proteins, providing a template for further evolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These proteins translate into larger, more complex structures that allow organisms better to adapt to their environments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperling|first1=E.A.|last2=Frieder|first2=C.A.|last3=Raman|first3=A.V.|last4=Girguis|first4=P.R.|last5=Levin|first5=L.A.|last6=Knoll|first6=A.H.|title=Oxygen, ecology, and the Cambrian radiation of animals|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=33|pages=13446–13451|doi=10.1073/pnas.1312778110|pmid=23898193|bibcode=2013PNAS..11013446S|pmc=3746845}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of oxygen, genes that code for these proteins could contribute to the expression of [[complex traits]] more efficiently. Access to a wider range of structures and functions would allow organisms to evolve in different directions, increasing the number of niches that could be inhabited. Furthermore, organisms had the opportunity to become more specialized in their own niches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Uniqueness of the explosion==
The "Cambrian explosion" can be viewed as two waves of metazoan expansion into empty niches: first, a [[coevolution]]ary rise in diversity as animals explored niches on the Ediacaran sea floor, followed by a second expansion in the early Cambrian as they became established in the water column.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Butterfield | first1 = N. J.| year = 2007| title = Macroevolution and macroecology through deep time| journal = Palaeontology| volume = 50| issue = 1| pages = 41–55| doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00613.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of diversification seen in the Cambrian phase of the explosion is unparalleled among marine animals: it affected all metazoan [[clade]]s of which Cambrian fossils have been found. Later [[Evolutionary radiation|radiations]], such as those of [[fish]] in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] periods, involved fewer [[taxon|taxa]], mainly with very similar body plans.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Although the recovery from the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic extinction]] started with about as few animal species as the Cambrian explosion, the recovery produced far fewer significantly new types of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erwin |first=D.H. |author2=Valentine, J.W. |author3=Sepkoski, J.J. |date=November 1987| title=A Comparative Study of Diversification Events: The Early Paleozoic Versus the Mesozoic |journal=Evolution |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1177–1186 |doi=10.2307/2409086 |pmid=11542112|jstor=2409086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever triggered the early Cambrian diversification opened up an exceptionally wide range of previously unavailable [[ecological niche]]s. When these were all occupied, limited space existed for such wide-ranging diversifications to occur again, because strong competition existed in all niches and [[wikt:incumbent|incumbent]]s usually had the advantage. If a wide range of empty niches had continued, clades would be able to continue diversifying and become disparate enough for us to recognise them as different [[phylum|phyla]]; when niches are filled, lineages will continue to resemble one another long after they diverge, as limited opportunity exists for them to change their life-styles and forms.&lt;ref name="Valentine1995WhyNoNewPhyla"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Why No New Phyla after the Cambrian?

| bibcode=1995Palai..10..190V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two similar explosions in the [[Evolutionary history of plants#Colonisation of land|evolution of land plants]]: after a cryptic history beginning about {{Ma|450}}, land plants underwent a uniquely rapid adaptive radiation during the Devonian period, about {{Ma|400}}.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Furthermore, Angiosperms ([[flowering plant]]s) originated and rapidly diversified during the Cretaceous period.

'''Casimir pressure''' is created by the [[Casimir force]] of [[virtual particle]]s.

According to experiments, the Casimir force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; between two closely spaced neutral parallel plate conductors is directly proportional to their surface area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;F=PA.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, dividing the magnitude of Casimir force by the area of each conductor, Casimir pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be found. Because the Casimir force between conductors is attractive, the Casimir pressure in space between the conductors is negative.

Because virtual particles are physical representations of the [[zero point energy]] of physical [[vacuum]], the Casimir pressure is the difference in the density of the zero point energy of empty space inside and outside of cavity made by conductive plates.

Some scientists{{who|date=November 2011}} believe that zero point energy is the dominant energy of the [[Universe]] and that the Casimir pressure of this energy is the main cause of the observed [[accelerated expansion]] of the Universe. In other words, virtual particles drive the accelerated expansion of the Universe.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

[[File:Catalytic triad of TEV protease.png|thumb|360px|The enzyme [[TEV protease]]{{efn|name=TEV}} contains an example of a catalytic triad of residues (red) in its [[active site]]. The triad consists of an [[aspartate]] ([[acid]]), [[histidine]] ([[Base (chemistry)|base]]) and [[serine]] ([[nucleophile]]). The [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] (black) is bound by the [[binding site]] to orient it next to the triad. {{PDB|1lvm}}]]

A '''catalytic triad''' is a set of three coordinated [[amino acid]]s that can be found in the [[active site]] of some [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buller|first=AR|author2=Townsend, CA|date=Feb 19, 2013|title=Intrinsic evolutionary constraints on protease structure, enzyme acylation, and the identity of the catalytic triad|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=8|pages=E653–61|bibcode=2013PNAS..110E.653B|doi=10.1073/pnas.1221050110|pmc=3581919|pmid=23382230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads are most commonly found in [[hydrolase]] and [[transferase]] enzymes (e.g. [[protease]]s, [[amidase]]s, [[esterase]]s, acylases, [[lipase]]s and [[β-lactamase]]s). An [[Acid]]-[[Base (chemistry)|Base]]-[[Nucleophile]] triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for [[covalent catalysis]]. The [[Amino acid|residues]] form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], forming a [[covalent]] intermediate which is then [[hydrolysed]] to release the [[Product (chemistry)|product]] and regenerate free enzyme. The nucleophile is most commonly a [[serine]] or [[cysteine]] amino acid, but occasionally [[threonine]] or even [[selenocysteine]]. The [[Protein tertiary structure|3D structure]] of the enzyme brings together the triad residues in a precise orientation, even though they may be far apart in the sequence ([[Protein primary structure|primary structure]]).&lt;ref name = "Stryer_Ch9"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

== Function ==
Enzymes that contain a catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types: either to [[hydrolysis|split]] a substrate ([[hydrolase]]s) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate ([[transferase]]s). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the [[active site]] of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. [[binding site]] and [[oxyanion hole]]) to achieve [[nucleophilic catalysis]]. These triad residues act together to make the [[nucleophile]] member highly [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.

===Mechanism===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] using a residue as a nucleophile. The reactivity of the nucleophilic residue is increased by the [[functional group]]s of the other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.

Catalysis is performed in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the [[carbonyl]] carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen to accept an electron, leading to a tetrahedral [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]]. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an [[oxyanion hole]] within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting the first half of the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an [[acyl-enzyme intermediate]]. The ejection of this first [[leaving group]] is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.

The second stage of catalysis is the resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=PhD Thesis|last=Thomas|first=Shafee,|title=Evolvability of a viral protease: experimental evolution of catalysis, robustness and specificity|date=2014|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/245207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Triad mechanism.svg|1000px|General reaction mechanism of catalysed by a catalytic triad (black): [[nucleophilic substitution]] at a [[carbonyl]] substrate (red) by a second substrate (blue). First, the enzyme's nucleophile (X) attacks the carbonyl to form a covalently linked acyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by the second substrate's nucleophile (X'). If the second nucleophile is the hydroxyl of water, the result is hydrolysis, otherwise the result is [[Transferase#Reactions|group transfer]] of X'.}}

==Identity of triad members==
[[File:Triad chemical mech.png|thumb|300px|A catalytic triad charge-relay system as commonly found in proteases. The acid residue (commonly [[glutamate]] or [[aspartate]]) aligns and polarises the base (usually [[histidine]]) which activates the nucleophile (often serine or cysteine, occasionally [[threonine]]). The triad reduces the [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the nucleophilic residue which then attacks the substrate. An [[oxyanion hole]] of positively charged usually backbone [[amide]]s (occasionally side-chains) stabilise charge build-up on the substrate [[transition state]].]]

===Nucleophile===
The side-chain of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. The lone pair of electrons present on the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive [[carbonyl]] carbon.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The 20 [[amino acid#Standard amino acids|naturally occurring biological amino acids]] do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult [[catalytic reaction]]s. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the [[hydroxyl]] (OH) of serine and the [[thiol]]/thiolate ion (SH/S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) of cysteine.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; Alternatively, [[threonine protease]]s use the [[secondary alcohol|secondary hydroxyl]] of threonine, however due to [[steric hindrance]] of the side chain's extra [[methyl group]] such proteases use their [[N-terminal|''N''-terminal]] amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

Use of oxygen or sulphur as the nucleophilic atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to [[Nucleophile#Oxygen|oxygen]], [[Nucleophile#sulphur|sulphur]]’s extra [[d orbital]] makes it larger (by 0.4 Å)&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642"&gt;{{cite journal|last = McGrath|first = ME|author2 = Wilke, ME|author3 = Higaki, JN|author4 = Craik, CS|author5 = Fletterick, RJ|title = Crystal structures of two engineered thiol trypsins.|journal = Biochemistry|date = Nov 28, 1989|volume = 28|issue = 24|pages = 9264–70|pmid = 2611228|doi = 10.1021/bi00450a005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and softer, allows it to form longer bonds (d&lt;sub href="thiol"&gt;C-X&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub href="Nucleophile#Oxygen"&gt;X-H&lt;/sub&gt; by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (by 5 units).&lt;ref name="polgár3232"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Polgár|first = L|author2 = Asbóth, B|title = The basic difference in catalyses by serine and cysteine proteinases resides in charge stabilization in the transition state.|journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology|date = Aug 7, 1986|volume = 121|issue = 3|pages = 323–6|pmid = 3540454|doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80111-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="polgár3232" /&gt; in order to achieve concerted [[deprotonation]] with catalysis.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first [[tetrahedral intermediate]] as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to [[protonate]] the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S&lt;sup href="deprotonation"&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Sterically]], the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier [[van der Waals radius]]&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; and if [[mutated]] to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642" /&gt;

Very rarely, the [[selenium]] atom of the uncommon amino acid [[selenocysteine]] is used as a nucleophile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The deprotonated Se&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; state is strongly favoured when in a catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Base===
Since no natural amino acids are strongly nucleophilic, the base in a catalytic triad [[Chemical polarity|polarise]]s and [[deprotonate]]s the nucleophile to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; Additionally, it [[protonate]]s the first [[Product (chemistry)|product]] to aid leaving group departure.

The base is most commonly histidine since its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=G|author2=Wlodawer, A|title=Catalytic triads and their relatives.|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1998|volume=23|issue=9|pages=347–52|pmid=9787641|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[β-lactamase]]s such as [[TEM-1]] use a [[lysine]] residue as the base. Because lysine's p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is so high (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damblon|first=C|author2=Raquet, X |author3=Lian, LY |author4=Lamotte-Brasseur, J |author5=Fonze, E |author6=Charlier, P |author7=Roberts, GC |author8= Frère, JM |title=The catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases: NMR titration of an active-site lysine residue of the TEM-1 enzyme|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Mar 5, 1996|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1747–52|pmid=8700829|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.5.1747|bibcode=1996PNAS...93.1747D |pmc=39852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jelsch|first=C|author2=Lenfant, F |author3=Masson, JM |author4= Samama, JP |title=Beta-lactamase TEM1 of E. coli.

===Acid===
The acidic triad member forms a hydrogen bond with the basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9" /&gt; Two amino acids have acidic [[Amino acid#Side chains|side chains]] at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) and so are the most commonly used for this triad member.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; [[Cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus}} uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} uses [[asparagine]] as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, [[hepatitis A]] virus protease{{efn|Hepatitis A virus protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C3}}}} contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.

==Examples of triads==

On the left are the nucleophile, base and acid triad members. On the right are different substrates with the cleaved bond indicated by a pair of scissors. Two different bonds in [[beta-lactam]]s can be cleaved (1 by [[penicillin acylase]] and 2 by [[beta-lactamase]]).]]

===Ser-His-Asp===
The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif is one of the most thoroughly characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The triad is exemplified by [[chymotrypsin]],{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=S1}}}} a model serine protease from the [[PA clan|PA superfamily]] which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an [[oxyanion hole]] consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.

The same triad has also convergently evolved in [[α/β hydrolase]]s such as some [[lipase]]s and [[esterase]]s, however [[chirality|orientation]] of the triad members is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yueru|last2=Yin|first2=Shuhui|last3=Feng|first3=Yitao|last4=Li|first4=Jie|last5=Zhou|first5=Jiahai|last6=Liu|first6=Changdong|last7=Zhu|first7=Guang|last8=Guo|first8=Zhihong|date=2014-05-30|title=Molecular Basis of the General Base Catalysis of an α/β-Hydrolase Catalytic Triad|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/289/22/15867|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=289|issue=22|pages=15867–15879|doi=10.1074/jbc.m113.535641|issn=0021-9258|pmid=24737327|pmc=4140940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauwerdink|first=Alissa|last2=Kazlauskas|first2=Romas J.|date=2015-10-02|title=How the Same Core Catalytic Machinery Catalyzes 17 Different Reactions: the Serine-Histidine-Aspartate Catalytic Triad of α/β-Hydrolase Fold Enzymes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5b01539|journal=ACS Catalysis|volume=5|issue=10|pages=6153–6176|doi=10.1021/acscatal.5b01539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, brain [[acetyl hydrolase]] (which has the same fold as a small [[G-protein]]) has also been found to have this triad. The equivalent Ser-His-''Glu ''triad is used in [[acetylcholinesterase]].

===Cys-His-Asp===
The second most studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif.&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt; Several families of [[cysteine protease]]s use this triad set, for example TEV protease{{efn|name=TEV|TEV protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C4}}}} and [[papain]].{{efn|name=papain|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}}} The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, with a few notable differences. Due to cysteine's low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, the importance of the Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. [[hepatitis A|hepatitis A virus]] protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain).&lt;ref name="beveridge1355"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beveridge|first=AJ|title=A theoretical study of the active sites of papain and S195C rat trypsin: implications for the low reactivity of mutant serine proteinases|journal=Protein Science|date=July 1996|volume=5|issue=7|pages=1355–65|pmid=8819168|pmc=2143470|doi=10.1002/pro.5560050714}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triad is also used by some amidases, such as [[Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase|''N''-glycanase]] to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The PUB Domain Functions as a p97 Binding Module in Human Peptide ''N''-Glycanase|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|year = 2006|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 16807242|pages = 25502–25508|volume = 281|issue = 35|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M601173200|first = Mark D.|last = Allen|first2 = Alexander|last2 = Buchberger|first3 = Mark|last3 = Bycroft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-His-His===
The triad of [[cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus|Cytomegalovirus protease {{MEROPS|clan=SH|fam=S21}}}} uses histidine as both the acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to &gt;10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.&lt;ref name="ekici2023"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekici|first=OD|author2=Paetzel, M |author3=Dalbey, RE |title=Unconventional serine proteases: variations on the catalytic Ser/His/Asp triad configuration.|journal=Protein Science|date=December 2008|volume=17|issue=12|pages=2023–37|pmid=18824507|doi=10.1110/ps.035436.108|pmc=2590910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual triad is found in seldolisin proteases.{{efn|Seldolisin protease {{MEROPS|clan=SB|fam=53}}}} The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the glutamate carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH.

===Cys-His-Ser===
The [[Endothelium|endothelial]] protease [[VASH1|vasohibin]]{{efn|Vasohibin protease {{MEROPS|clan=CA}}|name=Vasohibin}} uses a cysteine as the nucleophile, but a serine to coordinate the histidine base.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanchez-Pulido|first=Luis|last2=Ponting|first2=Chris P.|date=2016-05-15|title=Vasohibins: new transglutaminase-like cysteine proteases possessing a non-canonical Cys-His-Ser catalytic triad|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1441/1742608|journal=Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=32|issue=10|pages=1441–1445|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btv761|issn=1367-4803|pmc=4866520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Yasufumi|last2=Sonoda|first2=Hikaru|date=2007-01-01|title=The Vasohibin Family: A Negative Regulatory System of Angiogenesis Genetically Programmed in Endothelial Cells|url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/27/1/37|journal=Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=37–41|doi=10.1161/01.atv.0000252062.48280.61|issn=1079-5642|pmid=17095714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the serine being a poor acid, it is still effective in orienting the histidine in the catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some homologues alternatively have a threonine instead of serine at the acid location.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The rare, but naturally occurring amino acid [[selenocysteine]] (Sec), can also be found as the nucleophile in some catalytic triads.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Wolfgang|last2=Wessjohann|first2=Ludger A.|date=2005-02-04|title=The Functional Role of Selenocysteine (Sec) in the Catalysis Mechanism of Large Thioredoxin Reductases: Proposition of a Swapping Catalytic Triad Including a Sec-His-Glu State|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbic.200400276/abstract|journal=ChemBioChem|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=386–394|doi=10.1002/cbic.200400276|issn=1439-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenocysteine is similar to cysteine, but contains a [[selenium]] atom instead of a sulphur. An example is in the active site of [[thioredoxin reductase]], which uses the selenium for reduction of disulphide in thioredoxin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Engineered triads===
In addition to naturally occurring types of catalytic triads, [[protein engineering]] has been used to create enzyme variants with non-native amino acids, or entirely synthetic amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toscano|first=Miguel D.|last2=Woycechowsky|first2=Kenneth J.|last3=Hilvert|first3=Donald|date=2007-04-27|title=Minimalist Active-Site Redesign: Teaching Old Enzymes New Tricks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200604205/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=46|issue=18|pages=3212–3236|doi=10.1002/anie.200604205|issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads have also been inserted into otherwise non-catalytic proteins, or protein mimics.

==Divergent evolution==
The sophistication of the active site network causes residues involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly [[evolutionarily conserved]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Halabi|first = N|author2 = Rivoire, O|author3 = Leibler, S|author4 = Ranganathan, R|title = Protein sectors: evolutionary units of three-dimensional structure.|journal = Cell|date = Aug 21, 2009|volume = 138|issue = 4|pages = 774–86|pmid = 19703402|doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.038|pmc=3210731}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis.

=== Reaction changes ===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate is resolved by water, the result is hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a [[transferase]]. For example, attack by an [[acyl]] group results in an [[acyltransferase]] reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sinapoyltransferases in the light of molecular evolution|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942209002970|journal = Phytochemistry|date = October 2009|pages = 1652–1662|volume = 70|series = Evolution of Metabolic Diversity|issue = 15–16|doi = 10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.07.023|first = Felix|last = Stehle|first2 = Wolfgang|last2 = Brandt|first3 = Milton T.|last3 = Stubbs|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Milkowski|first5 = Dieter|last5 = Strack|pmid=19695650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In different members of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, the Ser-His-Asp triad is tuned by surrounding residues to perform at least 17 different reactions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriou|first=Polytimi S.|last2=Denesyuk|first2=Alexander|last3=Takahashi|first3=Seiji|last4=Yamashita|first4=Satoshi|last5=Johnson|first5=Mark S.|last6=Nakayama|first6=Toru|last7=Denessiouk|first7=Konstantin|date=2017-10-01|title=Alpha/beta-hydrolases: A unique structural motif coordinates catalytic acid residue in 40 protein fold families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.25338/abstract|journal=Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=85|issue=10|pages=1845–1855|doi=10.1002/prot.25338|issn=1097-0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these reactions are also achieved with mechanisms that have altered formation, or resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, or that don't proceed via an acyl-enzyme intermediate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Additionally, an alternative transferase mechanism has been evolved by [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]]s, which has two active sites.{{efn|amidophosphoribosyltransferase {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C44}}}} In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a [[glutamine]] substrate to release free ammonia.

Divergent evolution of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease [[Protein superfamily|superfamilies]] have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This can be inferred when a superfamily (with the same [[protein structure|fold]]) contains [[protein family|families]] that use different nucleophiles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.&lt;ref name="pmid19892822"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Within protease superfamilies that contain a mixture of nucleophiles (e.g. the [[PA clan]]), families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).

The [[enzymology]] of proteases provides some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme [[Superfamily (proteins)|superfamilies]]. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different [[Protein tertiary structure|structural fold]]. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt;

=== Cysteine and serine hydrolases ===
The same triad geometries been converged upon by serine proteases such as the [[chymotrypsin]]{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin}} and [[subtilisin]] superfamilies. Similar convergent evolution has occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral [[C3 protease]] and [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

=== Threonine proteases ===
Threonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or histidine base.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; When the nucleophile of a serine protease was mutated to threonine, the methyl occupied a mixture of positions, most of which prevented substrate binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Leslie A.|last2=Chen|first2=Zhiwei|last3=Gohara|first3=David W.|last4=Vogt|first4=Austin D.|last5=Pozzi|first5=Nicola|last6=Di Cera|first6=Enrico|date=2015-02-24|title=Why Ser and Not Thr Brokers Catalysis in the Trypsin Fold|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|journal=Biochemistry|volume=54|issue=7|pages=1457–1464|doi=10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|issn=0006-2960|pmc=4342846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it ''N''-terminus.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

Two evolutionarily independent [[enzyme superfamilies]] with different protein folds are known to use the ''N''-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold)&lt;ref name="brannigan416" /&gt; and Superfamily PE ([[acetyltransferase]]s using the DOM fold)&lt;ref name="cheng1902" /&gt; This commonality of [[active site]] structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

:''This article refers to the use of computers to estimate losses caused by disasters.  For other meanings of the word catastrophe, including [[catastrophe theory]] in mathematics, see [[catastrophe (disambiguation)]].''

'''Catastrophe modeling''' &lt;ref&gt;See: Mitchell-Wallace, K. Jones, M., Hillier, J. K., Foote, M. (2017) Natural catastrophe risk management and modelling: A practitioner’s guide. Wiley {{ISBN|978-1118906040}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''cat modeling''') is the process of using [[computer]]-assisted calculations to estimate the losses that could be sustained due to a catastrophic event such as a hurricane or earthquake. Cat modeling is especially applicable to analyzing risks in the [[insurance]] industry and is at the confluence of [[actuarial science]], [[engineering]], [[meteorology]], and [[seismology]].

== Perils analyzed ==
Natural catastrophes (sometimes referred to as "nat cat") include: 
* [[hurricane]] (main peril is wind damage; some models can also include storm surge)
* [[earthquake]] (main peril is ground shaking; some models can also include [[tsunami]], fire following earthquakes, and sprinkler leakage damage)
* severe [[thunderstorm]] (main perils are [[tornado]] and [[hail]])
* [[flood]]
* [[extratropical cyclone]]
* [[wildfire]]
* [[winter storm]]
Human catastrophes include: 
* [[terrorism]] events
* [[war]]fare
* Casualty/liability events
* Displacement Crises&lt;ref&gt;See: Edwards, Scott. ''The Chaos of Forced Migration: A Means of Modeling Complexity for Humanitarian Ends''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lines of business modeled ==
* Personal property
* Commercial property
* Workers' compensation
* Automobile physical damage
* Limited liabilities
* Product liability
* Business Interruption

== Input ==
The input into a typical cat modeling software package is information on the exposures being analyzed that are vulnerable to catastrophe risk.  The exposure data can be categorized into three basic groups:

* information on the site locations, referred to as geocoding data (street address, postal code, county/CRESTA zone, et cetera)
* information on the physical characteristics of the exposures (construction, occupation/occupancy, year built, number of stories, number of employees, et cetera)
* information on the financial terms of the insurance coverage (coverage value, limit, deductible, et cetera)

== Output ==
The output is an estimate of the losses that the model predicts would be associated with a particular event or set of events.  When running a [[Mathematical model#Model classifications in mathematics|''probabilistic'' model]], the output is either a probabilistic loss distribution or a set of events that could be used to create a loss distribution; probable maximum losses (PMLs) and average annual losses (AALs) are calculated from the loss distribution.  When running a ''deterministic'' model, losses caused by a specific event are calculated; for example, [[Hurricane Katrina]] or "a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in downtown San Francisco" could be analyzed against the portfolio of exposures.

== Uses ==
* Insurers and risk managers use cat modeling to assess the risk in a portfolio of exposures.  This might help guide an insurer's underwriting strategy or help them decide how much [[reinsurance]] to purchase.
* Some state departments of insurance allow insurers to use cat modeling in their rate filings to help determine how much premium their policyholders are charged in catastrophe-prone areas.
* Insurance rating agencies such as [[A. M. Best]] and [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] use cat modeling to assess the financial strength of insurers that take on catastrophe risk.
* Reinsurers and reinsurance brokers use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of reinsurance treaties.
* European insurers use cat models to derive the required regulatory capital under the Solvency II regime. Cat models are used to derive catastrophe loss probability distributions which are components of many Solvency II internal capital models.
* Likewise, cat bond investors, investment banks, and bond rating agencies use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of  [[catastrophe bond]].

== Open catastrophe modeling ==
Recently, an effort to create and disseminate open multi-hazard cat risk modeling tools was initiated by the [http://www.risk-agora.org/ Alliance for Global Open Risk Analysis (AGORA)].

Also, Oasis Loss Modelling Framework (LMF) http://www.oasislmf.org has been created. It has been founded as a not for profit organisation funded and owned by the Insurance Industry to promote open access to models and to promote transparency. Open source code for the framework is available at http://github.com/oasislmf .

Additionally, the insurance industry is currently working with the [http://www.acord.org/ Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development (ACORD)] to develop an industry standard for collecting and sharing exposure data.  To date, the industry has been operating on closed, proprietary data formats.

[[File:Gay head cliffs MV.JPG|thumb|Gay Head cliffs in [[Martha's Vineyard]] consist almost entirely of clay.]]

'''Clay''' is a finely-grained natural [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[soil]] material that combines one or more [[clay minerals]] with possible traces of [[quartz]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[metal oxide]]s ([[Aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ,]] [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]] etc.) and [[organic matter]]. Geologic clay [[deposit (geology)|deposits]] are mostly composed of [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate minerals]] containing variable amounts of [[water]] trapped in the mineral structure. Clays are [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] due to particle size and geometry as well as water content, and become hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or [[Pottery#Firing|firing]].&lt;ref name="guggenheim"&gt;{{harvnb|Guggenheim|Martin|1995|pp=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University College London Geology on Campus: Clays"&gt;{{cite web|title=University College London Geology on Campus: Clays |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/clay |publisher=Earth Sciences department, [[University College London]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127051002/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/clay|archivedate=27 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science Learning Hub"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is clay|url=http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ceramics/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/What-is-clay|website=Science Learning Hub|publisher=[[University of Waikato]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103182308/http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ceramics/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/What-is-clay|archivedate=3 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soil classification|Depending on the soil's content]] in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red.

Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. [[Silt]]s, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties.  The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. [[Geologist]]s and [[soil scientist]]s usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 [[Micrometre|µm]] (clays being finer than silts), [[sedimentologist]]s often use 4–5 μm, and [[colloid]] [[chemist]]s use 1 μm.&lt;ref name="guggenheim" /&gt; [[Geotechnical engineering|Geotechnical engineers]] distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' [[Atterberg limits]]. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 μm and silt particles as being larger.

Mixtures of [[sand]], [[silt]] and less than 40% clay are called [[loam]]. Loam makes good [[soil]] and is used as a building material.

== Formation ==
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|Deforestation for clay extraction in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The picture is of Morro da Covanca, Jacarepaguá.]]
Clay minerals typically form over long periods of time as a result of the gradual chemical [[weathering]] of rocks, usually silicate-bearing, by low concentrations of [[carbonic acid]] and other diluted [[solvents]]. These solvents, usually acidic, migrate through the weathering rock after [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] through upper weathered layers. In addition to the weathering process, some clay minerals are formed through [[hydrothermal]] activity. There are two types of clay deposits: primary and secondary. Primary clays form as residual deposits in soil and remain at the site of formation. Secondary clays are clays that have been transported from their original location by water erosion and [[Deposition (geology)|deposited]] in a new [[sedimentary]] deposit.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/info/clays/|title=Environmental Characteristics of Clays and Clay Mineral Deposits|work=usgs.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208055734/http://pubs.usgs.gov/info/clays/|archivedate=8 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay deposits are typically associated with very low energy [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environments]] such as large lakes and marine basins.

== Grouping ==
Depending on the academic source, there are three or four main groups of clays: [[kaolin]]ite, [[montmorillonite]]-[[smectite]], [[illite]], and [[chlorite group|chlorite]]. Chlorites are not always considered to be a clay, sometimes being classified as a separate group within the [[phyllosilicate]]s. There are approximately 30 different types of "pure" clays in these categories, but most "natural" clay deposits are mixtures of these different types, along with other weathered minerals.

[[Varve]] (or ''varved clay'') is clay with visible annual layers, which are formed by seasonal deposition of those layers and are marked by differences in [[erosion]] and organic content. This type of [[deposition (geology)|deposit]] is common in former [[glacial lake]]s. When fine sediments are delivered into the calm waters of these glacial lake basins away from the shoreline, they settle to the lake bed. The resulting seasonal layering is preserved in an even distribution of clay sediment banding.&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt;

[[Quick clay]] is a unique type of [[marine clay]] indigenous to the glaciated terrains of [[Norway]], [[Canada]], [[Northern Ireland]], and [[Sweden]]. It is a highly sensitive clay, prone to [[Soil liquefaction|liquefaction]], which has been involved in several deadly [[landslide]]s.

Clays exhibit [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] when mixed with water in certain proportions. However, when dry, clay becomes firm and when [[pottery firing|fired]] in a [[kiln]], permanent physical and chemical changes occur. These changes convert the clay into a [[ceramic]] material. Because of these properties, clay is used for making [[pottery]], both utilitarian and decorative, and construction products, such as bricks, wall and floor tiles. Different types of clay, when used with different [[mineral]]s and firing conditions, are used to produce [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], and [[porcelain]]. [[Prehistoric]] humans discovered the useful properties of clay. Some of the earliest pottery shards recovered are from central [[Honshu]], [[Japan]]. They are associated with the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]] culture and deposits they were recovered from have been [[radiocarbon dating|dated]] to around 14,000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, C. 2005.

Purpose-made clay balls were also used as [[sling (weapon)#Ammunition|sling ammunition]].

Clays [[sintering|sintered]] in fire were the first form of [[ceramic]]. [[Brick]]s, cooking pots, art objects, [[dishware]], [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipes]], and even [[musical instrument]]s such as the [[ocarina]] can all be shaped from clay before being fired. Clay is also used in many industrial processes, such as [[paper]] making, [[cement]] production, and chemical [[filter (chemistry)|filtering]]. Until the late 20th century, [[bentonite]] clay was widely used as a mold binder in the manufacture of [[sand casting]]s.

Clay, being relatively [[permeability (fluid)|impermeable]] to water, is also used where natural seals are needed, such as in the cores of [[dam]]s, or as a barrier in [[landfill]]s against toxic seepage (lining the landfill, preferably in combination with [[geotextile]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Koçkar, Mustafa K.; Akgün, Haluk; Aktürk, Özgür, [http://www2.widener.edu/~sxw0004/abstract34.html ''Preliminary evaluation of a compacted bentonite / sand mixture as a landfill liner material'' (Abstract)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204075553/http://www2.widener.edu/~sxw0004/abstract34.html |date=4 December 2008 }}.

=== Medical use ===
Traditional uses of [[medicinal clay|clay as medicine]] goes back to prehistoric times. An example is [[Armenian bole]], which is used to soothe an upset [[stomach]]. Some animals such as [[parrot]]s and [[pig]]s ingest clay for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== As a building material ===
Clay as the defining ingredient of [[loam]] is one of the oldest building materials on [[Earth]], among other ancient, naturally-occurring geologic materials such as [[stone]] and organic materials like [[wood]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grim|first1=Ralph|title=Clay mineral|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/clay-mineral|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209182021/http://www.britannica.com/science/clay-mineral|archivedate=9 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population, in both traditional societies as well as developed countries, still live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into [[brick]], as an essential part of its load-bearing structure. Also a primary ingredient in many [[natural building]] techniques, clay is used to create [[adobe]], [[cob (material)|cob]], [[cordwood]], and [[rammed earth]] structures and building elements such as [[wattle and daub]], clay plaster, clay render case, clay floors and clay [[paints]] and [[ceramic building material]]. Clay was used as a [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in brick [[chimneys]] and stone walls where protected from water.

'''Climate risk''' means a risk resulting from [[climate change]] and affecting natural and human systems and regions.

In the course of increasing global temperature and extreme weather phenomena
the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has been founded by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) for a better understanding of [[climate change]] and meeting concerns of these observations. Its main aim is evaluating climate risks and exploring strategies for the prevention of these risks.

==Climate risks==
As per current projections of [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] the following future effects have to be expected:
* Continuous increase of temperature
* Cumulation of [[extreme weather]] phenomena
* [[Bumper crops]] and [[crop failure]]
* [[Polar_ice_cap#Earth|Polar cap melting]]
* Changes of the planet’s ecology
* [[Epidemic|Spreading diseases]]
* Attenuation of the [[North Atlantic Drift]]

While affecting all economic sectors, the effect on single continents will differ. Beside these direct physical climate risks there are also indirect derived ones:
* Physical risks
* [[Regulation]]al risks
* [[Litigation]]al risks
* [[Competition]] risks
* [[Production (economics)|Production]] risks
* [[Reputation]] risks

===Physical risks===
Direct risks of climate change are expected especially for branches, which strongly depend on natural resources like [[agriculture]], [[fishing]], [[forestry]], [[health care]], [[real estate]] and [[tourism]]. For example, storms and flooding damage buildings and infrastructure, whereas hot summers with less precipitation cause crop failure.
===Regulational risks===
The governmental endeavours to reduce climate costs have direct effects on economy. For example, the targets regarding emissions within the [[Kyoto-Protocol]] shall be realised by implementing [[emissions trading]]. By this instrument the value of emissions can be quantified monetarily, approximating the value of avoiding hazardous substances. This value shall be internalized by companies and considered in investment decisions. By considering emission costs the prices for i.e. energy and transport can increase and therefore change consumer demand. The insecurity of legislation leads to indefinite adjournation of projects and investments.

===Litigational risks===
Similar to the [[tobacco industry]], industries producing excessive greenhouse gases are exposed to the risk of an increasing number of lawsuits, if damages can be traced back to emissions, i.e. for floodings, crop failure, etc.

===Competition risks===
If companies do not take measures to reduce climate risks they are competitively disadvantaged. This might lead to increasing production costs caused by obsolete technologies and therefore to decreasing profits.

===Production risks===
Production shortfalls can result from direct or indirect climate risks. I.e. [[hurricane]]s damaging oil production facilities can lead to a scarcity of oil and increasing prices. Also the price for energy will rise, because [[heatwave]]s cause [[water scarcity]] and therefore the supply for [[cooling water]] of [[power plant]]s becomes short.

===Reputation risks===
Companies who are publicly criticized for their environmental policy or high emission rates, might lose customers, because of negative reputation. This risk is currently subordinate.

==Climate opportunities==
Besides climate risks also opportunities can derive from climate change for some branches and innovative companies, i.e. for the automobile and renewable energy sectors. Especially energy-intensive sectors can reduce energy costs by using more efficient technologies, which necessarily have to be developed in near future.

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R. Jr|title=The Background of Coleridge's Theory of Life|journal=|date=1954|volume=33|issue=The University of Texas Studies in English|page=60|jstor=20776075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of insect specimens''' is the process of caring for and preserving insects as a part of a collection. Conservation concerns begin at collection and continue through preparation, storage, examination, documentation, research and treatment when restoration is needed.

== Collection ==
[[File:Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay with Ernst Hackel 1866.jpg|left|thumb|261x261px]]
[[Insect collecting]] can be done in many different ways depending on the kind of insects being collected and from which habitats. Both hobbyists and professional entomologist have found particular ways to collect with minimal damage to their specimens. Following established techniques helps begin the conservation of insect specimens from the beginning by eliminating as much potential damage as possible. It must be done delicately to ensure that neither the collector nor the live insect itself will cause harm to the distinctive features such as wings, legs and antennae that give purpose to the collection. Special collection nets, traps and techniques must be utilized in consideration of how easily breakage can happen. A [[kill jar]] is often used to immediately immobilize the insect before it can damage itself.

== Preparation ==
The way an insect specimen is prepared is often the first step in their conservation. They have to be carefully prepared with the appropriate methods depending on their size, anatomy, and potentially delicate features to ensure they will not break before they begin their role as a specimen available for study, research and display. Some specimens must be prepared using a dry method and others with liquid to preserve. The choice made will preserve key features necessary for identification and represent the insect's living form as closely as possible.

=== Pinning ===
[[File:Neduba morsei, female, lateral view.jpg|thumb]]
The process of '''pinning''' insect specimens is a dry method to preserve and display collections and requires special [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|entomological equipment]] to accomplish effectively. It is used primarily for hard-bodied, medium to large specimens and is beneficial for easier study and color preservation. Flies and butterflies, though they are partially soft-bodied, are also best preserved through pinning because when preserved in fluid their hairs and/or scales will either clot or fall off.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 20 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Some smaller specimens may still be pinned use minuten pins, which are much thinner, to avoid breakage. Insects are pinned on foam block or specialized pinning blocks that provide support for the limbs while drying and may be moved to another specialized, protected display case after they have dried completely, at which point they will be more brittle. The pin is most often driven through the thorax of the insect just to the right of the mid-line to preserve the appearance of at least one side should any damage occur from pinning. The exception is butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies, which are pinned through the middle of the thorax.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Enough of the pin must be left both above and below the specimen to allow for labeling below and handling.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StagedandCardedInsects.jpg|left|thumb]]

=== Carding ===
'''Carding''' is used when pinning would destroy too much of the specimen because its size is quite small.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; A triangular point is cut from acid free card to ensure best conservation practice because it comes in direct contact with the specimen. A pin is then driven through the broad side of the point for mounting. A soluble glue that can be removed with solvents when necessary is used to adhere the right side of the thorax of the specimen to the point opposite the pinned side. The point is sometimes bent to allow the specimen to present in the same position as normally pinned specimens.

=== Wet specimen ===
A '''wet specimen''' is a specimen preserved in fluid, often 70% alcohol. Specimens that would receive this preservation technique are usually soft-bodied, such as caterpillars, larva, and spiders because of their soft abdomens. This is done to minimize shriveling allowing the identifying characteristics to be preserved as true to life as possible. Hard-bodied insects may also be preserved temporarily in alcohol before pinning.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slides ===
Slides of very small insects are also kept as part of insect collections.

== Core aspects of conservation ==
The [[American Institute for Conservation]] (AIC) describes in their [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice.pdf?sfvrsn=9 Code of Ethics] the aspects of conservation to include: preventive conservation, examination, documentation, treatment, research and education. Each of these areas also apply to the conservation and restoration of insect specimens.

=== Preventive conservation ===
Insect collections may suffer multiple types of degradation including fading colors from light exposure, mold growth from improper humidity and temperature levels, and infestations from pests that feed on dried insect,&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M Agrilife Extension, (n.d.) [http://bughunter.tamu.edu/preservation/preservationconsider/ Bug hunter: Preservation considerations] Retrieved 2017-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; but much of this is avoidable when proper [[preventive conservation]] practices are followed.

==== Routine cleaning ====
In addition to maintaining a clean storage environment for specimens, it is sometimes necessary to clean the specimens themselves. Cleaning incredibly delicate and brittle dry insect specimens is done carefully and methodically. The conservator chooses the appropriate method based on the kind of insect that needs cleaning and how robust it is. Cleaning tools vary widely, but generally clean watercolor brushes are used to gently dust the specimens, sometimes with a [[stereo microscope]] for very small specimens, warm water and/or alcohol baths used with or without an ultrasonic cleaner, and lens blowers to gently blow away dust, or dry the specimen after a cleansing bath.&lt;ref&gt;Ingles-LeNobel, Johan, J. (March, 2017). [http://extreme-macro.co.uk/cleaning-insects/ How to clean insects] Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proper storage ====
A common way to prevent damage from pests intent to feed on insect specimens and dust accumulation in a collection is to keep them in sealed boxes or cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; When properly sealed, they can also aid in preventing damages cause by [[relative humidity]] (RH)  and temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Szczepanowska, H., Shockley, F., Furth, D. G., Gentile, P., Bell, D., DePriest, P. T., Mecklenburg, M., Hawks, C. Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections. (2013). Effectiveness of entomological collection storage cabinets in maintaining stable relative humidity and temperature in a historic museum building. ''Collection Forum, 27(1-2),'' 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Wet specimens are kept in separate vials or jars and in a secure cabinet, tray or shelf. Fluid levels are regularly monitored to ensure specimens are completely immersed in fluid, though a well-sealed jar or vial will prevent excessive evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Safe handling ====
Proper handling for insect specimens prevents the excessive breaking of legs, antennae and other body parts that could then easily be lost. Curved forceps may be used to allow more precision and less chance of the brittle specimen coming in contact with the handler. The handler picks up the specimen by the pin, which is placed with enough space below the specimen for the handler to put in the pinning block and enough space above to grip without touching the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 11080 Tribolium destructor False black flour beetle.jpg|thumb|156x156px|The flour beetle, a common pest affecting dried insect specimens.]]

==== Integrated pest management ====
'''[[Integrated Pest Management (for museums)|Integrated pest management]]''' (IPM) is a specialized modern pest control used in museums.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R. A., &amp; Allman Gilmore, J. (2010). ''Museum registration methods 5th edition''. Washington, DC: The AAM Press&lt;/ref&gt; All IPM systems begin with regular sanitation and  monitoring of collections to detect castings from various pests, and checking insect traps laid out to capture and identify which pests are present. Some pests, such as carpet beetles and flour beetles, feed on dried insects.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 27 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; When an infestation is present, treatment may be necessary. Freezing is commonly used to rid insect collections of pests.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conservation Institute, (1997), [https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/ccinotesicc/3-3_e.pdf Controlling insect pests with low temperature] ''CCI Notes'' Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[inert gases]] may be used for an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] [[fumigation]] - depriving the pests of oxygen to exterminate, and in extreme cases chemical fumigation proven to be safe for collections and people may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examination  ===
[[File:Isoparce cupressi sjh.JPG|left|thumb|322x322px|Verdigris is present near the pin and an antennae is missing.]]
Assessing the condition of an insect collection is done regularly and the results are recorded accordingly. The conservator observes the specimens in high detail remarking all areas of damage, or altered states of the specimen. Tools used during this process may include a strong light source, magnifying glass and handling tools that allow the conservator to pick up the specimen from the pin without touching it. The observations made during the examination process result in the conclusions drawn for a treatment plan if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, B. (2010). ''Conservation treatment methodology.'' San Bernardino, CA. {{ISBN|1453682112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservator is knowledgeable of the kinds of deterioration to look for specific to insect specimens.

==== Common agents of deterioration ====
* Pests - Evidence of pests are recognized in castings of insects, their droppings or the damages they have caused from chewing on specimens.
* Mold - Mold is most likely to grow when humidity is high. 
* Verdigris - A blue-green hair-like crystallization caused by reaction to copper and brass entomological pins and the fats from the insects internal organs.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentation ===
The documentation of insect specimens is carried out in many different aspects of a specimen's existence. Documented information begins with the capture of an insect. The collector records information about capture method, place and date of capture and any relevant habitat information in field notes. This information is then transferred to labels and collection records. The documentation path then continues with every recorded observation or treatment the specimen receives. Killing agents, preservation agents, rehydrating agents, and fumigants are all important to record.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; This then informs any future decisions for conservation actions.

==== Labeling ====
As a minimum, labels contain the place and date of collection, and the identification of genus and species. On pinned insects, the labels are likewise pinned with the space left under the specimen on the same pin.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways to write the information on labels, but an ink that will not fade or come off in liquid is generally used. The paper is ideally 100% cotton or linen rag to avoid yellowing or embrittlement of the paper as it ages.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 3289 A pinned Australian sheep blowfly.jpg|left|thumb|145x145px]]

==== Photographing and digitization ====
With improvements in [[digital photography]] and web resources, many natural history museums have begun a new kind of documentation through digitization, bringing high quality images and associated information to anyone with access to the Internet. Large databases can hold vast amounts of information improving research efforts.

[[File:Odonata aeshnidae adult.jpg|thumb|Pen and ink scientific illustration of a dragonfly.]]

==== Illustrating ====
[[Scientific illustration]] of insects is an older technique used to preserve information about collected insects. It visually documents insects, and unlike photography, can add intellectual ideas about anatomy and behavior of the insect through artists' renditions. Scientifically informed observation of specimens combined with technical and aesthetic skill yields the highly detailed illustrations necessary for the documentation of each species that is illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, E. R. S. (2003). ''The guild handbook of scientific illustration: Second edition.'' Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Description of the state of the specimen and treatments ====
This area of insect specimen documentation comes after the close examination of specimens by conservators. The conservator records all of the visual information about the specimen that can be gleaned from detailed inspection. Conclusions are drawn from inspection and potential treatments are also documented to inform researchers and future conservators. 
[[File:Life cycle of ticks family ixodidae.PNG|thumb|Researching ticks helps develop health guidelines against the diseases they spread.]]

=== Research ===
Researching the collections of insects provides important information that develops knowledge about ecology, human health and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Well-kept records aid the researcher in identifying whether there are differences in an observed specimen because of damages, treatments or deterioration. Research of the insect collections in museums can lead to new discoveries of species,&lt;ref&gt;Entomology Today, July, 2106, [https://entomologytoday.org/2016/07/12/new-assassin-bug-species-discovered-in-museum-collections-and-in-the-field/ New assassin bug species discovered in museum collections and in the field] ''Entomology Today'' Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; and provide an important historical resource.&lt;ref&gt;Entomological Society of America, Jan. 2016, [http://www.entsoc.org/PDF/2016/ESA-PolicyStatement-EntomologicalCollections.pdf ESA position statement on the importance of entomological collections] Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment === 
Once a close observation reveals what issues are present in insect collections, the conservator makes a decision on actions to be taken. It is highly preferable that any treatment applied be reversible or done with little risk to the specimen. For example, broken limbs may be glued back on, which has traditionally been done with white glue. The advantage to white glue being that it is removable in warm water.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Another common problem is pest infestation. When dried insect collections have suffered an infestation, the affected specimens can be frozen or sealed with inert gases to kill the pests without harming the specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Other treatments might include simply refilling wet specimens' jars with alcohol to ensure the specimens are completely submerged, cleaning specimens of dust and debris, or repositioning specimens for display or research. In the case that a specimen needs to be repositioned, the conservator will "relax" the specimen in a jar with a rehydrating substrate to move the limbs without breaking them. The technique used will vary among conservators. Some use a relaxing jar that the specimen is left in for days with the substrate of choice, others may choose to use a warm water bath with a drop of detergent. Whatever treatments are used are diligently documented.

=== Education ===
Conservation of insect specimens is done in large part to preserve the information for the public. The display of collections in museums and their interpretation offer one avenue that accomplishes this effort. However, websites offer a unique opportunity to disseminate information to a broad audience with layers of information to give general information or to provide depth where desired. These websites are often also provided by museums and their collections. Below is a list of some major educational endeavors with interests in insect specimens.

'''Decomposed granite''' is classification of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] that is derived from [[granite]] via its [[weathering]] to the point that the parent material readily fractures into smaller pieces of weaker rock. Further weathering yields material that easily crumbles into a mixtures of [[gravel]]-sized particles known as [[Grus (geology)|grus]], that in turn may break down to produce a mixture of clay and silica sand or silt particles. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite. It has practical uses that include its incorporation into [[Road surface|paving]] and [[driveway]] materials, residential gardening materials in arid environments, as well as various types of [[walkway]]s and heavy-use [[Trail|paths]] in [[park]]s. Different colors of decomposed granite are available, deriving from the natural range of granite colors from different quarry sources, and admixture of other natural and synthetic materials can extend the range of decomposed granite properties.

==Definition and composition==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Decomposed granite is [[Rock (geology)|rock]] of [[granitic]] origin that has [[weathering|weathered]] to the point that it readily fractures into smaller pieces of weak rock. Further weathering produces rock that easily crumbles into mixtures of [[gravel]]-sized particles, [[sand]], and [[silt]]-sized particles with some [[clay]]. Eventually, the gravel may break down to produce a mixture of silica sand, silt particles, and clay. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite.

The parent [[granite]] material is a common type of [[igneous rock]] that is granular, with its grains large enough to be distinguished with the unaided eye (i.e., it is [[phaneritic]] in texture); it is composed of [[plagioclase feldspar]], [[orthoclase feldspar]], [[quartz]], [[mica]], and possibly other minerals. The chemical transformation of [[feldspar]], one of the primary constituents of [[granite]], into the clay mineral [[kaolin]] is one of the important weathering processes.&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05&gt;Mitchell, J.K., and Soga, K. (2005) Fundamentals of soil behavior, Third edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., {{ISBN|9780471463023}}, pages 200-204.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of clay allows water to seep in and further weaken the rock allowing it to fracture or crumble into smaller particles,&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05/&gt; where, ultimately, the grains of [[silica]] produced from the granite are relatively resistant to weathering, and may remain almost unaltered.&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05/&gt;

Decomposed granite, as a [[crushed stone]] form, is used as a [[Road surface|pavement]] building material. It is used on [[driveway]]s, [[garden]] [[walkway]]s, [[bocce]] courts and [[pétanque]] terrains, and [[urban park|urban]], [[regional park|regional]], and [[national park]] walkways and heavy-use [[Trail|paths]]. DG can be installed and compacted to meet handicapped accessibility specifications and criteria, such as the ADA standards in the U.S.  Different colors are available based on the various natural ranges available from different quarry sources, and polymeric stabilizers and other additives can be included to change the properties of the natural material. Decomposed granite is also sometimes used as a component of soil mixtures for cultivating [[bonsai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Randy|title=Guidelines For Creating Bonsai Soil|url=http://www.bonsailearningcenter.com/IMAGES/PDF%20Files/Soils.pdf|publisher=Bonsai Learning Center|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Joshua|title=Potting Soils for a Bonsai|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/potting-soils-bonsai-70677.html|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diversification rates''' are the rates at which new species form (the [[Speciation]] rate, λ) and living species go extinct (the [[extinction]] rate, μ). Diversification rates can be estimated from [[fossils]], data on the species diversity of [[clades]] and their ages, or [[phylogenetic trees]]. Diversification rates are typically reported on a per-lineage basis (e.g. speciation rate per lineage per unit of time), and refer to the diversification dynamics expected under a [[birth-death process]].

A broad range of studies have demonstrated that diversification rates can vary tremendously both through time and across the tree of life. Current research efforts are focused on predicting diversification rates based on aspects of species or their environment. Diversification rates are also subject to various survivorship biases such as the [[Push of the past|"Push of the past"]]

== Methods for estimating diversification rates ==

=== Fossil time series ===

Diversification rates can be estimated time-series data on fossil occurrences. With perfect data, this would be an easy task; one could just count the number of speciation and extinction events in a given time interval, and then use these data to calculate per-lineage rates of speciation and extinction per unit time. However, the incomplete nature of the fossil record means that our calculations need to include the possibility that some fossil lineages were not sampled, and that we do not have precise estimates for the times of speciation and extinction of the taxa that are sampled. More sophisticated methods account for the probability of sampling any lineage, which might also depend on some properties of the lineage itself (e.g. whether it has any hard body parts that tend to fossilize) as well as the environment in which it lives.

Many estimates of diversification rates for fossil lineages are for higher-level taxonomic groups like genera or families. Such rates are informative about general patterns and trends of diversification through time and across clades but can be difficult to compare directly to rates of speciation and extinction of individual species.

=== Clade age and diversity ===

Diversification rates can be estimated from data on the ages and diversities of monophyletic clades in the tree of life. For example, if a clade is 100 million years old and includes 1000 species, we can estimate the net diversification rate of that clade by using a formula derived from a birth-death model of diversification:

Equations are also available for estimating speciation and extinction rates separately when one has ages and diversities for multiple clades.

=== Phylogenetic trees ===

Diversification rates can be estimated using the information available in phylogenetic trees. To calculate diversification rates, such phylogenetic trees have to include branch lengths. Various methods are available to estimate speciation and extinction rates from phylogenetic trees using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical approaches. One can also use phylogenetic trees to test for changing rates of speciation and/or extinction, both through time and across clades, and to associate rates of evolution with potential explanatory factors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6444">In [[atomic physics]], '''Doppler broadening''' is the broadening of [[spectral line]]s due to the [[Doppler effect]] caused by a distribution of velocities of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s. Different velocities of the [[Spontaneous_emission|emitting]] particles result in different Doppler shifts, the cumulative effect of which is the line broadening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  |title=Lasers
  |author=Siegman, AE
  |year=1986
  |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=1BZVwUZLTkAC&amp;lpg=PA1184&amp;ots=6xdm1N2jLf&amp;dq=doppler%20broadening%20Siegman&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA1184#v=onepage&amp;q=doppler%20broadening%20Siegman&amp;f=false
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This resulting line profile is known as a '''Doppler profile'''. A particular case is the '''thermal Doppler broadening''' due to the [[Kinetic theory of gases|thermal motion]] of the particles. Then, the broadening depends only on the [[frequency]] of the spectral line, the [[mass]] of the emitting particles, and their [[temperature]], and therefore can be used for inferring the temperature of an emitting body.

[[Saturated absorption spectroscopy]], also known as Doppler-free spectroscopy, can be used to find the true frequency of an atomic transition without cooling a sample down to temperatures at which the Doppler broadening is minimal.

== Derivation ==

When thermal motion causes a particle to move towards the observer, the emitted radiation will be shifted to a higher frequency. Likewise, when the emitter moves away, the frequency will be lowered. For non-relativistic thermal velocities, the [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] in frequency will be:

:&lt;math&gt;f = f_0\left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; is the observed frequency, &lt;math&gt;\ f_0&lt;/math&gt; is the rest frequency, &lt;math&gt;\ v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the emitter towards the observer, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].

Since there is a distribution of speeds both toward and away from the observer in any volume element of the radiating body, the net effect will be to broaden the observed line. If &lt;math&gt;\,P_v(v)dv&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of particles with velocity component &lt;math&gt;\,v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\,v+dv&lt;/math&gt; along a line of sight, then the corresponding distribution of the frequencies is

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df = P_v(v_f)\frac{dv}{df}df&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\,v_f = c\left(\frac{f}{f_0} - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity towards the observer corresponding to the shift of the rest frequency &lt;math&gt;\,f_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\,f&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df = \frac{c}{f_0}P_v\left(c\left(\frac{f}{f_0} - 1\right)\right)df&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

We can also express the broadening in terms of the [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\,\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Recalling that in the non-relativistic limit &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda-\lambda_{0}}{\lambda_{0}} \approx -\frac{f-f_0}{f_0}&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;P_\lambda(\lambda)d\lambda = \frac{c}{\lambda_0}P_v\left(c\left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)\right)d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

In the case of the thermal Doppler broadening, the velocity distribution is given by the [[Maxwell distribution]]
:&lt;math&gt;P_v(v)dv = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi kT}}\,\exp\left(-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}\right)dv&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\,m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the emitting particle, &lt;math&gt;\,T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature and &lt;math&gt;\,k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. 

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df=\left(\frac{c}{f_0}\right)\sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi kT}}\,\exp\left(-\frac{m\left[c\left(\frac{f}{f_0}-1\right)\right]^2}{2kT}\right)df&lt;/math&gt;.

We can simplify this expression as

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df=\sqrt{\frac{mc^2}{2\pi kT {f_0}^2}}\,
\exp\left(-\frac{mc^2\left(f-f_0\right)^2}{2kT {f_0}^2}\right)df&lt;/math&gt;,

which we immediately recognize as a [[Gaussian_function|Gaussian profile]] with the [[standard deviation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{f} = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{mc^2}}f_0&lt;/math&gt;

and [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM)

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta f_{\text{FWHM}} = \sqrt{\frac{8kT\ln 2}{mc^2}}f_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

== Applications and caveats ==

In [[astronomy]] and [[plasma physics]], the thermal Doppler broadening is one of the explanations for the broadening of spectral lines, and as such gives an indication for the temperature of observed material. Other causes of velocity distributions may exist, though, for example due to [[turbulence|turbulent]] motion. For a fully developed turbulence, the resulting line profile is generally very difficult to distinguish from the thermal one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Hans R. | last = Griem | year = 1997
 | title = Principles of Plasmas Spectroscopy
 | publisher = University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-45504-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another cause could be a large range of ''macroscopic'' velocities resulting, e.g., from the receding and approaching portions of a rapidly spinning [[accretion disk]]. Finally, there are many other factors which can also broaden the lines. For example, a sufficiently high particle [[number density]] may lead to significant [[Stark broadening]].

Doppler broadening can also be used to determine the velocity distribution of a gas given its absorption spectrum. In particular, this has been used to determine the velocity distribution of interstellar gas clouds. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1936MNRAS..96..661B|title = On the interpretation of interstellar lines|last = Beals, C.S.|website = adsabs.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doppler broadening has also been used as a design consideration in high temperature [[nuclear reactors]]. In principle, as the reactor fuel heats up, the neutron absorption spectrum will broaden due to the relative thermal motion of the fuel atoms with respect to the neutrons. Given the shape of the neutron absorption spectrum, this has the result of reducing [[Neutron cross section|neutron absorption cross section]], reducing the likelihood of absorption and fission. The end result is that reactors designed to take advantage of doppler broadening will decrease their reactivity as temperature increases, creating a [[Passive nuclear safety|passive safety measure]]. This tends to be more relevant to [[Gas-cooled reactor|gas cooled reactors]] as other mechanisms are dominant in [[Light water reactor|water cooled reactors]].

'''Droplet cluster''' is a self-assembled levitating monolayer of microdroplets usually arranged into a hexagonally ordered structure over a locally heated thin (about 1&amp;nbsp;mm) layer of water. The droplet cluster is typologically similar to [[colloidal crystals]]. The phenomenon was observed for the first time in 2004,&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Droplet cluster |journal= JETP Lett. | volume=79 |pages=372–374 | author1=Fedorets, A.A | year = 2004|bibcode=2004JETPL..79..372F |doi=10.1134/1.1772434 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been extensively studied after that.&lt;ref name="R2"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Electrical properties of water drops inside the dropwise cluster |journal= Physics Letters A | volume=376|pages=39–45|author1=Shavlov, A.

Growing condensing [[droplets]] with a typical diameter of 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm – 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm levitate at an equilibrium height, where their weight is equilibrated by the drag force of the ascending air-vapor jet rising over the heated spot. At the same time, the droplets are dragged towards the center of the heated spot; however, they do not merge forming an ordered hexagonal (densest packed) pattern due to an aerodynamic repulsive pressure force from gas flow between the droplets. The spot is usually heated by a [[laser]] beam or another source of heat to 60&amp;nbsp;°C – 95&amp;nbsp;°C, although the phenomenon was observed also at temperatures slightly above 20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="R4"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Expanding the temperature range for generation of droplet clusters over the locally heated water surface |journal= Int.

Due to complex nature of [[aerodynamic]] forces between the microdroplets in an ascending jet, the droplets do not coalesce but form a [[Close-packing of equal spheres|closed packed]] hexagonal structure showing similarity with various classical and newly discovered objects, where self-organization is prominent, including water breath figures, colloid and dust crystals, [[foams]], [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard]] cells, and to some extent, [[ice crystals]]. The droplets pack near the center of heated area where the temperature and the intensity of the ascending vapor jets are the highest. At the same time, there are repulsion forces of aerodynamic nature between the droplets. Consequently, the cluster packs itself in the densest packing shape (a hexagonal [[honeycomb]] structure) with a certain distance between the droplets dependent on the repulsion forces.&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt;

By controlling the temperature and temperature gradient one can control the number of droplets and their density and size. Using infrared irradiation, it is possible to suppress droplet growth and stabilize them for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name="R6"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The use of infrared irradiation to stabilize levitating clusters of water droplets |journal= Infrared Phys. Technol. | volume=75|pages=124–132| author1=Dombrovsky, L.A. |author2=Fedorets, A.A |author3=Medvedev, D.N. | year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the phenomenon, when combined with a spectrographic study of droplets content, can be used for rapid biochemical in situ analysis.&lt;ref name="R7"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Application of a droplet cluster to visualize microscale gas and liquid flows |journal= Fluid Dynamics | volume=43|pages=923–926|author1=Fedorets, A.A | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that the cluster can exist at lower temperatures of about 20&amp;nbsp;°C, which makes it suitable for biochemical analysis of living objects.&lt;ref name="R4" /&gt;

Clusters with an arbitrary small number of droplets can be created. Unlike the clusters with a large number of droplets, small clusters cannot always form a hexagonally symmetric structure. Instead, they produce various more or less symmetric configurations depending on the number of droplets.  Tracing individual droplets in small clusters is crucial for potential applications.  The symmetry, orderliness, and stability of these configurations can be studied with such a measure of self-organization as the Voronoi entropy.&lt;ref name="R8"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b02657 | title = Small Levitating Ordered Droplet Clusters: Stability, Symmetry, and Voronoi Entropy |journal= J.

The phenomenon of the droplet cluster is different from the [[Leidenfrost effect]] because the latter occurs at much higher temperatures over a solid surface, while the droplet cluster forms at lower temperatures over a liquid surface. The phenomenon has also been observed with liquids other than water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2763">The '''Dukhin number''' ('''{{math|Du}}''') is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]] to various [[electrokinetic]] and electroacoustic effects, as well as to [[electrical conductivity]] and [[permittivity]] of fluid [[heterogeneous]] systems. 

==Overview==
It was introduced by Lyklema in “Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science”.&lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J.J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol.2, page.3.208, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-12-460524-4}}.&lt;!-- 10.1016/S1874-5679(06)80006-1? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent IUPAC Technical Report used this term explicitly and detailed several means of measurement in physical systems.&lt;ref name='PAC'&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Delgado |first1=A. V. |last2=González-Caballero |first2=F. |last3=Hunter |first3=R. J. |last4=Koopal |first4=L. K. |last5=Lyklema |first5=J.  |year=2005 |title=Measurement and Interpretation of Electrokinetic Phenomena (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |volume=77 |issue=10 |pages=1753–1805 |doi=10.1351/pac200577101753|url=http://digibug.ugr.es/bitstream/10481/29099/1/DelgadoMeasurements.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dukhin number is a ratio of the [[surface conductivity]] &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; to the fluid bulk electrical conductivity K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by particle size ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{\kappa^{\sigma}}{{\Kappa_m}a}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is another expression of this number that is valid when the surface conductivity is associated only with ions motion above the [[slipping plane]] in the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. In this case, the value of the surface conductivity depends on ζ-potential, which leads to the following expression for the Dukhin number for symmetrical electrolyte with equal ions [[diffusion coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{2(1+3m/z^2)}{{\kappa}a}\left(\mathrm{cosh}\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] into motion of ions within the double layer

:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}.&lt;/math&gt;

* ''F'' is [[Faraday constant]]
* ''T'' is [[absolute temperature]]
* ''R'' is [[gas constant]]
* ''C'' is ions concentration in bulk
* ''z'' is [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
* ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[vacuum]] [[dielectric]] [[permittivity]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity

Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of ''emjoule''s, a unit referring to the available energy consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and in human systems. The recognition of these quality differences is a key concept.

==History==

The theoretical and conceptual basis for the emergy methodology is grounded in [[thermodynamics]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[System theory|general system theory]]&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy. L. 1968. [[System theory|General System Theory]]. George Braziller Publ. New York 295 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name=SysEco&gt;Odum, H. T. 1983.

Odum]] over the first thirty years is reviewed in ''Environmental Accounting''&lt;ref name =EnvAcct/&gt; and in the volume edited by C. A. S.

===Background===

Beginning in the 1950s, Odum analyzed [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] in ecosystems (''e.g.'' [[Silver Springs, Florida]];&lt;ref name=SilverSprings&gt;Odum, H. T. 1957.  Trophic structure and productivity of Silver Springs, Florida.  ''Ecol. Monogr''. 27:55-112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak atoll]] in the south Pacific;&lt;ref name=Eniwetok&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. P. Odum. 1955.  Trophic structure and productivity of a windward coral reef at Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands.  ''Ecol. Monogr.'' 25:291-320.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galveston Bay]], Texas&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;Odum, H. T. and C. M. Hoskin. 1958.  Comparative studies of the metabolism of Texas Bays.  ''Pubi. Inst. Mar.

Division of Technical Information, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. 1600 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others) where energies in various forms at various scales were observed. His analysis of energy flow in ecosystems, and the differences in the [[potential energy]] of sunlight, fresh water currents, wind and [[ocean current]]s led him to make the suggestion that when two or more different energy sources drive a system, they cannot be added without first converting them to a common measure that accounts for their differences in energy quality. This led him to introduce the concept of "energy of one kind" as a common denominator with the name "energy cost".&lt;ref name=FoodProd&gt;Odum, H. T. 1967.  Energetics of food production.  In: The ''World Food Problem, Report of the President's Science Advisory Committee, Panel on World Food Supply, Vol. 3''. The Whitehouse. pp. 55-94.&lt;/ref&gt; He then expanded the analysis to model food production in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=FoodProd /&gt; and in the 1970s to [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name= Congress&gt;Odum, H. T. ''et al.'' 1976.  Net Energy Analysis of Alternatives for the United States.  In ''U.S. Energy Policy: Trends and Goals'',  Part V – Middle and Long-term Energy Policies and Alternatives. 94th Congress 2nd Session Committee Print.  Prepared for the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives, 66-723, U.S. Govt.  Printing Office, Wash, DC. pp. 254–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Man&amp;Nature&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. C. Odum. 1976.  ''Energy Basis for Man and Nature''. McGraw-Hill, NY. 297 pp&lt;/ref&gt;

Odum's first formal statement of what would later be termed emergy was in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Energy is measured by calories, [[btu]]'s, kilowatthours, and other intraconvertable units, but energy has a scale of quality which is not indicated by these measures.  The ability to do work for man depends on the energy quality and quantity and this is measurable by the amount of energy of a lower quality grade required to develop the higher grade. The scale of energy goes from dilute sunlight up to plant matter, to coal, from coal to oil, to electricity and up to the high quality efforts of computer and human [[information processing]].&lt;ref name=AMBIO&gt;Odum, H. T. 1973.  ''Energy, ecology and economics''.  Royal Swedish Academy of Science.  AMBIO 2(6):220-227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1975, he introduced a table of "Energy Quality Factors", kilocalories of sunlight energy required to make a kilocalorie of a higher quality energy,&lt;ref name=NRGQuality&gt;Odum, H. T. 1976.  'Energy quality and carrying capacity of the earth.  Response at Prize Ceremony, Institute de la Vie, Paris.  ''Tropical Ecology'' 16(l):1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the first mention of the energy hierarchy principle which states that "energy quality is measured by the energy used in the transformations" from one type of energy to the next.

These energy quality factors, were placed on a fossil-fuel basis and called "Fossil Fuel Work Equivalents" (FFWE), and the quality of energies were measured based on a fossil fuel standard with rough equivalents of 1 kilocalorie of fossil fuel equal to 2000 kilocalories of sunlight. "Energy quality ratios" were computed by evaluating the quantity of energy in a transformation process to make a new form and were then used to convert different forms of energy to a common form, in this case fossil fuel equivalents. FFWE's were replaced with coal equivalents (CE) and by 1977, the system of evaluating quality was placed on a solar basis and termed solar equivalents (SE).&lt;ref name=NRGAnalysis&gt;Odum, H. T. 1977.  Energy analysis, energy quality and environment.  In ''Energy Analysis: A New Public Policy Tool'', M. W. Gilliland, ed.  American Association for the Advancement of Science, Selected Symposium No. 9, Wash. DC. Westview Press. pp. 55–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied energy===

The term "[[embodied energy]]" was used for a time in the early 1980s to refer to energy quality differences in terms of their costs of generation, and a ratio called a "quality factor" for the calories (or joules) of one kind of energy required to make those of another.&lt;ref name=EnvEdu&gt;Odum, E. C., and Odum, H. T., 1980. Energy systems and environmental education. Pp. 213–231 in: ''Environmental Education- Principles, Methods and Applications'', Ed. by T. S. Bakshi and Z. Naveh. Plenum Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the term embodied energy was used by other groups who were evaluating the fossil fuel energy required to generate products and were not including all energies or using the concept to imply quality, embodied energy was dropped in favor of "embodied solar calories", and the quality factors became known as "transformation ratios".

===Introduction of the term "emergy"===

Use of the term "embodied energy" for this concept was modified in 1986 when [[David M. Scienceman|David Scienceman]], a visiting scholar at the University of Florida from Australia, suggested the term "emergy" and "emjoule" or "emcalorie" as the unit of measure to distinguish emergy units from units of available energy.&lt;ref&gt;Scienceman, D. M., 1987. "Energy and Emergy," in G. Pillet and T. Murota (eds), ''Environmental Economics: The Analysis of a Major Interface,'' R. Leimgruber, Geneva, pp. 257–276. (CFW-86-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The term transformation ratio was shortened to [[transformity]] in about the same time. It is important to note that throughout this twenty years the baseline or the basis for evaluating forms of energy and resources shifted from organic matter, to fossil fuels and finally to solar energy.

After 1986, the emergy methodology continued to develop as the community of scientists expanded and as new applied research into combined systems of humans and nature presented new conceptual and theoretical questions. The maturing of the emergy methodology resulted in more rigorous definitions of terms and nomenclature and refinement of the methods of calculating transformities. The [http://EmergySociety.org International Society for the Advancement of Emergy Research] and a biennial [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231212/http://www.cep.ees.ufl.edu/conference.asp International Conference] at the University of Florida support this research.

==Definitions and examples==

'''''Emergy'''''— amount of energy of one form that is used in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The unit of emergy is the '''emjoule''' or emergy joule. Using emergy, sunlight, fuel, electricity, and human service can be put on a common basis by expressing each of them in the emjoules of solar energy that is required to produce them. If solar emergy is the baseline, then the results are solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ). Although other baselines have been used, such as coal emjoules or electrical emjoules, in most cases emergy data are given in solar emjoules.

'''''Unit Emergy Values (UEVs)''''' — the emergy required to generate one unit of output. Types of UEVs:
:'''''Transformity''''' — emergy input per unit of available energy output. For example, if 10,000 solar emjoules are required to generate a joule of wood, then the solar transformity of that wood is 10,000 solar emjoules per joule (abbreviated seJ/J). The solar transformity of the sunlight absorbed by the earth is 1.0 by definition.

:'''''Specific emergy''''' — emergy per unit mass output. Specific emergy is usually expressed as solar emergy per gram (seJ/g). Because energy is required to concentrate materials, the unit emergy value of any substance increases with concentration. Elements and compounds not abundant in nature therefore have higher emergy/mass ratios when found in concentrated form since more environmental work is required to concentrate them, both spatially and chemically.

:'''''Emergy per unit money''''' — the emergy supporting the generation of one unit of economic product (expressed in monetary terms)''.'' It is used to convert money into emergy units. Since money is paid for goods and services, but not to the environment, the contribution to a process represented by monetary payments is the emergy that money purchases. The amount of resources that money buys depends on the amount of emergy supporting the economy and the amount of money circulating. An average emergy/money ratio in solar emjoules/$ can be calculated by dividing the total emergy use of a state or nation by its gross economic product. It varies by country and has been shown to decrease each year, which is one index of inflation. This emergy/money ratio is useful for evaluating service inputs given in money units where an average wage rate is appropriate.

:'''''Emergy per unit labor''''' — the emergy supporting one unit of direct labor applied to a process''.'' Workers apply their efforts to a process and in so doing they indirectly invest in it the emergy that made their labor possible (food, training, transport, etc). This emergy intensity is generally expressed as emergy per time (seJ/yr; seJ/hr), but emergy per money earned (seJ/$) is also used. Indirect labor required to make and supply the inputs to a process is generally measured with the dollar cost of services, so that its emergy intensity is calculated as seJ/$.

:'''''Empower''''' — a flow of emergy (i.e., emergy per unit time)''.''

==Accounting method==

Emergy accounting converts the thermodynamic basis of all forms of energy, resources and human services into equivalents of a single form of energy, usually solar. To evaluate a system, a system diagram organizes the evaluation and account for energy inputs and outflows. A table of the flows of resources, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram and all flows are evaluated. The final step involves interpreting the results.&lt;ref name=EnvAcct /&gt;

===Purpose===

In some cases, an evaluation is done to determine the fit of a development proposal within its environment. It also allows comparison of alternatives. Another purpose is to seek the best use of resources to maximize economic vitality.

===Systems diagram===

[[File:Systems diagram of a city.png|thumb|alt=A systems diagram of a city embedded in its support region showing the environmental energy and non renewable energy sources that drive the region and city system|'''Figure 1''': Energy system diagram of a city in its support region]]
System diagrams show the inputs that are evaluated and summed to obtain the emergy of a flow. A diagram of a city and its regional support area is shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref&gt;Many example diagrams can be found at [http://emergysystems.org/symbols.php EmergySystems.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309041649/http://www.emergysystems.org/symbols.php |date=2010-03-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation table===

A table (see example below) of resource flows, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram. Raw data on inflows that cross the boundary are converted into emergy units, and then summed to obtain total emergy supporting the system. Energy flows per unit time (usually per year) are presented in the table as separate line items.

*Column # 4 shows the units for each raw data item.

*Column # 6 is the solar emergy of a given flow, calculated as the raw input times the UEV (Column 3 times Column 5).

All tables are followed by footnotes that show citations for data and calculations.

===Calculating unit values===

The table allows a unit emergy value to be calculated. The final, output row (row “O” in the example table above) is evaluated first in units of energy or mass. Then the input emergy is summed and the unit emergy value is calculated by dividing the emergy by the units of the output.

===Performance indicators===

[[File:EmergyRatios5.png|thumb|alt=a basic diagram showing an economic progress that draws resources from the environment that are both renewable and non renewable energies and feedbacks from the main economy.|'''Figure 2''': Systems diagram showing flows used in the performance indicator ratios]]
Figure 2 shows non-renewable environmental contributions (N) as an emergy storage of materials, renewable environmental inputs (R), and inputs from the economy as purchased (F) goods and services. Purchased inputs are needed for the process to take place and include human service and purchased non-renewable energy and material brought in from elsewhere (fuels, minerals, electricity, machinery, fertilizer, etc.). Several ratios, or indices are given in Figure 2 that assess the global performance of a process.
* '''Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) —''' Emergy released (used up) per unit invested. The ratio is a measure of how much an investment enables a process to exploit local resources.
* '''Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR''') — The ratio of nonrenewable and imported emergy use to renewable emergy use. It is an indicator of the pressure a transformation process exerts on the environment and can be considered a measure of [[ecosystem]] stress due to a production (transformation activity.
* '''Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI''') — The ratio of EYR to ELR. It measures the contribution of a resource or process to the economy per unit of environmental loading.
* '''Areal Empower Intensity —''' The ratio of emergy use in the economy of a region to its area. Renewable and nonrenewable emergy density are calculated separately by dividing the total renewable emergy by area and the total nonrenewable emergy by area, respectively.

Other ratios are useful depending on the type and scale of the system under evaluation.
* '''Percent Renewable Emergy (%Ren''') — The ratio of renewable emergy to total emergy use. In the long run, only processes with high %Ren are sustainable.
* '''Emprice'''. The emprice of a commodity is the emergy one receives for the money spent in sej/$.
* '''Emergy Exchange Ratio (EER''') — The ratio of emergy exchanged in a trade or purchase (what is received to what is given). The ratio is always expressed relative to a trading partner and is a measure of the relative trade advantage of one partner over the other.
* '''Emergy per capita —''' The ratio of emergy use of a region or nation to the population. Emergy per capita can be used as a measure of potential, average standard of living of the population.
* '''Emergy-based energy return on investment''' was introduced as a way to bridge and improve the concept of [[Energy returned on energy invested]] to also include environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y.|last2=Feng|first2=L.|last3=Wang|first3=J.|last4=Höök|first4=M|title=Emergy-based energy return on investment method for evaluating energy exploitation|journal=Energy|date=2017|volume=128|issue=6|pages=540–549|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The recognition of the relevance of energy to the growth and dynamics of [[complex systems]] has resulted in increased emphasis on  environmental evaluation methods that can account for and interpret the effects of matter and energy flows at all scales in systems of humanity and nature. The following table lists some general areas in which the emergy methodology has been employed.

==Controversies==

The concept of emergy has been controversial within academe including ecology, thermodynamics and economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U., 1998. Ecology vs. Economics: Confusing Production and Consumption. Center of the Management of Environmental Resources, INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, C.J., Kaufmann, R.K., Stern, D.I., 2000. Aggregation and the role of energy in the economy. Ecol. Econ. 32, 301–317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hau JL, Bakshi BR. 2004. Promise and problems of emergy analysis. Ecological Modelling 178:215–225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansson, B.A., McGlade, J.M., 1993. Ecology, thermodynamics and H.T. Odum’s conjectures. Oecologia 93, 582–596.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silvert W. 1982. The theory of power and efficiency in ecology. Ecological Modelling 15:159–164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spreng, D.T., 1988. Net-Energy Analysis and the Energy Requirements of Energy Systems. Praeger Publishers, New York, 289 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergy theory has been criticized for allegedly offering an energy theory of value to replace other [[Labor theory of value|theories of value]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} The stated goal of emergy evaluations is to provide an "ecocentric" valuation of systems, processes. Thus it does not purport to replace economic values but to provide additional information, from a different point of view.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The idea that a [[calorie]] of sunlight is not equivalent to a calorie of fossil fuel or electricity strikes many as absurd, based on the [[Newton's laws of motion|1st Law]] definition of energy units as measures of heat (i.e. Joule's [[mechanical equivalent of heat]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sciubba, E., 2010. On the Second-Law inconsistency of Emergy Analysis. Energy 35, 3696-3706.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have rejected the concept as impractical since from their perspective it is impossible to objectively quantify the amount of sunlight that is required to produce a quantity of oil. In combining systems of humanity and nature and evaluating environmental input to economies, mainstream economists criticize the emergy methodology for disregarding market values.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3864">'''Energoland''' is an information centre for energy and electricity generation which was opened by [[Slovenské elektrárne]] on 14 October 2014 at [[Mochovce]], [[Slovakia]], at the site of the nuclear power plant. It is situated between Levice and Nitra. The centre mainly serves the schools and public. The entry is free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/reservations&lt;/ref&gt; The exposition was awarded as an excellent communication project at the PIME conference and evaluated as a five-star training centre by Laura Elizabeth Kennedy, governor of the United States of America in the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and chargé d'affaires of permanent representation of the USA in international organisation in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/iaea-governor-energoland-is-a-5-star-education-centre/156&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exposition ==
In Energoland, there are more than thirty objects, applications, and interactive expositions. Edutainment (blending education and entertainment) at Mochovce offers information on energy, electricity generation, global warming, and carbon burden. In addition, visitors learn about the energy mix, electricity grid dispatching, or about the radiation around us. The exposition also focuses on power industry, not only with respect to safety and radioactive waste but also dealing with the fuel cycle, nanowolrd of atoms, and Cherenkov radiation. Some of the specialities include the 3D cinema with its own movie Energy Odyssey, a model of emission-free motorcycle, interactive LED floor or thermal mirror, and mobile application using augmented reality, "Energoland",&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.sk.strategic.EnergolandAR&lt;/ref&gt; downloadable from Google Play or AppStore. Through the Energy Map, various facts and statistics can be searched which are directly shown in the map of the world with the highlighted countries.
Energoland also wants its visitors to make their own opinion of the electricity generation and its sources. Therefore, it does not provide information only about nuclear energy but it also brings knowledge about other sources: water, sun, wind, geothermal energy, or fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/exposition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/energoland-opened-by-slovenske-elektrarne/119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/gallery/energoland-new-dimension-of-entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of Energoland ==
The design of the building is the work of Ing. arch. Viktor Šabík (BARAK Architekti) who, together with the QEX Company and Italian agency Piter Design, designed the interior of Energoland, as well.[2] The total area of the building, including the training rooms and offices is 2,000 square metres; the info centre itself takes up the area of 600 m2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/data/education/126/file/cfakepathe-atom-10-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Activities ==
Energoland is not only a visitor and information centre; it also serves as a training centre for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne and provides office areas. There are many events for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne or public taking place here, such as the 90 reactor-years anniversary,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/90-reaktorrokov-jadrovych-blokov-slovenskych-elektrarni/140&lt;/ref&gt; programme within the national round of Olympics in Physics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/mladi-fyzici-na-olympiade-v-atomovej-elektrarni/162&lt;/ref&gt; Science Talks during the Science and Technology Week,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/slovenske-elektrarne-hlavnym-partnerom-tvt/130&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable Development Conference in May 2015, etc.

'''Frequency-dependent selection''' is an evolutionary process by which the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of a [[phenotype]] depends on its frequency relative to other phenotypes in a given [[population]].

* In '''positive''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common.
* In '''negative''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype decreases as it becomes more common. This is an example of [[balancing selection]].

Frequency-dependent selection is usually the result of interactions between species (predation, parasitism, or competition), or between genotypes within species (usually competitive or symbiotic), and has been especially frequently discussed with relation to [[anti-predator adaptations]]. Frequency-dependent selection can lead to [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] equilibria, which result from interactions among genotypes within species, in the same way that multi-species equilibria require interactions between species in competition (e.g. where ''α''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; parameters in [[Lotka-Volterra]] competition equations are non-zero).

[[File:The anvil stone of a thrush - geograph.org.uk - 1751348.jpg|thumb|Anvil stone, where a thrush has broken open the shells of polymorphic [[grove snail]]s, may be a sign of frequency-dependent selection.]]

The first explicit statement of frequency-dependent selection appears to have been by [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] in 1884, on the way that predators could maintain color polymorphisms in their prey.&lt;ref&gt;Poulton, E. B. 1884. Notes upon, or suggested by, the colours, markings and protective attitudes of certain lepidopterous larvae and pupae, and of a phytophagous hymenopterous larva. Transactions of the Entomological Society of London 1884: 27–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Clarke | first2 = B.C. | year = 1984 | title = Frequency-dependent selection -- homage to Poulton, E.B | url = | journal = Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 15–18 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00802.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known early modern statement of the principle is [[Bryan Clarke]]'s 1962 paper on [[apostatic selection]] (a synonym of negative frequency-dependent selection).&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B. 1962. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species. Pp. 47-70 in D. Nichols ed. Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke discussed predator attacks on polymorphic British snails, citing [[Luuk Tinbergen]]'s classic work on [[searching image]]s as support that predators such as birds tended to specialize in common forms of palatable species.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, L. 1960. The natural control of insects in pinewoods. I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation in songbirds. Archs.Neerl.Zool. 13:265-343.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke later argued that frequency-dependent balancing selection could explain molecular polymorphisms (often in the absence of [[heterosis]]) in opposition to the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]].

Another example is [[plant self-incompatibility]] [[allele]]s. When two plants share the same incompatibility allele, they are unable to mate. Thus, a plant with a new (and therefore, rare) allele has more success at mating, and its allele spreads quickly through the population {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

In human pathogens, such as the [[flu]] virus, once a particular strain has become common, most individuals have developed an immune response to that strain. But a rare, novel strain of the flu virus is able to spread quickly to almost any individual, causing continual evolution of viral strains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) is involved in the recognition of foreign antigens and cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takahata | first1 = N. | last2 = Nei | first2 = M. | date = 1990 | title = Allelic genealogy under overdominant and frequency-dependent selection and polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex loci | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 124 | issue = | pages = 967–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequency-dependent selection may explain the high degree of polymorphism in the MHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borghans | first1 = JA | last2 = Beltman | first2 = JB | last3 = De Boer | first3 = RJ. |date=Feb 2004 | title = MHC polymorphism under host-pathogen coevolution. | url = | journal = Immunogenetics | volume = 55 | issue = 11| pages = 732–9 | doi=10.1007/s00251-003-0630-5 | pmid=14722687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavioral ecology]], negative frequency-dependent selection often maintains multiple behavioral strategies within a species. A classic example is the Hawk-Dove model of interactions among individuals in a population. In a population with two traits A and B, being one form is better when most members are the other form.  As another example, male [[common side-blotched lizard]]s have three morphs, which either defend large territories and maintain large harems of females, defend smaller territories and keep one female, or mimic females in order to sneak matings from the other two morphs. These three morphs participate in a [[rock paper scissors]] sort of interaction such that no one morph completely outcompetes the other two.&lt;ref name="S&amp;L1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinervo |first=B. |author2=C.M. Lively |date=1996 |title=The rock–paper–scissors game and the evolution of alternative male strategies |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6571 |pages=240–243 |doi=10.1038/380240a0|bibcode=1996Natur.380..240S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Setal2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinervo |first=Barry |author2=Donald B.

[[File:Müllerian mimicry among Heliconius species.tiff|thumb|Müllerian mimetic species of ''Heliconius'' from South America]]

Positive frequency-dependent selection gives an advantage to common phenotypes. A good example is warning coloration in aposematic species.  Predators are more likely to remember a common color pattern that they have already encountered frequently than one that is rare. This means that new mutants or migrants that have color patterns other than the common type are eliminated from the population by differential predation.  Positive frequency-dependent selection provides the basis for Müllerian mimicry, as described by Fritz Müller &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Müller, F. |authorlink=Fritz Müller |year=1879 |title=Ituna and Thyridia; a remarkable case of mimicry in butterflies |journal=Proceedings of the Entomological Society of London |pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, because all species involved are aposematic and share the benefit of a common, honest signal to potential predators.

Another, rather complicated example occurs in the [[Batesian mimicry]] complex between a harmless mimic, the scarlet kingsnake (''[[Lampropeltis elapsoides]]''), and the model, the eastern coral snake (''[[Micrurus fulvius]]''), in locations where the model and mimic were in deep [[sympatry]], the [[phenotype]] of the scarlet kingsnake was quite variable due to relaxed selection. But where the pattern was rare, the predator population was not 'educated', so the pattern brought no benefit. The scarlet kingsnake was much less variable on the allopatry/sympatry border of the model and mimic, most probably due to increased selection since the eastern coral snake is rare, but present, on this border. Therefore, the coloration is only advantageous once it has become common.&lt;ref name="Harper 1955–1961"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harper |first=G. R. |author2=Pfennig, D. W. |title=Mimicry on the edge: why do mimics vary in resemblance to their model in different parts of their geographical range? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=22 August 2007 |volume=274 |issue=1621 |pages=1955–1961 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0558 |pmid=17567563 |pmc=2275182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five main [[latitude]] regions of the Earth's surface comprise '''geographical zones''', divided by the major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]]. The differences between them relate to [[climate]]. They are as follows: 

#The [[Arctic|North frigid zone]], between the [[Arctic Circle]] 66.5° N and the [[North Pole]] 90° N. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.
#The [[North temperate zone]], between the  [[Tropic of Cancer]] 23.5° N and the Arctic Circle 66.5° N. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Tropics|Torrid zone]], between the Tropic of Cancer 23.5° N and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] 23.5° S. Covers 39.78% of Earth's surface.
#The [[South temperate zone]], between the Tropic of Capricorn 23.5° S and the [[Antarctic Circle]] 66.5° S. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Antarctic|South frigid zone]], from Antarctic Circle 66.5° S and the [[South Pole]] 90° S. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.

On the basis of latitudinal extent, the globe is divided into three broad heat zones.

==Torrid Zone==

The Torrid is also known as the [[Tropics]]. The zone is bounded on the north by the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the south by the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]; these latitudes mark the northern and southern extremes in which the sun seasonally passes directly overhead. This happens annually, but in the region between, the sun passes overhead twice a year.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in the sun's apparent northward migration after the March [[equinox]], it passes overhead once, then after the [[June solstice]], at which time it reaches the [[Tropic of Cancer]], it passes over again on its apparent southward journey. After the September equinox the sun passes into the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It then passes similarly over the southern tropical regions until it reaches the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] at the [[December solstice]], and back again as it returns northwards to the [[Equator]].

==Temperate Zones==

In the two Temperate Zones also known as tropical zone not, consisting of the [[tepid]] [[latitudes]], the Sun is never directly overhead, and the climate is mild, generally ranging from warm to cool. The four annual seasons, [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]], occur in these areas. The North Temperate Zone includes [[Europe]], [[Northern Asia]], and [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]. The South Temperate Zone includes Southern [[Australasia]], southern [[South America]], and [[Southern Africa]].

==Frigid Zones==

The two Frigid Zones, or [[polar regions of Earth|polar region]]s, experience the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]] for part of the year - at the edge of the zone there is one day at the winter solstice when the Sun is invisible, and one day at the summer solstice when the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours. In the center of the zone (the [[Geographical pole|pole]]) the day is one year long with six months of daylight and six months of night. The Frigid Zones are the coldest regions of Earth and are generally covered in ice and snow.It receives slanting rays of the sun as this region lies farthest from the equator. Summer season in this region lies lasts for about 2 to 3 months and there is almost 24 hour sunlight during summer.

==History==
The concept of a geographical zone was first hypothesized by the ancient Greek scholar [[Parmenides]]&lt;ref&gt;Strab. 2,2,1-2 in: A. H. Coxon and R. D. McKirahan (eds), The Fragments of Parmenides: A Critical Text With Introduction, and Translation, the Ancient Testimonia and a Commentary, 2nd edn (Phronesis: Supplementary Volumes 3; Assen, Dover (NH), 2009), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and lastingly modified by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]], [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Bekker numbers|Bekker numbers]] 362a33-362b29&lt;/ref&gt; Both philosophers theorized the Earth divided into three types of climatic zones based on their distance from the equator.

Like Parmeneides, thinking that the area near the equator was too hot for habitation, Aristotle dubbed the region around the equator (from 23.5° N to 23.5° S) the "Torrid Zone." Both philosophers reasoned the region from the Arctic Circle to the pole to be permanently frozen. This region, thought uninhabitable, was called the "Frigid Zone." The only area believed to be habitable was the northern "Temperate Zone" (the southern one not having been discovered), lying between the "Frigid Zones" and the "Torrid Zone". However, humans have inhabited almost all climates on Earth, including inside the Arctic Circle.

As knowledge of the Earth's geography improved, a second "Temperate Zone" was discovered south of the equator, and a second "Frigid Zone" was discovered around the [[Antarctic]]. Although Aristotle's map was oversimplified, the general idea was correct. Today, the most commonly used climate map is the [[Köppen climate classification]], developed by Russian climatologist of German descent and amateur botanist [[Wladimir Köppen]] (1846–1940), which divides the world into five major climate regions, based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature.

The '''gravity of Earth''', denoted by '''{{mvar|g}}''', is the [[net force|net]] [[acceleration]] that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of [[gravitation]] (from distribution of mass within [[Earth]]) and the [[centrifugal force]] (from the [[Earth's rotation]]).&lt;ref name="Boynton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[International System of Units|SI units]] this acceleration is measured in [[metre per second squared|metres per second squared]] (in symbols, [[metre|m]]/[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) or equivalently in [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] per [[kilogram]] (N/kg or N·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Near Earth's surface, [[gravitational acceleration]] is approximately 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which means that, ignoring the effects of [[drag (physics)|air resistance]], the [[speed]] of an object [[free fall|falling freely]] will increase by about 9.8 metres per second every second. This quantity is sometimes referred to informally as ''little {{mvar|g}}'' (in contrast, the [[gravitational constant]] {{mvar|G}} is referred to as ''big {{mvar|G}}'').

The precise strength of Earth's gravity varies depending on location. The nominal "average" value at Earth's surface, known as {{nowrap|[[standard gravity]]}} is, by definition, 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |editor1-first=Barry N.|editor1-last=Taylor|editor2-first=Ambler|editor2-last=Thompson |author-link= |date=March 2008 |title=The international system of units (SI) |url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication330e2008.pdf|format=pdf |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |page=52 |docket=NIST special publication 330, 2008 edition |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This quantity is denoted variously as {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} (though this sometimes means the normal equatorial value on Earth, 9.78033&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, gee, or simply {{mvar|g}} (which is also used for the variable local value). 

The [[weight]] of an object on Earth's surface is the downwards force on that object, given by [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law of motion]], or {{nowrap|{{math|''F'' {{=}} ''ma''}}}} ({{nowrap|''force'' {{=}} ''mass'' × ''acceleration''}}). Gravitational acceleration contributes to the total gravity acceleration, but other factors, such as the rotation of Earth, also contribute, and, therefore, affect the weight of the object.
Gravity does not normally include the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, which are accounted for in terms of [[tide|tidal effects]].
It is a [[vector (physics)]] quantity, whose direction coincides with a [[plumb bob]].

==Variation in magnitude==
A non-rotating perfect [[sphere]] of uniform mass density, or whose density varies solely with distance from the centre ([[spherical symmetry]]), would produce a gravitational field of uniform magnitude at all points on its [[planetary surface|surface]]. The Earth is rotating and is also not spherically symmetric; rather, it is slightly flatter at the poles while bulging at the Equator: an [[oblate spheroid]]. There are consequently slight deviations in the magnitude of gravity across its surface.

Gravity on the Earth's surface varies by around 0.7%, from 9.7639&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the [[Nevado Huascarán]] mountain in Peru to 9.8337&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the surface of the [[Arctic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirt|first1=Christian|last2=Claessens|first2=Sten|last3=Fecher|first3=Thomas|last4=Kuhn|first4=Michael|last5=Pail|first5=Roland|last6=Rexer|first6=Moritz|title=New ultrahigh-resolution picture of Earth's gravity field|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=August 28, 2013|volume=40|issue=16|pages=4279–4283|doi=10.1002/grl.50838|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.50838/abstract|bibcode=2013GeoRL..40.4279H}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Comparative gravities in various cities around the world|In large cities, it ranges]] from 9.7760&lt;ref name="Wolfram Alpha"&gt;[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gravity+in+kuala+lampur "Wolfram|Alpha Gravity in Kuala Lumpur", Wolfram Alpha, accessed May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Mexico City]], and [[Singapore]] to 9.825 in [[Oslo]] and [[Helsinki]].

===Conventional value===
In 1901 the third [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] defined a standard gravitational acceleration for the surface of the Earth: ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It was based on measurements done at the [[Pavillon de Breteuil]] near Paris in 1888, with a theoretical correction applied in order to convert to a latitude of 45° at sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Artefacts to Atoms: The BIPM and the Search for Ultimate Measurement Standards |author=Terry Quinn |page=127 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-530786-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is thus not a value of any particular place or carefully worked out average, but an agreement for a value to use if a better actual local value is not known or not important.&lt;ref&gt;Resolution of the 3rd CGPM (1901), page 70 (in cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). [http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/3/2/ BIPM – Resolution of the 3rd CGPM]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to define the units [[kilogram force]] and [[pound force]].

===Latitude===
[[Image:Southern ocean gravity hg.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The differences of Earth's gravity around the Antarctic continent.]]
The surface of the Earth is rotating, so it is [[Non-inertial reference frame|not an inertial frame of reference]]. At latitudes nearer the Equator, the outward [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]] produced by Earth's rotation is larger than at polar latitudes. This counteracts the Earth's gravity to a small degree – up to a maximum of 0.3% at the Equator – and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of falling objects.

The second major reason for the difference in gravity at different latitudes is that the Earth's [[equatorial bulge]] (itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation) causes objects at the Equator to be farther from the planet's centre than objects at the poles. Because the force due to gravitational attraction between two bodies (the Earth and the object being weighed) varies inversely with the square of the distance between them, an object at the Equator experiences a weaker gravitational pull than an object at the poles.

In combination, the equatorial bulge and the effects of the surface centrifugal force due to rotation mean that sea-level gravity increases from about 9.780&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the Equator to about 9.832&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the poles, so an object will weigh about 0.5% more at the poles than at the Equator.&lt;ref name="Boynton"&gt;{{cite conference

===Altitude===
[[Image:Erdgvarp.png|thumb|The graph shows the variation in gravity relative to the height of an object above the surface]]
Gravity decreases with altitude as one rises above the Earth's surface because greater altitude means greater distance from the Earth's centre. All other things being equal, an increase in altitude from sea level to {{convert|30000|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip}} causes a weight decrease of about 0.29%. (An additional factor affecting apparent weight is the decrease in air density at altitude, which lessens an object's buoyancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/i-feel-'lighter'-when-up-a-mountain-but-am-i-(faq-mass-and-density) "I feel 'lighter' when up a mountain but am I?"], National Physical Laboratory FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; This would increase a person's apparent weight at an altitude of 9,000 metres by about 0.08%)

It is a common misconception that astronauts in orbit are weightless because they have flown high enough to escape the Earth's gravity. In fact, at an altitude of {{convert|400|km|mi}}, equivalent to a typical orbit of the [[International Space Station|ISS]], gravity is still nearly 90% as strong as at the Earth's surface. Weightlessness actually occurs because orbiting objects are in [[free-fall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/24jan_micro-g/ "The G's in the Machine"], NASA, see "Editor's note #2"&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of ground elevation depends on the density of the ground (see [[#Slab correction|Slab correction]] section). A person flying at 30 000&amp;nbsp;ft above sea level over mountains will feel more gravity than someone at the same elevation but over the sea. However, a person standing on the earth's surface feels less gravity when the elevation is higher.

The following formula approximates the Earth's gravity variation with altitude:
:&lt;math&gt;g_h=g_0\left(\frac{r_\mathrm{e}}{r_\mathrm{e}+h}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where
*{{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the gravitational acceleration at height {{mvar|h}} above sea level.
*{{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Earth radius|Earth's mean radius]].
*{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[standard gravitational acceleration]].

The formula treats the Earth as a perfect sphere with a radially symmetric distribution of mass; a more accurate mathematical treatment is discussed below.

===Depth===
{{See also|Shell theorem}}
An approximate value for gravity at a distance {{mvar|r}} from the center of the Earth can be obtained by assuming that the Earth's density is spherically symmetric. The gravity depends only on the mass inside the sphere of radius {{mvar|r}}. All the contributions from outside cancel out as a consequence of the [[inverse-square law]] of gravitation. Another consequence is that the gravity is the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center. Thus, the gravitational acceleration at this radius is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tipler|first=Paul A.|title=Physics for scientists and engineers.|date=1999|publisher=W.H. Freeman/Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781572594913|pages=336&amp;ndash;337|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(r) = -\frac{GM(r)}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|G}} is the [[gravitational constant]] and {{math|''M''(''r'')}} is the total mass enclosed within radius {{mvar|r}}. If the Earth had a constant density {{mvar|ρ}}, the mass would be {{math|''M''(''r'') {{=}} (4/3)π''ρr''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the dependence of gravity on depth would be
:&lt;math&gt;g(r) = \frac{4\pi}{3} G \rho r.&lt;/math&gt;
{{mvar|g}} at depth {{mvar|d}} is given by
{{math|''g'''{{=}}''g''(1-''d''/''R'')}} where {{mvar|g}} is acceleration due to gravity on surface of the earth, {{mvar|d}} is depth and {{mvar|R}} is radius of [[Earth]].
If the density decreased linearly with increasing radius from a density {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} at the center to {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} at the surface, then {{math|''ρ''(''r'') {{=}} ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − (''&amp;rho;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ''r'' / ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the dependence would be
:&lt;math&gt;g(r) = \frac{4\pi}{3} G \rho_0 r - \frac{4\pi}{3} G \left(\rho_0-\rho_1\right) \frac{r^2}{r_{\mathrm{e}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The actual depth dependence of density and gravity, inferred from seismic travel times (see [[Adams–Williamson equation]]), is shown in the graphs below.

===Local topography and geology===
{{See also|Physical geodesy}}
Local differences in [[topography]] (such as the presence of mountains), [[geology]] (such as the density of rocks in the vicinity), and deeper [[Plate tectonics|tectonic structure]] cause local and regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as [[Gravity anomaly|gravitational anomalies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. B. |last1=Watts |first2=S. F. |last2=Daly |title=Long wavelength gravity and topography anomalies |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=9 |pages=415–418 |date=May 1981 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.09.050181.002215 |bibcode=1981AREPS...9..415W |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1981AREPS...9..415W&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;filetype=.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these anomalies can be very extensive, resulting in bulges in [[sea level]], and throwing [[pendulum]] clocks out of synchronisation.

The study of these anomalies forms the basis of gravitational [[geophysics]]. The fluctuations are measured with highly sensitive [[gravimeter]]s, the effect of topography and other known factors is subtracted, and from the resulting data conclusions are drawn. Such techniques are now used by [[prospectors]] to find [[oil]] and [[mineral deposits]]. Denser rocks (often containing mineral [[ore]]s) cause higher than normal local gravitational fields on the Earth's surface. Less dense [[sedimentary rock]]s cause the opposite.

===Other factors===
In air, objects experience a supporting [[buoyancy]] force which reduces the apparent strength of gravity (as measured by an object's weight). The magnitude of the effect depends on air density (and hence air pressure); see [[Apparent weight]] for details.

The gravitational effects of the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]] (also the cause of the [[tide]]s) have a very small effect on the apparent strength of Earth's gravity, depending on their relative positions; typical variations are 2&amp;nbsp;µm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.2 [[Gal (unit)|mGal]]) over the course of a day.

==Variation in direction==
Gravity acceleration is a [[vector quantity]]. In a spherically symmetric Earth, gravity would point directly towards the sphere's centre. As the Earth is slightly flatter, there are consequently slight deviations in the direction of gravity.

==Comparative values in worldwide==
Tools exist for calculating the strength of gravity at various cities around the world.&lt;ref name=wolfram&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/widgets/view.jsp?id=d34e8683df527e3555153d979bcda9cf Gravitational Fields Widget as of Oct 25th, 2012]  – [[WolframAlpha]]&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of latitude can be clearly seen with gravity in high-latitude cities: Anchorage (9.826&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Helsinki (9.825&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), being about 0.5% greater than that in cities near the equator: Kuala Lumpur (9.776&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Manila (9.780&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;!-- (| V1 - V2 | / ((V1 + V2)/2)) * 100 = 0.52038% --&gt;  The effect of altitude can be seen in Mexico City (9.776&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; altitude {{convert|2240|m|ft|}}), and by comparing Denver (9.798&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; {{convert|1616|m|ft}}) with Washington, D.C. (9.801&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; {{convert|30|m|ft}}), both of which are near 39°&amp;nbsp;N. Measured values can be obtained from Physical and Mathematical Tables by T.M. Yarwood and F. Castle, Macmillan, revised edition 1970.&lt;ref&gt;T.M. Yarwood and F.

This is the [[International Gravity Formula]] 1967, the 1967 Geodetic Reference System Formula, Helmert's equation or Clairaut's formula.&lt;ref name="IGF"&gt;[http://geophysics.ou.edu/solid_earth/notes/potential/igf.htm International Gravity formula] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820093812/http://geophysics.ou.edu/solid_earth/notes/potential/igf.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative formula for ''g'' as a function of latitude is the WGS ([[World Geodetic System]]) 84 Ellipsoidal [[gravity formula|Gravity Formula]]:&lt;ref name="DoD-WGS84"&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf '''''Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1984 ― Its Definition and Relationships with Local Geodetic Systems''''',NIMA TR8350.2, 3rd ed., Tbl. 3.4, Eq. 4-1]
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g\{\phi\}= \mathbb{G}_e\left[\frac{1+k\sin^2\phi}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}}\right],\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where,

*&lt;math&gt;a,\,b&lt;/math&gt; are the equatorial and polar semi-axes, respectively;
*&lt;math&gt;e^2 = 1 - (b/a)^2&lt;/math&gt; is the spheroid's [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], squared;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e,\,\mathbb{G}_p\,&lt;/math&gt; is the defined gravity at the equator and poles, respectively;
*&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{b\,\mathbb{G}_p - a\,\mathbb{G}_e}{a\,\mathbb{G}_e}&lt;/math&gt; (formula constant);

then, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_p = 9.8321849378 \,\,\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="DoD-WGS84"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g\{\phi\}= 9.7803253359\,\,\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2} \left[\frac{1 + 0.00193185265241\,\sin^2\phi}{\sqrt{1 - 0.00669437999013\,\sin^2\phi}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

The difference between the WGS-84 formula and Helmert's equation is less than 0.68&amp;nbsp;&amp;mu;m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Free air correction===
{{main article|Free-air anomaly}}

The first correction to be applied to the model is the free air correction (FAC) that accounts for heights above sea level. Near the surface of the Earth (sea level), gravity decreases with height such that linear extrapolation would give zero gravity at a height of one half of the earth's radius - (9.8&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; per 3,200&amp;nbsp;km.)&lt;ref&gt;The rate of decrease is calculated by differentiating ''g''(''r'') with respect to ''r'' and evaluating at ''r''=''r''&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the mass and radius of the [[Earth]]:
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{Earth}= 6.371 \cdot 10^{6}\,\mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{Earth}= 5.9722 \cdot 10^{24}\,\mathrm{kg} &lt;/math&gt;

The FAC correction factor (Δ''g'') can be derived from the definition of the acceleration due to gravity in terms of G, the [[Gravitational Constant]] (see Estimating ''g'' from the law of universal gravitation, below):
:&lt;math&gt;g_0 = G \, m_\mathrm{Earth} / r_\mathrm{Earth}^2 = 9.8196\,\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;G = 6.67384 \cdot 10^{-11}\,\frac{\mathrm{m}^3}{\mathrm{kg}\cdot\mathrm{s}^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

At a height ''h'' above the nominal surface of the earth ''g&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;g_h = G \, m_\mathrm{Earth} / \left(r_\mathrm{Earth} + h \right) ^2&lt;/math&gt;

So the FAC for a height ''h'' above the nominal earth radius can be expressed:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_h = \left [ G \, m_\mathrm{Earth} / \left(r_\mathrm{Earth} + h \right) ^2 \right ] - \left[G \, m_\mathrm{Earth} / r_\mathrm{Earth}^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

This expression can be readily used for programming or inclusion in a spreadsheet. Collecting terms, simplifying and neglecting small terms (''h''&lt;&lt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;), however yields the good approximation:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_h \approx - \, \dfrac{ G \, m_\mathrm{Earth}}{ r_\mathrm{Earth} ^2} \cdot \dfrac{ 2 \,h}{r_\mathrm{Earth}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the numerical values above and for a height ''h'' in metres:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_h \approx - 3.086 \cdot 10^{-6}\, h&lt;/math&gt;

Grouping the latitude and FAC altitude factors the expression most commonly found in the literature is:
:&lt;math&gt;g\{\phi,h\}=g\{\phi\}-3.086 \cdot 10^{-6}h&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g\{\phi,h\}&lt;/math&gt; = acceleration in m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; at latitude &lt;math&gt;\ \phi&lt;/math&gt; and altitude ''h'' in metres.

===Slab correction===
{{main article|Bouguer anomaly}}

::&lt;small&gt;Note: The section uses the [[Galileo (unit)|galileo]] (symbol: "Gal"), which is a cgs unit for acceleration of 1&amp;nbsp;centimetre/second&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;

For flat terrain above sea level a second term is added for the gravity due to the extra mass; for this purpose the extra mass can be approximated by an infinite horizontal slab, and we get 2π''G'' times the mass per unit area, i.e. 4.2{{e|−10}}&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (0.042&amp;nbsp;μGal·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (the Bouguer correction). For a mean rock density of 2.67 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; this gives 1.1{{e|−6}}&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.11&amp;nbsp;mGal·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Combined with the free-air correction this means a reduction of gravity at the surface of ca. 2&amp;nbsp;µm·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.20&amp;nbsp;mGal) for every metre of elevation of the terrain. (The two effects would cancel at a surface rock density of 4/3 times the average density of the whole earth. The density of the whole earth is 5.515 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, so standing on a slab of something like iron whose density is over 7.35 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; would increase one's weight.)

For the gravity below the surface we have to apply the free-air correction as well as a double Bouguer correction. With the infinite slab model this is because moving the point of observation below the slab changes the gravity due to it to its opposite. Alternatively, we can consider a [[Shell theorem|spherically symmetrical Earth]] and subtract from the mass of the Earth that of the shell outside the point of observation, because that does not cause gravity inside. This gives the same result.

==Estimating ''g'' from the law of universal gravitation==
From the [[law of universal gravitation]], the force on a body acted upon by Earth's gravity is given by
:&lt;math&gt;F = G\, \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = \left(G\,\frac{m_1}{r^2}\right) m_2&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the distance between the centre of the Earth and the body (see below), and here we take ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the mass of the Earth and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be the mass of the body.

Additionally, [[Newton's second law]], ''F'' = ''ma'', where ''m'' is mass and ''a'' is acceleration, here tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;F = m_2\,g\,&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the two formulas it is seen that:
:&lt;math&gt;g = G\, \frac {m_1}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So, to find the acceleration due to gravity at sea level, substitute the values of the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'', the Earth's [[mass]] (in kilograms), ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Earth's [[radius]] (in metres), ''r'', to obtain the value of ''g'':
:&lt;math&gt;g = G\, \frac {m_1}{r^2} = 6.67384 \cdot 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{m}^3\cdot\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2} \,\,\,\frac{5.9722 \cdot 10^{24} \,\mathrm{kg}}{(6.371 \cdot 10^6\,\mathrm{m})^2} = 9.8196 \,\,\mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this formula only works because of the mathematical fact that the gravity of a uniform spherical body, as measured on or above its surface, is the same as if all its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre. This is what allows us to use the Earth's radius for ''r''.

The value obtained agrees approximately with the measured value of ''g''. The difference may be attributed to several factors, mentioned above under "Variations":
*The Earth is not [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]]
*The Earth is not a perfect sphere, and an average value must be used for its radius
*This calculated value of ''g'' only includes true gravity. It does not include the reduction of constraint force that we perceive as a reduction of gravity due to the rotation of Earth, and some of gravity being counteracted by centrifugal force.
There are significant uncertainties in the values of ''r'' and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as used in this calculation, and the value of ''[[Gravitational constant|G]]'' is also rather difficult to measure precisely.

If ''G'', ''g'' and ''r'' are known then a reverse calculation will give an estimate of the mass of the Earth. This method was used by [[Henry Cavendish]].

'''Legal naturalism''' is a term coined by [[Olufemi Taiwo]] to describe a current in the social philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] which can be interpreted as one of [[Natural Law]]. Taiwo considered it the manifestation of Natural Law in a [[dialectical materialism|dialectical materialist]] context.

This magmatic water is released to the atmosphere during a [[volcanic]] eruption. Magmatic water may also be released as [[hydrothermal]] fluids during the late stages of magmatic crystallization or solidification within the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The crystallization of [[hydroxyl]] bearing [[amphibole]] and [[mica]] minerals acts to contain part of the magmatic water within a solidified [[igneous rock]]. Ultimate sources of this magmatic water includes water and hydrous minerals in rocks melted during [[subduction]] as well as [[Water_distribution_on_Earth#Water_in_Earth.27s_mantle|primordial water]] brought up from the deep [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].

==Water in silicate melts==
Water has limited [[solubility]] in silicate melts ranging from almost 0% at surface pressure to 10% at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C and 5 kbar of pressure for a [[granitic]] melt.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Anthony, ''Igneous Petrology'', Longman, 1987, pp. 253-260 {{ISBN|0-582-30174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solubility is lower for more [[mafic]] magmas. As the temperature and pressure drop during emplacement and cooling of the magma a separate [[aqueous]] phase will [[Solid_solution#Exsolution|exsolve]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guilbert&gt;John M. Guilbert and Charles F Park, Jr., ''THe Geology of Ore Deposits'', Freeman, 1986, pp. 32-45 {{ISBN|0-7167-1456-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aqueous phase will be enriched in other volatile and silicate incompatible species such as the metals: [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[silver]] and [[gold]]; [[alkali]]s and [[alkaline earth]]s and others, including: [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], [[boron]], [[rubidium]]; and volatiles: [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]] and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt;

Water in silicate melts at the high temperature and pressure conditions within the crust exists as a [[supercritical fluid]] rather than in a gaseous state (the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] for water is at 374&amp;nbsp;°C and 218 bar).&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;

==Stable isotope data==
[[Stable isotope]] studies of oxygen and hydrogen in igneous rocks indicate that the [[oxygen-18]], δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, content is approximately 6 - 8 ‰ higher than standard mean ocean water ([[SMOW]]) while the [[deuterium]], δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, content is 40 to 80 ‰ lower than SMOW. Water in equilibrium with [[igneous]] melts should bear the same isotopic signature for oxygen-18 and deuterium. Isotope data on hydrothermal solutions spatially associated with [[igneous intrusion]]s should reflect this isotopic signature. However, isotopic studies of hydrothermal waters indicate that most bear the isotopic signature of [[meteoric water]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; Any magmatic waters in these [[hydrothermal]] solutions must have been swamped by the circulating meteoric groundwaters of the environment.

[[Fluid inclusions]] are microscopic bubbles of aqueous solutions which were trapped within crystals during crystallization and are considered as relic samples of the mineralizing waters. Analyses of the isotopic content of these trapped bubbles show a wide range of δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H content.&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt; All examined show an enrichment in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and depletion in &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H relative to SMOW and meteoric waters. Fluid inclusion data from a number of ore deposits plot directly on the magmatic water ''region'' of an δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O vs δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H plot.&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">In [[chemistry]], '''metal vapor synthesis''' (MVS) is a method for preparing [[metal complex]]es by combining freshly produced metal atoms or small particles with [[ligand]]s.  In contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands.  The method has been used to prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by traditional synthetic methods, e.g. Ti(η&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-toluene)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verdampfer-test.de/aspire-cleito/|title=Aspire Cleito Verdampfer Test|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2017-08-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal evaporates upon being [[resistive heating|heated resistively]] or irradiated with an [[electron beam]].  The apparatus operates under high vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schmidt, K. J. Klabunde, A. Ponce, A. Smetana, D. Heroux "Metal Vapor Synthesis of Transition Metal Compounds" Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry 2006, John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{DOI|10.1002/0470862106.ia137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a common implementation, the metal vapor and the organic ligand are co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Educ., 1972, volume 49, p 782. {{DOI| 10.1021/ed049p782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several case where compounds are prepared by MVS, related preparations employ conventional routes.  Thus, tris(butadiene)molybdenum was first prepared by co-condensation of butadiene and Mo vapor, but yields are higher for the reduction of [[molybdenum(V) chloride]] in the presence of the diene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stephan, G.

A '''mineral''' is a naturally occurring [[chemical compound]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hans-Rudolf |last1=Wenk |first2=Andrei |last2=Bulakh |title=Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn= 9780521529587|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually of [[crystal]]line form and [[abiogenic|not produced by life processes]]. A  mineral has one specific [[chemical composition]], whereas a [[rock (geology)|rock]] can be an [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] of different minerals or [[mineraloid]]s. The study of minerals is called [[mineralogy]].

Minerals are classified by variety, species, series and group, in order of increasing generality. As of November 2018, there are [[List of minerals (complete)|more than 5,500]] known mineral ''species'';&lt;ref name="rruff1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rruff.info/ima/ |title=IMA Database of Mineral Properties/ RRUFF Project |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=Department of Geosciences, University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5,389 of these have been approved by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA).&lt;ref name="IMAMineralsCount"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrmima.nrm.se//imalist.htm | title=The New IMA List of Minerals  – A Work in Progress | publisher=[[International Mineralogical Association|IMA]] – CNMNC (Commission on New Minerals Nomenclature and Classification) | work=The New IMA List of Minerals | date=September 2018 | accessdate=2 November 2018 | author=Pasero, Marco et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Minerals are distinguished by various [[Chemical property|chemical]] and [[physical property|physical properties]]. Differences in [[chemical composition]] and [[crystal structure]] distinguish the various species, which were determined by the mineral's geological environment when formed. Changes in the temperature, pressure, or bulk composition of a rock mass cause changes in its minerals. Within a mineral species there may be variation in physical properties or minor amounts of impurities that are recognized by mineralogists or wider society as a mineral ''variety'',&lt;ref name="MinVar1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mindat.org/glossary/mineral_variety | title=Definition of mineral variety | publisher=mindat.org | accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[amethyst]], a purple variety of the mineral species [[quartz]].

Minerals can be described by their various physical properties, which are related to their chemical structure and composition. Common distinguishing characteristics include crystal structure and [[Crystal habit|habit]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]], [[diaphaneity]], colour, [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]], [[Tenacity (mineralogy)|tenacity]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[Fracture (mineralogy)|fracture]], parting, [[specific gravity]], [[magnetism]], taste or smell, [[radioactivity]], and [[acid|reaction to acid]].

Minerals are classified by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. [[Silicon]] and [[oxygen]] constitute approximately 75% of the Earth's crust, which translates directly into the predominance of [[silicate minerals]]. The silicate minerals compose over 90% of the [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/mineral-chemical-compound/Silicates&lt;/ref&gt; The silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses by the degree of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymerization]] in the chemical structure. All silicate minerals have a base unit of a [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; silica tetrahedron—that is, a silicon cation coordinated by four oxygen [[anion]]s, which gives the shape of a [[tetrahedron]]. These tetrahedra can be polymerized to give the subclasses: orthosilicates (no polymerization, thus single tetrahedra), disilicates (two tetrahedra bonded together), cyclosilicates (rings of tetrahedra), inosilicates (chains of tetrahedra), phyllosilicates (sheets of tetrahedra), and tectosilicates (three-dimensional network of tetrahedra). Other important mineral groups include the [[Native element minerals|native elements]], [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]], [[Oxide minerals|oxides]], [[Halide minerals|halides]], [[Carbonate minerals|carbonates]], [[Sulfate minerals|sulfates]], and [[Phosphate minerals|phosphates]].

==Definition==

===Basic definition===
One definition of a mineral encompasses the following criteria:&lt;ref name="DG2_4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mineralogy and Optical Mineralogy|last = Dyar, Gunter, and Tasa|first = |publisher = Mineralogical Society of America|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0939950812|location = |pages = 2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Formed by a natural process ([[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] compounds are excluded).
#[[thermodynamic stability|Stable or metastable]] at [[room  temperature]] (25&amp;nbsp;°C). In the simplest sense, this means the mineral must be solid. Classical examples of exceptions to this rule include native [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which crystallizes at −39&amp;nbsp;°C, and water ice, which is solid only below 0&amp;nbsp;°C; because these two minerals were described before 1959, they were grandfathered by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2647.html |title=Mercury |publisher=Mindat.org |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2001.html |title=Ice |publisher=Mindat.org |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern advances have included extensive study of [[liquid crystals]], which also extensively involve mineralogy.
#Represented by a [[chemical formula]]. Minerals are chemical compounds, and as such they can be described by fixed or a variable formula. Many mineral groups and species are composed of a solid solution; pure substances are not usually found because of contamination or chemical substitution. For example, the [[olivine]] group is described by the variable formula (Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a solid solution of two end-member species, magnesium-rich [[forsterite]] and iron-rich [[fayalite]], which are described by a fixed chemical formula. Mineral species themselves could have a variable composition, such as the sulfide [[mackinawite]], (Fe, Ni)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, which is mostly a ferrous sulfide, but has a very significant nickel impurity that is reflected in its formula.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2512.html|title=Mackinawite|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Ordered atomic arrangement. This generally means [[crystallinity|crystalline]]; however, crystals are also periodic, so the broader criterion is used instead.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt; An ordered atomic arrangement gives rise to a variety of [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] physical properties, such as crystal form, hardness, and cleavage.&lt;ref name="CL13-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several recent proposals to classify biogenic or [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] substances as minerals. The formal definition of a mineral approved by the IMA in 1995: "A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes."&lt;ref name=Nickel&gt;{{cite journal |last = Nickel |first = Ernest H. |title = The definition of a mineral |journal = The Canadian Mineralogist |volume = 33 |issue = 3 |pages = 689–90 |date = 1995 |url = https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/canmin/article-abstract/33/3/689/12679/the-definition-of-a-mineral?redirectedFrom=fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Usually [[abiogenic]] (not resulting from the activity of living organisms). Biogenic substances are explicitly excluded by the IMA: "Biogenic substances are chemical compounds produced entirely by biological processes without a geological component (e.g., urinary calculi, oxalate crystals in plant tissues, shells of marine molluscs, etc.) and are not regarded as minerals. However, if geological processes were involved in the genesis of the compound, then the product can be accepted as a mineral."&lt;ref name=Nickel /&gt;

The first three general characteristics are less debated than the last two.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt;

===Recent advances===
Mineral classification schemes and their definitions are evolving to match recent advances in mineral science. Recent changes have included the addition of an organic class, in both the new Dana and the [[Strunz classification]] schemes.&lt;ref name=Dana&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Classification 8th edition – Organic Compounds|url=http://www.mindat.org/dana.php?a=50|website=mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strunz&gt;{{cite web|title=Nickel-Strunz Classification - silicates (Germanates) 10th edition|url=https://www.mindat.org/strunz.php?a=9|website=mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic class includes a very rare group of minerals with [[hydrocarbons]]. The IMA Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names adopted in 2009 a hierarchical scheme for the naming and classification of mineral groups and group names and established seven commissions and four working groups to review and classify minerals into an official listing of their published names.&lt;ref name="Mills09" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ima-mineralogy.org/sciactivities.html IMA divisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810045840/http://www.ima-mineralogy.org/sciactivities.html |date=2011-08-10 }}. Ima-mineralogy.org (2011-01-12). Retrieved on 2011-10-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to these new rules, "mineral species can be grouped in a number of different ways, on the basis of chemistry, crystal structure, occurrence, association, genetic history, or resource, for example, depending on the purpose to be served by the classification."&lt;ref name="Mills09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mills | first1=J. S. | last2=Hatert | first2=F. | last3=Nickel | first3=E. H. | last4=Ferraris | first4=G. | title=The standardisation of mineral group hierarchies: application to recent nomenclature proposals | journal=European Journal of Mineralogy | volume=21 | pages=1073–80 | doi=10.1127/0935-1221/2009/0021-1994 | date=2009 | issue=5 | bibcode=2009EJMin..21.1073M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nickel (1995){{huh|date=September 2017}} exclusion of biogenic substances was not universally adhered to. For example, Lowenstam (1981) stated that "organisms are capable of forming a diverse array of minerals, some of which cannot be formed inorganically in the biosphere."&lt;ref name="Lowenstam81"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Lowenstam | last1=H. A. | title=Minerals formed by organisms | journal=Science | date=1981 | volume=211 | issue=4487 | pages=1126–31 | doi=10.1126/science.7008198 | jstor=1685216 | pmid=7008198|bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1126L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is a matter of classification and less to do with the constituents of the minerals themselves. Skinner (2005) views all solids as potential minerals and includes [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] in the mineral kingdom, which are those that are created by the metabolic activities of organisms. Skinner expanded the previous definition of a mineral to classify "element or compound, amorphous or crystalline, formed through ''[[Biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] '' processes," as a mineral.&lt;ref name="Skinner05" /&gt;

Recent advances in high-resolution [[genetics]] and [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]] are providing revelations on the biogeochemical relations between [[microorganism]]s and minerals that may make Nickel's (1995) biogenic mineral exclusion obsolete and Skinner's (2005) biogenic mineral inclusion a necessity.&lt;ref name=Nickel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinner05"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Skinner | first1=H. C. W. | title=Biominerals | journal=Mineralogical Magazine | volume=69 | issue=5 | pages=621–41| doi=10.1180/0026461056950275 | date=2005 | bibcode=2005MinM...69..621S }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the IMA-commissioned "Working Group on Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry " deals with minerals in the [[hydrosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Group on Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry|url=https://www.ima-mineralogy.org/WGEMG_objectives.htm|website=Commissions, working groups and committees|publisher=International Mineralogical Association|accessdate=4 April 2018|language=en|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's scope includes [[Biomineralization|mineral-forming microorganisms]], which exist on nearly every rock, soil, and particle surface spanning the globe to depths of at least 1600 metres below the [[Seabed|sea floor]] and 70 kilometres into the [[stratosphere]] (possibly entering the [[mesosphere]]).&lt;ref name="Takai10"&gt;{{cite book | last=Takai | first=K. | chapter=Limits of life and the biosphere: Lessons from the detection of microorganisms in the deep sea and deep subsurface of the Earth. | title=Origins and Evolution of Life: An Astrobiological Perspective | editor1-last=Gargaud | editor1-first=M. | editor2-last=Lopez-Garcia | editor2-first=P. | editor3-last=Martin | editor3-first=H. | pages=469–86 | date=2010 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, UK |isbn= 9781139494595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roussel08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Roussel | first1=E.

===Rocks, ores, and gems===
[[File:Sillimanite-199671.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Schist]] is a [[metamorphic rock]] characterized by an abundance of platy minerals. In this example, the rock has prominent [[sillimanite]] [[porphyroblast]]s as large as {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.]]
Minerals are not equivalent to rocks. A [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is an aggregate of one or more minerals&lt;ref name="ChL15-16"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;  or mineraloids. Some rocks, such as [[limestone]] or [[quartzite]], are composed primarily of one mineral—[[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] in the case of limestone, and [[quartz]] in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 719–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 747–48&lt;/ref&gt; Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a [[granite]] is defined by proportions of quartz, [[alkali feldspar]], and [[plagioclase feldspar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 694–96&lt;/ref&gt; The other minerals in the rock are termed accessory, and do not greatly affect the bulk composition of the rock. Rocks can also be composed entirely of non-mineral material; [[coal]] is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of organically derived carbon.&lt;ref name="ChL15-16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 728–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In rocks, some mineral species and groups are much more abundant than others; these are termed the rock-forming minerals. The major examples of these are quartz, the [[feldspar]]s, the [[mica]]s, the [[amphibole]]s, the [[pyroxene]]s, the [[olivine]]s, and calcite; except for the last one, all of these minerals are silicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, around 150 minerals are considered particularly important, whether in terms of their abundance or aesthetic value in terms of collecting.&lt;ref name="ChL14"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially valuable minerals and rocks are referred to as [[industrial minerals]]. For example, [[muscovite]], a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman and Cole, pp. 531–32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ore]]s are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are [[cinnabar]] (HgS), an ore of mercury, [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or [[cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), an ore of tin. [[gemstone|Gem]]s are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] are both [[corundum]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ChL14-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomenclature and classification===
Minerals are classified by variety, species, series and group, in order of increasing generality. The basic level of definition is that of mineral species, each of which is distinguished from the others by unique chemical and physical properties. For example, quartz is defined by its [[Chemical formula|formula]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a specific [[Crystal structure|crystalline structure]] that distinguishes it from other minerals with the same chemical formula (termed [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]). When there exists a range of composition between two minerals species, a mineral series is defined. For example, the [[biotite]] series is represented by variable amounts of the [[endmembers]] [[phlogopite]], [[siderophyllite]], [[annite]], and [[eastonite]]. In contrast, a mineral group is a grouping of mineral species with some common chemical properties that share a crystal structure. The [[pyroxene]] group has a common  formula of XY(Si,Al)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, where X and Y are both cations, with X typically [[ionic radius|bigger]] than Y; the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates that crystallize in either the [[orthorhombic]] or [[monoclinic]] crystal systems. Finally, a mineral variety is a specific type of mineral species that differs by some physical characteristic, such as colour or crystal habit. An example is [[amethyst]], which is a purple variety of quartz.&lt;ref name="DG20-22"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common classifications, Dana and Strunz, are used for minerals; both rely on composition, specifically with regards to important chemical groups, and structure. [[James Dwight Dana]], a leading geologist of his time, first published his ''System of Mineralogy'' in 1837; as of 1997, it is in its eighth edition. The Dana classification assigns a four-part number to a mineral species. Its class number is based on important compositional groups; the type gives the ratio of cations to anions in the mineral, and the last two numbers group minerals by structural similarity within a given type or class. The less commonly used [[Strunz classification]], named for German mineralogist [[Karl Hugo Strunz]], is based on the Dana system, but combines both chemical and structural criteria, the latter with regards to distribution of chemical bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp 558–59&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|11}}, 5,389 mineral species are approved by the IMA.&lt;ref name="IMAMineralsCount"/&gt; They are most commonly named after a person (45%), followed by discovery location (23%); names based on chemical composition (14%) and physical properties (8%) are the two other major groups of mineral name etymologies.&lt;ref name="DG20-22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "species" (from the Latin ''species'', "a particular sort, kind, or type with distinct look, or appearance")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/species|website=etymonline|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the classification scheme in ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. He divided the natural world into three kingdoms &amp;ndash; plants, animals, and minerals &amp;ndash; and classified each with the same hierarchy.&lt;ref name="wilk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilk|first1=H|editor1-last=Wilk|editor1-first=H|title=The Magic of Minerals|date=1986|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-642-64783-3|page=154|format=Hardcover|chapter=Systematic Classification of Minerals|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-61304-3|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-61304-3_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In descending order, these were Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Tribe, Genus, and Species.

==Chemistry==
[[File:Hubnerite-Quartz-216455.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Hübnerite]], the manganese-rich end-member of the [[wolframite]] series, with minor quartz in the background]]
The abundance and diversity of minerals is controlled directly by their chemistry, in turn dependent on elemental abundances in the Earth. The majority of minerals observed are derived from the Earth's crust. Eight elements account for most of the key components of minerals, due to their abundance in the crust. These eight elements, summing to over 98% of the crust by weight, are, in order of decreasing abundance: [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]. Oxygen and silicon are by far the two most important – oxygen composes 47% of the crust by weight, and silicon accounts for 28%.&lt;ref name="DG4-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The minerals that form are directly controlled by the bulk chemistry of the parent body. For example, a [[magma]] rich in iron and magnesium will form [[mafic]] minerals, such as olivine and the pyroxenes; in contrast, a more silica-rich magma will crystallize to form minerals that incorporate more SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as the feldspars and quartz. In a [[limestone]], [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] (both CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) form because the rock is rich in calcium and carbonate.  A corollary is that a mineral will not be found in a rock whose bulk chemistry does not resemble the bulk chemistry of a given mineral with the exception of trace minerals. For example, [[kyanite]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; forms from the [[metamorphism]] of aluminium-rich [[shale]]s; it would not likely occur in aluminium-poor rock, such as [[quartzite]].

The chemical composition may vary between [[Endmember (mineralogy)|end member]] species of a [[solid solution]] series. For example, the [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]s comprise a continuous series from [[sodium]]-rich end member [[albite]] (NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) to [[calcium]]-rich [[anorthite]] (CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): [[oligoclase]], [[andesine]], [[labradorite]], and [[bytownite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the [[wolframite]] series of [[manganese]]-rich [[hübnerite]] and iron-rich [[ferberite]].

Chemical substitution and coordination polyhedra explain this common feature of minerals. In nature, minerals are not pure substances, and are contaminated by whatever other elements are present in the given chemical system. As a result, it is possible for one element to be substituted for another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical substitution will occur between ions of a similar size and charge; for example, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; will not substitute for Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; because of chemical and structural incompatibilities caused by a big difference in size and charge. A common example of chemical substitution is that of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, which are close in charge, size, and abundance in the crust. In the example of plagioclase, there are three cases of substitution. Feldspars are all framework silicates, which have a silicon-oxygen ratio of 2:1, and the space for other elements is given by the substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to give a base unit of [AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;; without the substitution, the formula would be charge-balanced as SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, giving quartz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of this structural property will be explained further by coordination polyhedra. The second substitution occurs between Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; however, the difference in charge has to accounted for by making a second substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordination polyhedra are geometric representations of how a cation is surrounded by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron – one Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; surrounded by four O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: in the case of the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where the compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination with oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination numbers because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last [[Atomic orbital|orbital subshell]] of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure, such as in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and [[garnet]], will change to a [[perovskite structure]], where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Other examples are the aluminosilicates [[kyanite]], [[andalusite]], and [[sillimanite]] (polymorphs, since they share the formula Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), which differ by the coordination number of the Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature.&lt;ref name="DG4-7"/&gt; In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaolinite-Orthoclase-lw18c.jpg|thumb|When minerals react, the products will sometimes assume the shape of the reagent; the product mineral is termed a pseudomorph of (or after) the reagent. Illustrated here is a pseudomorph of [[kaolinite]] after [[orthoclase]]. Here, the pseudomorph preserved the Carlsbad [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] common in orthoclase.]]

Changes in temperature and pressure and composition alter the mineralogy of a rock sample. Changes in composition can be caused by processes such as [[weathering]] or [[metasomatism]] ([[hydrothermal alteration]]). Changes in temperature and pressure occur when the host rock undergoes [[tectonic]] or [[magmatic]] movement into differing physical regimes. Changes in [[thermodynamic]] conditions make it favourable for mineral assemblages to react with each other to produce new minerals; as such, it is possible for two rocks to have an identical or a very similar bulk rock chemistry without having a similar mineralogy. This process of mineralogical alteration is related to the [[rock cycle]]. An example of a series of mineral reactions is illustrated as follows.&lt;ref name="DG549"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthoclase]] feldspar (KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral commonly found in [[granite]], a [[plutonic]] [[igneous rock]]. When exposed to weathering, it reacts to form [[kaolinite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a sedimentary mineral, and [[silicic acid]]):

:2 KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Under low-grade metamorphic conditions, kaolinite reacts with quartz to form [[pyrophyllite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

As metamorphic grade increases, the pyrophyllite reacts to form kyanite and quartz:

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Alternatively, a mineral may change its crystal structure as a consequence of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting. For example, quartz will change into a variety of its SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], such as [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] at high temperatures, and [[coesite]] at high pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Classifying minerals ranges from simple to difficult. A mineral can be identified by several physical properties, some of them being sufficient for full identification without equivocation. In other cases, minerals can only be classified by more complex [[Optical mineralogy|optical]], chemical or [[X-ray diffraction]] analysis; these methods, however, can be costly and time-consuming.  Physical properties applied for classification include crystal structure and habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, cleavage and fracture, and specific gravity. Other less general tests include [[fluorescence]], [[phosphorescence]], [[magnetism]], [[radioactivity]], tenacity (response to mechanical induced changes of shape or form), [[piezoelectricity]] and reactivity to dilute [[acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Topaz-235220.jpg|right|thumb|[[Topaz]] has a characteristic orthorhombic elongated crystal shape.]]
[[Crystal structure]] results from the orderly geometric spatial arrangement of atoms in the internal structure of a mineral. This crystal structure is based on regular internal atomic or [[ion]]ic arrangement that is often expressed in the geometric form that the crystal takes. Even when the mineral grains are too small to see or are irregularly shaped, the underlying crystal structure is always periodic and can be determined by [[X-ray]] diffraction.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt; Minerals are typically described by their symmetry content. Crystals are [[crystallographic restriction theorem|restricted]] to [[Crystallographic point group|32 point groups]], which differ by their symmetry. These groups are classified in turn into more broad categories, the most encompassing of these being the six crystal families.&lt;ref name="DG69-80"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 69–80&lt;/ref&gt;

These families can be described by the relative lengths of the three crystallographic axes, and the angles between them; these relationships correspond to the symmetry operations that define the narrower point groups. They are summarized below; a, b, and c represent the axes, and α, β, γ represent the angle opposite the respective crystallographic axis (e.g. α is the angle opposite the a-axis, [[wikt:viz.|viz.]] the angle between the b and c axes):&lt;ref name="DG69-80" /&gt;

The hexagonal crystal family is also split into two crystal ''systems'' – the [[trigonal]], which has a three-fold axis of symmetry, and the hexagonal, which has a six-fold axis of symmetry.

Chemistry and crystal structure together define a mineral. With a restriction to 32 point groups, minerals of different chemistry may have identical crystal structure. For example, [[halite]] (NaCl), [[galena]] (PbS), and [[periclase]] (MgO) all belong to the hexaoctahedral point group (isometric family), as they have a similar [[stoichiometry]] between their different constituent elements. In contrast, [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] are groupings of minerals that share a chemical formula but have a different structure. For example, [[pyrite]] and [[marcasite]], both iron sulfides, have the formula FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; however, the former is isometric while the latter is orthorhombic. This polymorphism extends to other sulfides with the generic AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formula; these two groups are collectively known as the pyrite and marcasite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 654–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Polymorphism can extend beyond pure symmetry content. The aluminosilicates are a group of three minerals – [[kyanite]], [[andalusite]], and [[sillimanite]] – which share the chemical formula Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These differences arise corresponding to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination with oxygen. Silicon, as a general rule, is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a case like [[stishovite]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt; In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 631–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in crystal structure and chemistry greatly influence other physical properties of the mineral. The carbon allotropes [[diamond]] and [[graphite]] have vastly different properties; diamond is the hardest natural substance, has an adamantine lustre, and belongs to the isometric crystal family, whereas graphite is very soft, has a greasy lustre, and crystallises in the hexagonal family. This difference is accounted for by differences in bonding. In diamond, the carbons are in sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals, which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion; on the other hand, graphite is composed of sheets of carbons in sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals, where each carbon is bonded covalently to only three others. These sheets are held together by much weaker [[van der Waals force]]s, and this discrepancy translates to large macroscopic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinel-4mb4c.jpg|Contact twins, as seen in [[spinel]]|left|thumb]]

[[Crystal twinning|Twinning]] is the intergrowth of two or more crystals of a single mineral species. The geometry of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of twins, including contact twins, reticulated twins, geniculated twins, penetration twins, cyclic twins, and polysynthetic twins. Contact, or simple twins, consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel. Reticulated twins, common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin. Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped [[staurolite]] twins and Carlsbad twinning in orthoclase. Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis. This type of twinning occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twins through the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, polysynthetic twinning occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale.&lt;ref name="DG4143"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal habit refers to the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to describe this property. Common habits include acicular, which describes needlelike crystals as in [[natrolite]], bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in [[native copper]]), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardness===
{{main article|Mohs scale of mineral hardness}}
[[File:Rough diamond.jpg|right|thumb|Diamond is the hardest natural material, and has a Mohs hardness of 10.]]
The hardness of a mineral defines how much it can resist scratching. This physical property is controlled by the chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral. A mineral's hardness is not necessarily constant for all sides, which is a function of its structure; crystallographic weakness renders some directions softer than others.&lt;ref name="DG2829"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this property exists in kyanite, which has a Mohs hardness of 5½ parallel to [001] but 7 parallel to [100].&lt;ref name="Kyanite"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2303.html|title=Kyanite|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=[[Mindat.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common scale of measurement is the ordinal Mohs hardness scale. Defined by ten indicators, a mineral with a higher index scratches those below it. The scale ranges from talc, a [[phyllosilicate]], to diamond, a carbon polymorph that is the hardest natural material. The scale is provided below:&lt;ref name="DG2829"/&gt;

===Lustre and diaphaneity===
{{main article|Lustre (mineralogy)}}
[[File:Pyrite 2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Pyrite]] has a metallic lustre.]]
Lustre indicates how light reflects from the mineral's surface, with regards to its quality and intensity. There are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories. Metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are [[galena]] and pyrite. Non-metallic lustres include: adamantine, such as in [[diamond]]; vitreous, which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals; pearly, such as in [[talc]] and [[apophyllite]]; resinous, such as members of the garnet group; silky which is common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform [[chrysotile]].&lt;ref name="DG2628"&gt;Dyar and Darby, pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[diaphaneity]] of a mineral describes the ability of light to pass through it. Transparent minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through them. An example of a transparent mineral is [[muscovite]] (potassium mica); some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows. Translucent minerals allow some light to pass, but less than those that are transparent. [[Jadeite]] and [[nephrite]] (mineral forms of [[jade]] are examples of minerals with this property). Minerals that do not allow light to pass are called opaque.&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DG25"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The diaphaneity of a mineral depends on the thickness of the sample. When a mineral is sufficiently thin (e.g., in a [[thin section]] for [[petrography]]), it may become transparent even if that property is not seen in a hand sample. In contrast, some minerals, such as [[hematite]] or pyrite, are opaque even in thin-section.&lt;ref name="DG25" /&gt;

===Colour and streak===
{{main article|Streak (mineralogy)}}
{{double image|right|Quartz-Uvarovite-LTH15C.JPG|150|Grossular-ww51a.jpg|161|Colour is typically not a diagnostic property of minerals. Shown are green [[uvarovite]] (left) and red-pink [[grossular]] (right), both [[garnet]]s. The diagnostic features would include dodecahedral crystals, resinous lustre, and hardness around 7.|||}}

&lt;!--[[File:Tourmaline.xtal.750pix.jpg|Watermelon [[elbaite]]|left|thumb]]--&gt;
Colour is the most obvious property of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by [[electromagnetic radiation]] interacting with electrons (except in the case of [[incandescence]], which does not apply to minerals).&lt;ref name="DG131144"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 131–44&lt;/ref&gt; Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic.&lt;ref name="B72"&gt;{{harvnb|Busbey et al.|2007}}, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DG24"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such minerals are [[malachite]] (green) and [[azurite]] (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] varieties of the mineral [[corundum]].&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt;
The colours of pseudochromatic minerals are the result of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of light waves. Examples include [[labradorite]] and [[bornite]].

In addition to simple body colour, minerals can have various other distinctive optical properties, such as play of colours, [[Asterism (gemmology)|asterism]], [[chatoyancy]], [[iridescence]], tarnish, and [[pleochroism]]. Several of these properties involve variability in colour. Play of colour, such as in [[opal]], results in the sample reflecting different colours as it is turned, while pleochroism describes the change in colour as light passes through a mineral in a different orientation. Iridescence is a variety of the play of colours where light scatters off a coating on the surface of crystal, cleavage planes, or off layers having minor gradations in chemistry.&lt;ref name="DG2426"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the play of colours in opal is caused by light refracting from ordered microscopic silica spheres within its physical structure.&lt;ref name="B73"&gt;{{harvnb|Busbey et al.|2007}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Chatoyancy ("cat's eye") is the wavy banding of colour that is observed as the sample is rotated; asterism, a variety of chatoyancy, gives the appearance of a star on the mineral grain. The latter property is particularly common in gem-quality corundum.&lt;ref name="DG2426" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B73"/&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Streak plate with Pyrite and Rhodochrosite.jpg|thumb|Streak plates with [[pyrite]] (left) and [[rhodochrosite]] (right)|left]]--&gt;
The streak of a mineral refers to the colour of a mineral in powdered form, which may or may not be identical to its body colour.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; The most common way of testing this property is done with a streak plate, which is made out of porcelain and coloured either white or black. The streak of a mineral is independent of trace elements&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; or any weathering surface.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; A common example of this property is illustrated with [[hematite]], which is coloured black, silver, or red in hand sample, but has a cherry-red&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; to reddish-brown streak.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; Streak is more often distinctive for metallic minerals, in contrast to non-metallic minerals whose body colour is created by allochromatic elements.&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; Streak testing is constrained by the hardness of the mineral, as those harder than 7 powder the ''streak plate'' instead.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt;

===Cleavage, parting, fracture, and tenacity===
{{main article|Cleavage (crystal)|Fracture (mineralogy)}}
[[File:Biotite-Orthoclase-229808.jpg|left|thumb|Perfect basal cleavage as seen in [[biotite]] (black), and good cleavage seen in the matrix (pink [[orthoclase]]).]]
By definition, minerals have a characteristic atomic arrangement. Weakness in this crystalline structure causes planes of weakness, and the breakage of a mineral along such planes is termed cleavage. The quality of cleavage can be described based on how cleanly and easily the mineral breaks; common descriptors, in order of decreasing quality, are "perfect", "good", "distinct", and "poor". In particularly transparent minerals, or in thin-section, cleavage can be seen as a series of parallel lines marking the planar surfaces when viewed from the side. Cleavage is not a universal property among minerals; for example, quartz, consisting of extensively interconnected silica tetrahedra, does not have a crystallographic weakness which would allow it to cleave. In contrast, micas, which have perfect basal cleavage, consist of sheets of silica tetrahedra which are very weakly held together.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

As cleavage is a function of crystallography, there are a variety of cleavage types. Cleavage occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. Basal cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the [[mica]]s. Two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or [[rhodochrosite]], it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in [[fluorite]] and diamond, and [[sphalerite]] has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"/&gt;

Minerals with many cleavages might not break equally well in all of the directions; for example, calcite has good cleavage in three directions, but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction, and poor cleavage in two other directions. Angles between cleavage planes vary between minerals. For example, as the amphiboles are double-chain silicates and the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates, the angle between their cleavage planes is different. The pyroxenes cleave in two directions at approximately 90°, whereas the amphiboles distinctively cleave in two directions separated by approximately 120° and 60°. The cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer, which is similar to a protractor.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"/&gt;

Parting, sometimes called "false cleavage", is similar in appearance to cleavage but is instead produced by structural defects in the mineral, as opposed to systematic weakness. Parting varies from crystal to crystal of a mineral, whereas all crystals of a given mineral will cleave if the atomic structure allows for that property. In general, parting is caused by some stress applied to a crystal. The sources of the stresses include deformation (e.g. an increase in pressure), exsolution, or twinning. Minerals that often display parting include the pyroxenes, hematite, magnetite, and corundum.&lt;ref name="DG39-40"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

When a mineral is broken in a direction that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in [[native copper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenacity is related to both cleavage and fracture. Whereas fracture and cleavage describes the surfaces that are created when a mineral is broken, tenacity describes how resistant a mineral is to such breaking. Minerals can be described as brittle, ductile, malleable, sectile, flexible, or elastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific gravity===
[[File:Calcite-Galena-elm56c.jpg|right|thumb|Galena, PbS, is a mineral with a high specific gravity.]]
[[Specific gravity]] numerically describes the [[density]] of a mineral. The dimensions of density are mass divided by volume with units: kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Specific gravity measures how much water a mineral sample displaces. Defined as the quotient of the mass of the sample and difference between the weight of the sample in air and its corresponding weight in water, specific gravity is a unitless ratio. Among most minerals, this property is not diagnostic. Rock forming minerals – typically silicates or occasionally carbonates – have a specific gravity of 2.5–3.5.&lt;ref name="DG4344"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

High specific gravity is a diagnostic property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates to a change in specific gravity. Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher specific gravity as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre tend to have higher specific gravities than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has a specific gravity of 5.26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1856.html|title=Hematite|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[galena]], PbS, has a specific gravity of 7.2–7.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1641.html|title=Galena|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a result of their high iron and lead content, respectively. A very high specific gravity becomes very pronounced in [[native metal]]s; [[kamacite]], an iron-nickel alloy common in [[iron meteorite]]s has a specific gravity of 7.9,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/data/Kamacite.shtml#.WsQTQGbn9SM|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Webmineral.com|title=Kamacite|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gold has an observed specific gravity between 15 and 19.3.&lt;ref name="DG4344" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1720.html|title=Gold|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other properties===
[[File:Carnotite-201050.jpg|left|thumb|Carnotite (yellow) is a radioactive uranium-bearing mineral.]]
Other properties can be used to diagnose minerals. These are less general, and apply to specific minerals.

Dropping dilute acid (often 10% [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]]) onto a mineral aids in distinguishing carbonates from other mineral classes. The acid reacts with the carbonate ([CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) group, which causes the affected area to [[effervesce]], giving off [[carbon dioxide]] gas. This test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original crystal form or powdered form. An example of this test is done when distinguishing calcite from [[dolomite]], especially within rocks (limestone and dolostone respectively). Calcite immediately effervesces in acid, whereas acid must be applied to powdered dolomite (often to a scratched surface in a rock), for it to effervesce.&lt;ref name="DG4445"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeolite]] minerals will not effervesce in acid; instead, they become frosted after 5–10 minutes, and if left in acid for a day, they dissolve or become a silica gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/collectors_corner/id/mineral_id_keyi11.htm|title=Mineral Identification Key: Radioactivity, Magnetism, Acid Reactions|publisher=[[Mineralogical Society of America]]|accessdate=2012-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922231836/http://minsocam.org/MSA/collectors_corner/id/mineral_id_keyi11.htm|archivedate=2012-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When tested, [[magnetism]] is a very conspicuous property of minerals. Among common minerals, [[magnetite]] exhibits this property strongly, and magnetism is also present, albeit not as strongly, in [[pyrrhotite]] and [[ilmenite]].&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt; Some minerals exhibit electrical properties – for example, quartz is piezoelectric – but electrical properties are rarely used as diagnostic criteria for minerals because of incomplete data and natural variation.&lt;ref name="Helman2016"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Symmetry-based electricity in minerals and rocks: A summary of extant data, with examples of centrosymmetric minerals that exhibit pyro- and piezoelectricity | author=Helman, Daniel S. | journal=Periodico di Mineralogia | year=2016 | volume=85 | doi=10.2451/2016PM590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minerals can also be tested for taste or smell. Halite, NaCl, is table salt; its potassium-bearing counterpart, [[sylvite]], has a pronounced bitter taste. Sulfides have a characteristic smell, especially as samples are fractured, reacting, or powdered.&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt;

[[Radioactivity]] is a rare property; minerals may be composed of radioactive elements. They could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in [[uraninite]], [[autunite]], and [[carnotite]], or as trace impurities. In the latter case, the decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal; the result, termed a ''radioactive halo'' or ''[[pleochroic halo]]'', is observable with various techniques, such as thin-section petrography.&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt;

==Classification==
As the composition of the Earth's crust is dominated by silicon and oxygen, silicate elements are by far the most important class of minerals in terms of rock formation and diversity. However, non-silicate minerals are of great economic importance, especially as ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 641&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-silicate minerals are subdivided into several other classes by their dominant chemistry, which includes native elements, sulfides, halides, oxides and hydroxides, carbonates and nitrates, borates, sulfates, phosphates, and organic compounds. Most non-silicate mineral species are rare (constituting in total 8% of the Earth's crust), although some are relatively common, such as calcite, [[pyrite]], [[magnetite]], and [[hematite]]. There are two major structural styles observed in non-silicates: close-packing and silicate-like linked tetrahedra. [[Close-packing of equal spheres|close-packed structures]] is a way to densely pack atoms while minimizing interstitial space. Hexagonal close-packing involves stacking layers where every other layer is the same ("ababab"), whereas cubic close-packing involves stacking groups of three layers ("abcabcabc"). Analogues to linked silica tetrahedra include SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (sulfate), PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (phosphate), AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (arsenate), and VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (vanadate). The non-silicates have great economic importance, as they concentrate elements more than the silicate minerals do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 641–43&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest grouping of minerals by far are the [[Silicate minerals|silicates]]; most rocks are composed of greater than 95% silicate minerals, and over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of these minerals.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The two main constituents of silicates are silicon and oxygen, which are the two most abundant elements in the Earth's crust. Other common elements in silicate minerals correspond to other common elements in the Earth's crust, such as aluminium, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium, and potassium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Some important rock-forming silicates include the [[feldspar]]s, quartz, [[olivine]]s, [[pyroxene]]s, [[amphibole]]s, [[garnet]]s, and [[mica]]s.

===Silicates===
{{main article|Silicate minerals}}
[[File:Aegirine-233494.jpg|right|thumb|[[Aegirine]], an iron-sodium clinopyroxene, is part of the inosilicate subclass.]]
The base unit of a silicate mineral is the [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedron. In the vast majority of cases, silicon is in four-fold or tetrahedral coordination with oxygen. In very high-pressure situations, silicon will be in six-fold or octahedral coordination, such as in the [[perovskite structure]] or the quartz polymorph [[stishovite]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In the latter case, the mineral no longer has a silicate structure, but that of [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and its associated group, which are simple oxides. These silica tetrahedra are then polymerized to some degree to create various structures, such as one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The basic silicate mineral where no polymerization of the tetrahedra has occurred requires other elements to balance out the base 4- charge. In other silicate structures, different combinations of elements are required to balance out the resultant negative charge. It is common for the Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to be substituted by  Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; because of similarity in ionic radius and charge; in those cases, the [AlO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra form the same structures as do the unsubstituted tetrahedra, but their charge-balancing requirements are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 104–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of polymerization can be described by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra, thus tetrahedra share no corners. Disilicates (or sorosilicates) have two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom. Inosilicates are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates have two or three shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; in the case of double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result. Framework silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners. The ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 104–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The silicate subclasses are described below in order of decreasing polymerization.

====Tectosilicates====
[[File:Natroliteinde1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Natrolite]] is a mineral series in the zeolite group; this sample has a very prominent acicular crystal habit.]]
Tectosilicates, also known as framework silicates, have the highest degree of polymerization. With all corners of a tetrahedra shared, the silicon:oxygen ratio becomes 1:2. Examples are quartz, the [[feldspar]]s, [[feldspathoid]]s, and the [[zeolite]]s. Framework silicates tend to be particularly chemically stable as a result of strong covalent bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman and Cole, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, [[quartz]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most abundant mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] at high temperatures, high-pressure [[coesite]], and ultra-high pressure [[stishovite]]. The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed so much that it had changed from a silicate structure to that of [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz. Its counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573&amp;nbsp;°C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a "kinking" of bonds; this change in structure gives β-quartz greater symmetry than α-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (β) and low quartz (α).&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 578–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldspars are the most abundant group in the Earth's crust, at about 50%. In the feldspars, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; substitutes for Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, which creates a charge imbalance that must be accounted for by the addition of cations. The base structure becomes either [AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  There are 22 mineral species of feldspars, subdivided into two major subgroups – alkali and plagioclase – and two less common groups – [[celsian]] and [[banalsite]]. The alkali feldspars are most commonly in a series between potassium-rich orthoclase and sodium-rich [[albite]]; in the case of plagioclase, the most common series ranges from albite to calcium-rich [[anorthite]]. Crystal twinning is common in feldspars, especially polysynthetic twins in plagioclase and Carlsbad twins in alkali feldspars. If the latter subgroup cools slowly from a melt, it forms exsolution lamellae because the two components – orthoclase and albite – are unstable in solid solution. Exsolution can be on a scale from microscopic to readily observable in hand-sample; perthitic texture forms when Na-rich feldspar exsolve in a K-rich host. The opposite texture (antiperthitic), where K-rich feldspar exsolves in a Na-rich host, is very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 583–88&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldspathoids are structurally similar to feldspar, but differ in that they form in Si-deficient conditions, which allows for further substitution by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, feldspathoids cannot be associated with quartz. A common example of a feldspathoid is [[nepheline]] ((Na, K)AlSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); compared to alkali feldspar, nepheline has an Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 1:2, as opposed to 1:6 in the feldspar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 588&lt;/ref&gt; Zeolites often have distinctive crystal habits, occurring in needles, plates, or blocky masses. They form in the presence of water at low temperatures and pressures, and have channels and voids in their structure. Zeolites have several industrial applications, especially in waste water treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 589–93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phyllosilicates====
[[File:Muscovite-Albite-122886.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|Muscovite, a mineral species in the mica group, within the phyllosilicate subclass]]
Phyllosilicates consist of sheets of polymerized tetrahedra. They are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important examples include the [[mica]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and the [[kaolinite]]-[[Serpentine group|serpentine]] groups. The sheets are weakly bound by [[van der Waals forces]] or [[hydrogen bond]]s, which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balance out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked in a variety of combinations to create phyllosilicate groups. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The kaolinite-serpentine group consists of T-O stacks (the 1:1 clay minerals); their hardness ranges from 2 to 4, as the sheets are held by hydrogen bonds. The 2:1 clay minerals (pyrophyllite-talc) consist of T-O-T stacks, but they are softer (hardness from 1 to 2), as they are instead held together by van der Waals forces. These two groups of minerals are subgrouped by octahedral occupation; specifically, kaolinite and pyrophyllite are dioctahedral whereas serpentine and talc trioctahedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 110–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Micas are also T-O-T-stacked phyllosilicates, but differ from the other T-O-T and T-O-stacked subclass members in that they incorporate aluminium into the tetrahedral sheets (clay minerals have Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in octahedral sites). Common examples of micas are [[muscovite]], and the [[biotite]] series. The chlorite group is related to mica group, but a [[brucite]]-like (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) layer between the T-O-T stacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 602–05&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their chemical structure, phyllosilicates typically have flexible, elastic, transparent layers that are electrical insulators and can be split into very thin flakes. Micas can be used in electronics as insulators, in construction, as optical filler, or even cosmetics. Chrysotile, a species of serpentine, is the most common mineral species in industrial asbestos, as it is less dangerous in terms of health than the amphibole asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 593–95&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inosilicates====
[[File:Asbestos with muscovite.jpg|left|thumb|[[Asbestiform]] [[tremolite]], part of the amphibole group in the inosilicate subclass]]
Inosilicates consist of tetrahedra repeatedly bonded in chains. These chains can be single, where a tetrahedron is bound to two others to form a continuous chain; alternatively, two chains can be merged to create double-chain silicates. Single-chain silicates have a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:3 (e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;), whereas the double-chain variety has a ratio of 4:11, e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;. Inosilicates contain two important rock-forming mineral groups; single-chain silicates are most commonly [[pyroxene]]s, while double-chain silicates are often [[amphibole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-order chains exist (e.g. three-member, four-member, five-member chains, etc.) but they are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/strunz/strunz.php?class=09&amp;subclass=09.D|title=09.D Inosilicates|publisher=Webmineral.com|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyroxene group consists of 21 mineral species.&lt;ref name="DG112" /&gt; Pyroxenes have a general structure formula of XY(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), where X is an octahedral site, while Y can vary in coordination number from six to eight. Most varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to balance the negative charge on the backbone. Pyroxenes are common in the Earth's crust (about 10%) and are a key constituent of mafic igneous rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}} pp. 612–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphiboles have great variability in chemistry, described variously as a "mineralogical garbage can" or a "mineralogical shark swimming a sea of elements". The backbone of the amphiboles is the [Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group ([OH]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), although it can be replaced by a fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 606–12&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="DG112"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Several amphibole mineral species can have an [[asbestiform]] crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as [[asbestosis]]; amphibole asbestos ([[anthophyllite]], [[tremolite]], [[actinolite]], [[grunerite]], and [[riebeckite]]) are considered more dangerous than [[chrysotile]] serpentine asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 611–12&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyclosilicates====
[[File:Elbaite-121353.jpg|right|thumb|An example of elbaite, a species of tourmaline, with distinctive colour banding.]]
Cyclosilicates, or ring silicates, have a ratio of silicon to oxygen of 1:3. Six-member rings are most common, with a base structure of [Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;; examples include the [[tourmaline]] group and [[beryl]]. Other ring structures exist, with 3, 4, 8, 9, 12 having been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 113–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyclosilicates tend to be strong, with elongated, striated crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourmalines have a very complex chemistry that can be described by a general formula XY&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Z&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W. The T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; is the basic ring structure, where T is usually Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, but substitutable by Al&lt;sub&gt;3+&lt;/sub&gt; or B&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Tourmalines can be subgrouped by the occupancy of the X site, and from there further subdivided by the chemistry of the W site. The Y and Z sites can accommodate a variety of cations, especially various transition metals; this variability in structural transition metal content gives the tourmaline group greater variability in colour. Other cyclosilicates include beryl, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;, whose varieties include the gemstones emerald (green) and aquamarine (bluish). [[Cordierite]] is structurally similar to beryl, and is a common metamorphic mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 617–21&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sorosilicates====
[[File:Epidote Oisans.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Epidote often has a distinctive pistachio-green colour.]]
Sorosilicates, also termed disilicates, have tetrahedron-tetrahedron bonding at one oxygen, which results in a 2:7 ratio of silicon to oxygen. The resultant common structural element is the [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt; group. The most common disilicates by far are members of the [[epidote]] group. Epidotes are found in variety of geologic settings, ranging from mid-ocean ridge to granites to [[pelite|metapelites]]. Epidotes are built around the structure [(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;10−&lt;/sup&gt; structure; for example, the mineral ''species'' epidote has calcium, aluminium, and ferric iron to charge balance: Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al)(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)O(OH). The presence of iron as Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; helps understand oxygen [[fugacity]], which in turn is a significant factor in petrogenesis.&lt;ref name="DG612-627"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 612–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of sorosilicates include [[lawsonite]], a  metamorphic mineral forming in the [[blueschist]] facies (subduction zone setting with low temperature and high pressure), [[vesuvianite]], which takes up a significant amount of calcium in its chemical structure.&lt;ref name="DG612-627" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 565–73&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthosilicates====
[[File:Andradite-172390.jpg|right|thumb|Black andradite, an end-member of the orthosilicate garnet group.]]
Orthosilicates consist of isolated tetrahedra that are charge-balanced by other cations.&lt;ref name="DG116-117"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 116–17&lt;/ref&gt; Also termed nesosilicates, this type of silicate has a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:4 (e.g. SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Typical orthosilicates tend to form blocky equant crystals, and are fairly hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; Several rock-forming minerals are part of this subclass, such as the aluminosilicates, the olivine group, and the garnet group.

The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; – are structurally composed of one [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedron, and one Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; can be in six-fold coordination (kyanite), five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as [[tephroite]], Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 574–75&lt;/ref&gt; The garnet group has a general formula of X&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Y position: [[pyrope]] (Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[almandine]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[spessartine]] (Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The ugrandite garnets have Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the X position: [[uvarovite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[grossular]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[andradite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.&lt;ref name="DG116-117"/&gt;

Other orthosilicates include [[zircon]], [[staurolite]], and [[topaz]]. Zircon (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is useful in geochronology as the Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; can be substituted by U&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;; furthermore, because of its very resistant structure, it is difficult to reset it as a chronometer. Staurolite is a common metamorphic intermediate-grade index mineral. It has a particularly complicated crystal structure that was only fully described in 1986. Topaz (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(F, OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, often found in granitic pegmatites associated with [[tourmaline]], is a common gemstone mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 627–34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-silicates===

====Native elements====
{{main article|Native element minerals}}
[[File:Gold-mz4b.jpg|left|thumb|Native gold. Rare specimen of stout crystals growing off of a central stalk, size 3.7 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm, from Venezuela.]]
[[native element minerals|Native elements]] are those that are not chemically bonded to other elements. This mineral group includes [[native metal]]s, semi-metals, and non-metals, and various alloys and solid solutions. The metals are held together by metallic bonding, which confers distinctive physical properties such as their shiny metallic lustre, ductility and malleability, and electrical conductivity. Native elements are subdivided into groups by their structure or chemical attributes.

The gold group, with a cubic close-packed structure, includes metals such as gold, silver, and copper. The platinum group is similar in structure to the gold group. The iron-nickel group is characterized by several iron-nickel alloy species. Two examples are [[kamacite]] and [[taenite]], which are found in iron meteorites; these species differ by the amount of Ni in the alloy; kamacite has less than 5–7% nickel and is a variety of [[telluric iron|native iron]], whereas the nickel content of taenite ranges from 7–37%. Arsenic group minerals consist of semi-metals, which have only some metallic traits; for example, they lack the malleability of metals. Native carbon occurs in two allotropes, graphite and diamond; the latter forms at very high pressure in the mantle, which gives it a much stronger structure than graphite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 644–48&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfides====
{{main article|Sulfide minerals}}
[[File:Cinnabar on Dolomite.jpg|right|thumb|Red cinnabar (HgS), a mercury ore, on dolomite.]]
The [[sulfide minerals]] are chemical compounds of one or more metals or semimetals with a sulfur; tellurium, arsenic, or selenium can substitute for the sulfur. Sulfides tend to be soft, brittle minerals with a high specific gravity. Many powdered sulfides, such as pyrite, have a sulfurous smell when powdered. Sulfides are susceptible to weathering, and many readily dissolve in water; these dissolved minerals can be later redeposited, which creates enriched secondary ore deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfides are classified by the ratio of the metal or semimetal to the sulfur, such as M:S equal to 2:1, or 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 649&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[sulfide mineral]]s are economically important as metal [[ore]]s; examples include [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), an ore of zinc, [[galena]] (PbS), an ore of lead, [[cinnabar]] (HgS), an ore of mercury, and [[molybdenite]] (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an ore of molybdenum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 651–54&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is the most commonly occurring sulfide, and can be found in most geological environments. It is not, however, an ore of iron, but can be instead oxidized to produce sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 654&lt;/ref&gt; Related to the sulfides are the rare [[Sulfosalt mineral|sulfosalts]], in which a metallic element is bonded to sulfur and a semimetal such as [[antimony]], [[arsenic]], or [[bismuth]]. Like the sulfides, sulfosalts are typically soft, heavy, and brittle minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oxides====
{{main article|Oxide minerals}}
[[Oxide minerals]] are divided into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The [[periclase]] group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include [[cuprite]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as [[corundum]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[hematite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the chief ore of [[titanium]]; other examples include [[cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ore of [[tin]]), and [[pyrolusite]] (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ore of [[manganese]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 400–03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 657–60&lt;/ref&gt;  In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Bauxite]]s are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals [[diaspore]], [[gibbsite]], and [[bohmite]]; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 663–64&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the [[spinel group|spinels]], with a general formula of X&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Examples of species include [[spinel]] (MgAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chromite]] (FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two [[oxidation state]]s (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which makes it a multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 660–63&lt;/ref&gt;

====Halides====

[[File:Halite-Nahcolite-51411.jpg|left|thumb|Pink cubic [[halite]] (NaCl; halide class) crystals on a [[nahcolite]] matrix (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; a carbonate, and mineral form of sodium bicarbonate, used as [[baking soda]]).]]

The [[halide minerals]] are compounds in which a [[halogen]] (fluorine, chlorine, iodine, or bromine) is the main anion. These minerals tend to be soft, weak, brittle, and water-soluble. Common examples of halides include halite (NaCl, table salt), [[sylvite]] (KCl), [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Halite and sylvite commonly form as [[evaporite]]s, and can be dominant minerals in chemical sedimentary rocks. [[Cryolite]], Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is a key mineral in the extraction of aluminium from [[bauxite]]s; however, as the only significant occurrence at [[Ivittuut]], [[Greenland]], in a granitic pegmatite, was depleted, synthetic cryolite can be made from fluorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 425–30&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbonates====
{{main article|Carbonate minerals}}
The [[carbonate minerals]] are those in which the main anionic group is carbonate, [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbonates tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates. The reaction of acid with carbonates, most commonly found as the polymorph calcite and [[aragonite]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral, which is a key in the formation of limestone caves, features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites, and [[karst]] landforms. Carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments. The carbonate group is structurally a triangle, where a central C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is surrounded by three O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; anions; different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt; The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, which is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble. Calcite, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, can have a high magnesium impurity. Under high-Mg conditions, its polymorph aragonite will form instead; the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an [[aragonite sea|aragonite]] or [[calcite sea]], depending on which mineral preferentially forms. [[Dolomite]] is a double carbonate, with the formula CaMg(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Secondary dolomitization of limestone is common, in which calcite or aragonite are converted to dolomite; this reaction increases pore space (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite), which can create a reservoir for oil and gas. These two mineral species are members of eponymous mineral groups: the calcite group includes carbonates with the general formula XCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the dolomite group constitutes minerals with the general formula XY(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 668–69&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfates====
{{main article|Sulfate minerals}}
[[File:Roses des Sables Tunisie.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Gypsum desert rose]]
The [[sulfate mineral]]s all contain the sulfate anion, [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. They tend to be transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfate minerals commonly form as [[evaporite]]s, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters. Sulfates can also be found in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 456–57&lt;/ref&gt; or as oxidation products of sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 674&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is [[gypsum]], CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;⋅2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form [[Desert rose (crystal)|desert rose]]s. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is [[anhydrite]]; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include [[barite]] (BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Celestine (mineral)|celestine]] (SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[anglesite]] (PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); anhydrite is not part of the barite group, as the smaller Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is only in eight-fold coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 672–73&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phosphates====
{{main article|Phosphate minerals}}
The [[phosphate minerals]] are characterized by the tetrahedral [PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; unit, although the structure can be generalized, and phosphorus is replaced by antimony, arsenic, or vanadium. The most common phosphate is the [[apatite]] group; common species within this group are fluorapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F), chlorapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) and hydroxylapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)). Minerals in this group are the main crystalline constituents of teeth and bones in vertebrates. The relatively abundant [[monazite]] group has a general structure of ATO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where T is phosphorus or arsenic, and A is often a [[rare-earth element]] (REE). Monazite is important in two ways: first, as a REE "sink", it can sufficiently concentrate these elements to become an ore; secondly, monazite group elements can incorporate relatively large amounts of uranium and thorium, which can be used in [[monazite geochronology]] to date the rock based on the decay of the U and Th to lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 675–80&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organic minerals====
{{main article|Organic mineral}}
The Strunz classification includes a class for [[Strunz classification#Class: organic compounds|organic minerals]]. These rare compounds contain [[Organic compound|organic carbon]], but can be formed by a geologic process. For example, [[whewellite]], CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;⋅H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is an [[oxalate]] that can be deposited in hydrothermal ore veins. While hydrated calcium oxalate can be found in coal seams and other sedimentary deposits involving organic matter, the hydrothermal occurrence is not considered to be related to biological activity.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681"/&gt;

==Astrobiology==
It has been suggested that [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] could be important indicators of [[extraterrestrial life]] and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on the planet [[Mars]].  Furthermore, [[Organic compounds (minerals)|organic components]] ([[biosignature]]s) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and [[Biotic material|biotic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=SSG &gt;{{Cite book |editor2-first=David |editor2-last= Beaty |contribution=Final report of the MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group (AFL-SSG)| title=The Astrobiology Field Laboratory |editor1-first=Andrew |editor1-last=Steele |publisher=[[Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group]] (MEPAG) – NASA |place= |page=72 |date=September 26, 2006 |id= |contribution-url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/AFL_SSG_WHITE_PAPER_v3.doc |format=.doc |accessdate=2009-07-22 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2014, NASA reported that current studies by the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'']] and [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] [[Mars rover|rovers]] on Mars will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a [[biosphere]] based on [[autotroph]]ic, [[chemotroph]]ic and/or [[Lithotroph#Chemolithotrophs|chemolithoautotrophic]] [[microorganism]]s, as well as ancient water, including [[Lacustrine plain|fluvio-lacustrine environments]] ([[plain]]s related to ancient [[river]]s or [[lake]]s) that may have been [[Planetary habitability|habitable]].&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grotzinger |first=John P. |title=Introduction to Special Issue – Habitability, Taphonomy, and the Search for Organic Carbon on Mars |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=January 24, 2014 |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=386–87 |doi=10.1126/science.1249944 |pmid=24458635 |bibcode=2014Sci...343..386G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124special"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Various |title=Exploring Martian Habitability |date=January 24, 2014 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=345–452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Various |title=Special Collection – Curiosity – Exploring Martian Habitability |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/extra/curiosity/index.xhtml |date=January 24, 2014 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124c"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grotzinger, J.P. |display-authors=etal |title=A Habitable Fluvio-Lacustrine Environment at Yellowknife Bay, Gale Crater, Mars |date=January 24, 2014 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=343 |number=6169 |doi=10.1126/science.1242777 |pmid=24324272 |pages=1242777 |citeseerx=10.1.1.455.3973 |bibcode=2014Sci...343A.386G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The search for evidence of [[Planetary habitability|habitability]], [[taphonomy]] (related to [[fossils]]), and [[organic carbon]] on the planet [[Mars]] is now a primary [[NASA]] objective.&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124special"/&gt;

'''Patterns in nature''' are visible regularities of form found in the natural world. These [[patterns]] recur in different contexts and can sometimes be [[modelled mathematically]]. Natural patterns include [[symmetries]], [[trees]], [[spirals]], [[meanders]], [[wave]]s, [[foams]], [[tessellations]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=3}} Early [[Greek philosophers]] studied pattern, with [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]] attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.

In the 19th century, Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] examined [[soap film]]s, leading him to formulate the concept of a [[minimal surface]]. German biologist and artist [[Ernst Haeckel]] painted hundreds of [[Marine biology|marine organisms]] to emphasise their [[symmetry]]. Scottish biologist [[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] predicted mechanisms of [[morphogenesis]] which give rise to [[Turing patterns|patterns]] of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] and French American mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] showed how the mathematics of [[fractals]] could create plant growth patterns.

[[Mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] can explain patterns in nature at different levels. Patterns in living things are explained by the [[biology|biological]] processes of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]]. Studies of [[pattern formation]] make use of [[computer models]] to simulate a wide range of patterns.

==History==
[[File:Cycas circinalis male cone in Olomouc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fibonacci]] patterns occur widely in plant structures, including this cone of queen sago, ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'']]

Early Greek philosophers attempted to explain order in [[nature]], anticipating modern concepts. [[Plato]] (c. 427 – c. 347 BC) — looking only at his work on natural patterns — argued for the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. He considered these to consist of [[Theory of Forms|ideal forms]] ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}} ''eidos'': "form") of which physical objects are never more than imperfect copies. Thus, a flower may be roughly circular, but it is never a perfect mathematical circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ | title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University | work=Platonism in Metaphysics | origyear=2004 | date=7 April 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2012 | author=Balaguer, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] explained patterns in nature like the harmonies of music as arising from number, which he took to be the basic constituent of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things. [[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics 1–5 '', cc. 350 BC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] to an extent anticipated [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s evolutionary explanation for the structures of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle reports Empedocles arguing that, "[w]herever, then, everything turned out as it would have if it were happening for a purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way; but where this did not happen, the creatures perished." ''The Physics'', B8, 198b29 in Kirk, et al., 304).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1202, [[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250) introduced the Fibonacci number sequence to the western world with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Parmanand. ''Acharya Hemachandra and the (so called) Fibonacci Numbers''. Math. Ed. Siwan, 20(1):28–30, 1986. {{issn|0047-6269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibonacci gave an (unrealistic) biological example, on the growth in numbers of a theoretical [[rabbit]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Knott | first = Ron | title = Fibonacci's Rabbits | url=http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat.html#Rabbits | publisher =[[University of Surrey]] Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1658, the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]] discussed "how Nature Geometrizeth" in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'', citing [[Pythagorean numerology]] involving the number 5, and the [[Platonic form]] of the [[quincunx]] pattern. The discourse's central chapter features examples and observations of the [[quincunx]] in botany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Browne, Thomas |authorlink=Sir Thomas Browne |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden3.html |title=How Nature Geometrizeth |work=[[The Garden of Cyrus]] |date=1658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (1860–1948) published his book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. His description of [[phyllotaxis]] and the [[Fibonacci sequence]], the mathematical relationships in the spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of [[animal horn]]s and [[mollusc shell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darcythompson.org/about.html About D'Arcy]. D' Arcy 150. [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of St Andrews]]. Retrieved 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] (1801–1883) formulated the [[Plateau's problem|mathematical problem]] of the existence of a [[minimal surface]] with a given boundary, which is now named after him. He studied soap films intensively, formulating [[Plateau's laws]] which describe the structures formed by films in foams.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

The German psychologist [[Adolf Zeising]] (1810–1876) claimed that the [[golden ratio]] was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branching patterns of their veins and nerves, as well as in the geometry of [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Proportion | author=Padovan, Richard | authorlink=Richard Padovan | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=1999 | isbn=978-0-419-22780-9 | pages=305–306 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vk_CQULdAssC&amp;pg=PA306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nexus Network Journal | first=Richard | last=Padovan | authorlink=Richard Padovan | title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture | volume=4 | pages=113–122 | doi=10.1007/s00004-001-0008-7 | date=2002 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Adolf | last=Zeising | title=Neue Lehre van den Proportionen des meschlischen Körpers |date=1854 | page=preface | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) painted beautiful illustrations of marine organisms, in particular [[Radiolaria]], emphasising their [[symmetry]] to support his faux-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theories of evolution.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=41}}

The American photographer [[Wilson Bentley]] (1865–1931) took the first micrograph of a [[snowflake]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography | volume=1 | first=John | last=Hannavy | publisher=CRC Press | date=2007 | isbn=978-0-415-97235-2 | page=149 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=PJ8DHBay4_EC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=wilson+bentley+january+15#v=onepage&amp;q=wilson%20bentley%20january%2015&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drcy.svg|thumb|[[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth and form in his 1917 book]]
In 1952, [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954), better known for his work on computing and [[codebreaking]], wrote ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'', an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Turing | first= A. M. | authorlink=Alan Turing | title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume = 237 | pages = 37–72 | date = 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | issue= 641| bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s, in particular the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns (dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s") of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 247–250}}

In 1968, the Hungarian theoretical biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) developed the [[L-system]], a [[formal grammar]] which can be used to model [[plant development|plant growth patterns]] in the style of [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=L&gt;[[Rozenberg, Grzegorz]]; Salomaa, Arto. ''The Mathematical Theory of L Systems''. [[Academic Press]], New York, 1980. {{isbn|0-12-597140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-systems have an [[alphabet]] of symbols that can be combined using [[Formal grammar|production rules]] to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Helge von Koch]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and others, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote a famous paper, ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]'', crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the [[fractal]].&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot/&gt;

Living things like [[orchid]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, and the [[Structural coloration|peacock's tail]] have abstract designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match.&lt;ref name=ForbesGuardian&gt;Forbes, Peter. ''All that useless beauty''. The Guardian. Review: Non-fiction. 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, notably in the mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=222}}

[[Mathematics]] seeks to discover and explain abstract patterns or regularities of all kinds.&lt;ref name=Steen&gt;[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]]. ''The Science of Patterns''.

''Mathematics: The Science of Patterns: The Search for Order in Life, Mind and the Universe'' (Scientific American Paperback Library) 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
Visual patterns in nature find explanations in [[chaos theory]], fractals, logarithmic spirals, topology and other mathematical patterns. For example, [[L-system]]s form convincing models of different patterns of tree growth.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;
[[File:Dragon trees.jpg|thumb|The growth patterns of certain trees resemble these [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals.]]

The laws of [[physics]] apply the abstractions of mathematics to the real world, often as if it were [[perfection#Physics and chemistry|perfect]]. For example, a [[crystal]] is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz, Władysław]]. ''Perfection in the Sciences. II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry'', Dialectics and Humanism, vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Visible patterns in nature are governed by [[physical law]]s; for example, [[meander]]s can be explained using [[fluid dynamics]].

In [[biology]], [[natural selection]] can cause the development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including [[camouflage]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]].

=== Symmetry ===

{{further|Symmetry in biology|Floral symmetry|Crystal symmetry}}

[[Symmetry]] is pervasive in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as do the leaves of plants and some flowers such as [[orchid]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=48–49}} Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], the group that includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=64–65}}

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]; each flake's structure forms a record of the varying conditions during its crystallization, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=52}} [[Crystal]]s in general have a variety of symmetries and [[crystal habit]]s; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=82–84}} Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things, including the crown-shaped [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splash]] pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond,{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=60}} and both the [[spheroidal]] shape and rings of a [[planet]] like [[Saturn]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=71}}

Symmetry has a variety of causes. Radial symmetry suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs ([[cephalisation]]), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biocongroup.eu/DA/Calendario_files/Bilateria.pdf | title=Animal Diversity | edition=Third | publisher=McGraw-Hill | work=Chapter 8: Acoelomate Bilateral Animals | date=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Hickman, Cleveland P. | author2=Roberts, Larry S. | author3=Larson, Allan | pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4500143 | title=Ontogeny in the fossil record: diversification of body plans and the evolution of "aberrant" symmetry in Paleozoic echinoderms | author=Sumrall, Colin D. | author2=Wray, Gregory A. | journal=Paleobiology |date=January 2007 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=149–163 |doi=10.1666/06053.1}} &lt;!--http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/06053.1--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees, fractals ===

[[Fractal]]s are infinitely [[self-similarity|self-similar]], iterated mathematical constructs having [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, Benoît B. | title=The fractal geometry of nature| date=1983 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Falconer | first = Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Falconer (mathematician) | title = Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos | last=Briggs | first=John | authorlink= |date= 1992|publisher= Thames and Hudson |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite [[iteration]] is not possible in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of [[fern]]s and [[umbellifer]]s (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including [[bryozoa]], [[coral]]s, [[hydrozoa]] like the [[air fern]], ''Sertularia argentea'', and in non-living things, notably [[electrical discharge]]s. [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying a small number of parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points ([[Internode (botany)|internode]] length), and number of branches per branch point.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;

=== Spirals ===
{{further|phyllotaxis}}

[[Spirals]] are common in plants and in some animals, notably [[molluscs]]. For example, in the [[nautilus]], a cephalopod mollusc, each [[Camera (cephalopod)|chamber]] of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli. ''e: The Story of a Number''. Princeton University Press, 2009. Page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral can be seen as a special case of self-similarity.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=29–32}}

Plant spirals can be seen in [[phyllotaxis]], the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and in the arrangement ([[parastichy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526030701/http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 May 2010 | title=Spiral Lattices &amp; Parastichy | publisher=Smith College | accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of other parts as in [[compositae|composite]] [[flower|flower heads]] and [[seed|seed heads]] like the [[sunflower]] or [[fruit]] structures like the [[pineapple]]&lt;ref name=Kappraff&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | date=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}} and [[salak|snake fruit]], as well as in the pattern of scales in [[pine cones]], where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=13}} Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from [[Fibonacci]] ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In [[hazel]] the ratio is 1/3; in [[apricot]] it is 2/5; in [[pear]] it is 3/8; in [[almond]] it is 5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to geometry|first=H. S. M. |last=Coxeter|author-link =Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|publisher =Wiley|date=1961|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In disc phyllotaxis as in the [[sunflower]] and [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], the florets are arranged in [[Fermat's spiral]] with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the [[golden angle]], 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Prusinkiewicz | first =Przemyslaw | authorlink =Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz |author2=Lindenmayer, Aristid |authorlink2=Aristid Lindenmayer | title =The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants | publisher =Springer-Verlag | date =1990 | pages =101–107 | url =http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#webdocs | isbn = 978-0-387-97297-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy configurations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levitov LS |title=Energetic Approach to Phyllotaxis |journal=Europhys.

Phyllotaxis is controlled by [[protein]]s that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone [[auxin]], which activates [[meristem]] growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 249–250}} From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Kappraff/&gt;

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===

In mathematics, a [[dynamical system]] is chaotic if it is (highly) sensitive to initial conditions (the so-called "[[butterfly effect]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz|first=Edward N. |authorlink=Edward Norton Lorenz |title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |date=March 1963 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2| bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which requires the mathematical properties of [[topological mixing]] and [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |date=1999 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside fractals, [[chaos theory]] ranks as an essentially universal influence on patterns in nature. There is a relationship between chaos and fractals—the ''[[strange attractors]]'' in chaotic systems have a [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruelle, David. ''Chance and Chaos''. Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[cellular automata]], simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s [[Rule 30]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''. Wolfram Media, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vortex street]]s are zigzagging patterns of whirling [[Vortex|vortices]] created by the unsteady [[flow separation|separation of flow]] of a [[fluid]], most often air or water, over obstructing objects.&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{isbn|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{isbn|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth ([[Laminar flow|laminar]]) flow starts to break up when the size of the obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

[[Meander]]s are sinuous bends in rivers or other channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As soon as the path is slightly curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as [[helical flow]] drags material like sand and gravel across the river to the inside of the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so [[erosion]] accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful [[positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | date=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waves, dunes ===

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are sea [[surface wave]]s that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | date=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt; As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create [[dune]]s, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the [[Taklamakan]] desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ | title=Types of Dunes | publisher=USGS | date=29 October 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barchan]]s or crescent dunes are produced by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the [[slip face]] point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the [[angle of repose]] of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand [[avalanche]]s, which is a [[nonlinear]] behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then the addition of a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A. &amp; Archibold, O.W. ''Physical Geography: Science and Systems of the Human Environment''. John Wiley, 4th edition 2008. Page 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like [[soliton|solitary waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schwämmle, V. | author2=Herrman, H.J. | title=Solitary wave behaviour of sand dunes| journal=Nature | volume=426 | issue=Dec. 11 | date=2003 | pages=619–620 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/426619a Abstract] | doi=10.1038/426619a | pmid=14668849|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..619S }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubbles, foam===

A [[soap bubble]] forms a [[sphere]], a [[minimal surface|surface with minimal area]] — the smallest possible surface area for the volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the larger one.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

A [[foam]] is a mass of bubbles; foams of different materials occur in nature. Foams composed of [[soap film]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]] at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back).{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=68}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. [[Lord Kelvin]] identified the problem of the most efficient way to pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]]; the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] adapted the structure for their outer wall in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=73–76}}

At the scale of living [[cell (biology)|cells]], foam patterns are common; [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, [[silicoflagellate]] [[exoskeleton]]s and the calcite skeleton of a [[sea urchin]], ''[[Cidaris rugosa]]'', all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=96–101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artfeb05/cbdiatoms.html | title=Geometry and Pattern in Nature 3: The holes in radiolarian and diatom tests | publisher=Microscopy-UK | date=February 2005 | accessdate=May 28, 2012 | author=Brodie, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeleton of the [[Radiolarian]], ''Aulonia hexagona'', a beautiful marine form drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]], looks as if it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The [[Euler characteristic]] states that for any [[convex polyhedron]], the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a [[Euler characteristic#Soccer ball|soccer ball]], [[Buckminster Fuller]] [[geodesic dome]], or [[fullerene]] molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=51–54}}

=== Tessellations ===
{{main|tessellation}}

[[Tessellation]]s are patterns formed by repeating [[tile]]s all over a flat surface. There are 17 [[wallpaper group]]s of tilings.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book | last=Armstrong | first=M.A. | title=Groups and Symmetry | date=1988 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While common in art and design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social [[wasp]]s, and the wax cells in [[honeycomb]] built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the [[pangolin]], or fruits like the [[salak]] are protected by overlapping scales or [[osteoderms]], these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, ''[[Fritillaria meleagris]]'', have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of [[minerals]] provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite the hundreds of thousands of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a [[crystal]], defined by [[crystal structure]], [[crystal system]], and [[point group]]; for example, there are exactly 14 [[Bravais lattices]] for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;Hook, J.R.; Hall, H.E.

=== Cracks ===

[[Fracture|Cracks]] are linear openings that form in materials to relieve [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. When an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at a node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress in the same direction would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=207}} In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=208}}

===Spots, stripes===

Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; angelfish and zebras are striped.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}} These patterns have an [[evolution]]ary explanation: they have [[Function (biology)|functions]] which increase the chances that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is [[camouflage]];&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; for instance, a [[leopard]] that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is [[Signalling theory|signalling]]&lt;ref name=Wickler/&gt; — for instance, a [[ladybird]] is less likely to be attacked by [[predator]]y birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also [[Aposematism|distastefully bitter or poisonous]], or [[Mimicry|mimics]] other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting [[gene]]s that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}}

===Pattern formation===
{{main|Pattern formation}}

Alan Turing,&lt;ref name=Turing/&gt; and later the mathematical biologist [[James D. Murray|James Murray]],&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a [[reaction-diffusion]] system.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}} The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a [[morphogen]], resulting in the growth of a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be [[feedback]] control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create [[standing wave]] patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a [[chemical oscillator]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}}

Later research has managed to create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=168–180}} [[Richard Prum]]'s activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables to account for the observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots.{{sfn|Rothenberg|2011|pages=93–95}}&lt;ref name=Prum/&gt;{{rp|6}} More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl ''[[Numida meleagris]]'' in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.&lt;ref name=Prum&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.yale.edu/eeb/prum/pdf/Prum%20&amp;%20Williamson%202002.pdf | title=Reaction–diffusion models of within-feather pigmentation patterning | author=Prum, Richard O. |author1link=Richard Prum | author2=Williamson, Scott | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | date=2002 | volume=269 | issue=1493 | pages=781–792 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1896| pmid=11958709 | pmc=1690965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

Patterns can form for other reasons in the [[patterned vegetation|vegetated landscape]] of [[tiger bush]]&lt;ref name=TigerBush&gt;{{cite book | title=Banded vegetation patterning in arid and semiarid environments | publisher=Springer-Verlag | author=Tongway, D.J. | author2=Valentin, C. | author3=Seghieri, J. | last-author-amp=yes | date=2001 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fir wave]]s.&lt;ref name=FirWave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v1/figure_sets/disturb/disturb_back4.html | title=Fir Waves: Regeneration in New England Conifer Forests | publisher=TIEE | date=22 February 2004 | accessdate=26 May 2012 | author=D'Avanzo, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it.&lt;ref name=TigerBush/&gt; Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.&lt;ref name=FirWave/&gt; Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the [[Mima mounds]] of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of [[pocket gopher]]s,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |title=‘Digital gophers’ solve Mima mound mystery |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25259133 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the so-called [[fairy circle]]s of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=The secret of Namibia's 'fairy circles' may be explained at last|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/18/the-secret-of-namibias-fairy-circles-may-be-explained-at-last|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In permafrost soils with an active upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, [[patterned ground]] can form, creating circles, nets, [[ice wedge]] polygons, steps, and stripes. [[Thermal contraction]] causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Permafrost: Patterned Ground |url=http://permafrosttunnel.crrel.usace.army.mil/permafrost/patterned_ground.html |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gyrification|fissured pattern]] that develops on vertebrate brains are caused by a physical process of constrained expansion dependent on two geometric parameters: relative tangential cortical expansion and relative thickness of the [[cerebellar cortex|cortex]]. Similar patterns of [[Gyrus|gyri]] (peaks) and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] (troughs) have been demonstrated in models of the brain starting from smooth, layered gels, with the patterns caused by compressive mechanical forces resulting from the expansion of the outer layer (representing the cortex) after the addition of a solvent. Numerical models in computer simulations support natural and experimental observations that the surface folding patterns increase in larger brains.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-brain-s-bizarre-folding-pattern-re-created-in-a-vat/|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Human Brain's Bizarre Folding Pattern Re-Created in a Vat|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tallinen|first1=Tuoma|last2=Chung|first2=Jun Young|last3=Biggins|first3= John S.|last4=Mahadevan|first4=L.|title=Gyrification from constrained cortical expansion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=35|pages=12667–12672|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Philo'''''  was a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[Society of Humanist Philosophers]] from 1998 to 2014. It is published at the [[Center for Inquiry]] with  assistance from [[Purdue University]]. It focused on the discussion of philosophical issues from an explicitly [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] perspective. The journal published articles, critical discussions, review essays, and book reviews in all fields of  philosophy, and particularly invited work on the philosophical credentials of both naturalism and various supernaturalist alternatives to naturalism. Electronic access to the journal is  provided by the [[Philosophy Documentation Center]].

==History==
Harvard evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] (1961)&lt;ref name="Mayr1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=E|title=Cause and effect in biology|journal=Science|date=1961|volume=134|pages=1501-1506|bibcode=1961Sci...134.1501M|doi=10.1126/science.134.3489.1501}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there are two fundamentally different types of causation in biology, [[Proximate and ultimate causation|‘ultimate’ and ‘proximate’]]. Ultimate causes (e.g. [[natural selection]]) were seen as (i) providing historical accounts for the existence of an organism’s features, and (ii) explaining the function or ‘goal-directedness’ of living beings. In contrast, proximate causes (e.g. [[physiology]]) were seen as explaining how biological systems work. According to Mayr, the evolutionary sciences study ultimate causes and the rest of biology studies proximate causes. In some of his works, Mayr considered these domains autonomous:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The clarification of the biochemical mechanism by which the genetic program is translated into the phenotype tells us absolutely nothing about the steps by which natural selection has built up the particular genetic program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayr, 1980&lt;ref name="Mayr1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=E|editor1-last=Mayr|editor1-first=E|editor2-last=Provine|editor2-first=WB|title=The Evolutionary Synthesis|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA|pages=1-48|chapter=Some thoughts on the history of the evolutionary synthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There has been widespread acceptance of the proximate-ultimate [[dichotomy]] within the evolutionary sciences. However, many biologists, psychologists and philosophers have taken issue with Mayr’s corollary that the [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate-ultimate distinction]] implies that development is irrelevant to evolution. For instance, evolutionary biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proximate-ultimate distinction has given rise to a new confusion, namely, a belief that proximate causes of phenotypic variation have nothing to do with ultimate, evolutionary explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West-Eberhard, 2003&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mayr’s position implied a unidirectional or linear conception of causation for both development and evolution: [[genotypes]] cause [[phenotypes]] (proximate causation), whilst through natural selection, changes in [[Environment (biophysical)|environments]] cause changes in [[organisms]] (ultimate causation). Reciprocal causation was proposed as an alternative to this linear characterization.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt; (see also &lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waddington1957"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=CH|title=The Strategy of the Genes|date=1957|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=D|title=The proximate and the ultimate: past, present, and future|journal=Behav Process|date=1999|volume=46|pages=189-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thierry|first1=B|title=Integrating proximate and ultimate causation: just one more go!|journal=Curr Sci|date=2005|volume=89|pages=1180-1183}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It emphasizes how causation cycles through biological systems recursively, allowing proximate causes to feed back and thereby feature in ultimate explanations. 

==Reciprocal causation in evolutionary biology==
Reciprocal causation features in several explanations within contemporary [[evolutionary biology]], including [[sexual selection]] theory, [[coevolution]], habitat selection, and [[frequency-dependent selection]]. In these examples, the source of selection on a trait coevolves with the trait itself, therefore causation is reciprocal and developmental processes potentially become relevant to evolutionary accounts. For instance, a [[Peafowl|peacock]]’s tail evolves through mating preferences in peahens, and those preferences coevolve with the male trait. The ‘ultimate explanation’ for the male trait is the prior existence of female preferences, proximately manifest in differential peahen [[mate choice]] decisions, whilst the ‘ultimate explanation’ for the peahens’ mating preferences is the prior existence of variation in the peacock’s tail associated with fitness. This example illustrates how reciprocal causation is not a rejection of the proximate-ultimate distinction itself, but instead a rejection of the implication that developmental processes should not feature in evolutionary explanations.

Reciprocal causation also applies in other domains of evolutionary biology. The [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] emphasizes how developmental events, including both the causal effects of environments on organisms (for instance, arising through developmental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]], or [[epigenetic inheritance]]) and the causal effects of organisms on environments (e.g. [[niche construction]]), can direct the course of evolution. Developmental plasticity, niche construction, extra-genetic forms of inheritance and developmental bias are recognized as playing evolutionary roles that cannot be reduced to [[natural selection]] of genetically encoded characters or strategies. Proximate causes are not autonomous from natural selection, but rather feed back to influence the rate and direction of [[adaptive evolution]]. This goes beyond the recognition that [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic processes]] can impose constraints on the action of selection, or that proximate and ultimate processes interact. Rather, developmental processes are also seen as a source of evolutionary novelty, initiators of evolutionary episodes, and co-directors of patterns of evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="Laland2015" /&gt;

==Contention==
Acceptance or rejection of Mayr’s proximate-ultimate distinction may lie at the centre of several major debates within contemporary biology, concerning [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evo devo (evolutionary developmental biology)]], [[niche construction]], [[cultural evolution]], human cooperation, and the [[Origin of language|evolution of language]]. According to some biologists and philosophers, these disputes share a common pattern. On one side are researchers who consider that interaction and feedback processes traditionally characterized as ‘proximate’ have explanatory value for ‘ultimate’ evolutionary questions.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=KN|last2=Uller|first2=T|last3=Feldman|first3=MW|last4=Sterelny|first4=K|last5=Müller|first5=GB|last6=Moczek|first6=A|last7=Jablonka|first7=E|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=FJ|last9=Wray|first9=GA|last10=Hoekstra|first10=HE|last11=Futuyma|first11=DJ|last12=Lenski|first12=RE|last13=Mackay|first13=TFC|last14=Schluter|first14=D|last15=Strassmann|first15=JE|title=Does evolutionary theory need a rethink?|journal=Nature|date=2014|volume=514|pages=161-164|bibcode=2014Natur.514..161L|doi=10.1038/514161a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern is that the proximate-ultimate distinction has discouraged consideration of the manner in which developmental processes can set the evolutionary agenda, for instance, by introducing innovations, channeling phenotypic variation, or initiating evolutionary episodes through modifying selection pressures. One the other side are researchers who largely adopt Mayr’s stance with a clean separation of proximate and ultimate causation. For the latter, a failure to respect Mayr’s dichotomy is considered a sign of confusing an evolutionary explanation with a mechanistic explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawkins|first1=R|title=Extended phenotype—but not too extended.

'''Revolving rivers''' are a surprising, uncommon way of [[sand]] pile growth that can be found in a few sands around the world, but has been studied in detail only for one [[Cuba]]n sand from a place called Santa Teresa ([[Pinar del Rio]] province).

==Description==

When pouring "revolving" sand on a flat surface from a fixed position, the growth of a conical pile does not occur by the common [[avalanche]] mechanism, where sand slides down the pile in a more or less random fashion. What happens in that a relatively thin "river" of flowing sand travels from the pouring point at the apex of the pile to its base, while the rest of the sand at the surface is static. In addition, the river "revolves" around the pile either in clockwise or counter-clockwise directions (looking from top) depending on the initial conditions of the experiment. Actually the river constitutes the "cutting edge" of a layer of sand that deposits as a helix on the conical pile, and makes it grow.
For small sandpiles, rivers are continuous, but they become intermittent
for larger piles.

== History and state of the art ==

The phenomenon was observed first by E. Altshuler at the [[University of Havana]] in 1995, but at the time he assumed that it was well known, and temporarily forgot about it. In 2000, being at the [[University of Houston]], he told K. E. Bassler, who showed a vivid interest in the matter. Embarrassingly enough, Altshuler was unable to demonstrate it before Bassler using a random sand from Houston, so he had to send him a video from [[Cuba]] after his return to the island.

Once the existence of the strange phenomenon was confirmed for everyone, E. Altshuler and a number of collaborators performed a systematic study in [[Havana]], which was then jointly published with Bassler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=
Sandpile formation by revolving rivers|journal=Physical Review Letters| date=2003 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.014501|pmid=12906542|bibcode=2003PhRvL..91a4501A|volume=91|issue=1|pages=014501|arxiv=cond-mat/0206493}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work has been done to understand in more detail the
phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=
Revolving rivers in sandpiles: from continuous to intermittent flows|journal=Physical Review E|date=2008 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.77.031305|volume=77|issue=3 Pt 1|pmid=18517368|page=031305|arxiv=0711.0920|bibcode=2008PhRvE..77c1305A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kong, X.-Z.|display-authors=etal|title=Kinetic energy sandpile model for conical sandpile development by revolving rivers
|journal=Physics Letters A|date=2006 |
url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037596010501337X|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2005.08.068|volume=348|issue=3–6|pages=77–81|bibcode=2006PhLA..348...77K}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been found in other sands from different parts of the world. 
However, the connection between the physical, chemical (and possibly biological) properties of the grains in a specific sand, the nature of the inter-grain interactions, and the emergence of the revolving rivers is still an open question.

Sand from Santa Teresa is made of almost pure [[silicon dioxide]] grains with an average [[grain size]] of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm approximately and no visible special features regarding grain shape. But in spite of its apparent simplicity, many puzzles still remain. For example, after many experiments one batch of sand may stop showing revolving rivers (just as [[singing sand]] eventually stops singing), which suggests that the decay is connected to certain properties of the surface of the grains that degrade by continued friction.

Videos of the effect are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=YouTubeRiosEng| author=Complexperiments |date=2010 |

'''Simmonsite''' is a halide mineral, being a tertiary light metal fluoride, with formula [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[lithium|Li]][[aluminum|Al]][[fluorine|F]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. It was first discovered in nature in Mineral County in the Gillis Range of [[Nevada]], U.S.A. The mineral is found intergrown with [[cryolite]], cryolithionite and trace elpasolite. The mineral has a [[monoclinic]] structure of P2 or P2/m. The ideal chemical formula for simmonsite is [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[lithium|Li]][[aluminum|Al]][[fluorine|F]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The mineral has a no visible cleavage, Mohs hardness of 2.53, a pale white color with a white streak and feels somewhat greasy. Simmonsite was named for the Professor of Mineralogy and Petrology at the [[University of New Orleans]], William B. Simmons.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

==Occurrence==
Simmonsite, cryolite and cryolithionite form together as part of the alumino-fluoride aassemblage in a late stage [[breccia]] pipe structure that cross the Zapot amazonite-topaz-zinnwaldite pegmatite located in the described location above in Nevada.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt; This assemblage occurs with around a third of each of theses phases. The three phases form an intergrowth of anhedral to subhedral grains that can be micrometers to approximately two or three hundred micrometers in size. The main anhydrous alumino-fluorides results in size almost 20cm or more across and weight more than 1kg. &lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;Another assemblage of alumino-fluorides exist, some that contain water or hydroxyl, pachnolite, weberite, thomsenollite, prosopite, ralstonite, as well as a second generation of cryolithionite.

==Physical properties==
Simmonsite contains no observable euhedral crystals but it does have complex polysynthetic twinning. Its color is pale buff to cream in the hadn specimens accompanied by a white streak and has a greasy appearance. It exhibits a hardness of 2.5-3 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]]. There is no apparent cleavage, a subconchoidal fracture, no parting, and is not brittle. The measured density is 3.05(2) g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

==Optical properties==
The optical properties of this mineral were discovered by using the standard optical spindle stage procedure in 589 nm light. It was determined to have [[birefringence]] with a Berek compensator. &lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Simmonsite is a fairly simple mineral chemically as the only elements present in major or minor amounts are Na, Al, Li, and F.  The empirical chemical formula for simmonsite is [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[lithium|Li]][[aluminum|Al]][[fluorine|F]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The four primary alumino-fluorides behave distinctly different under an electron beam with elpasolite and cryolithionite showing no beam damage with time, even though simmonsite did have some and cryolite having the greatest extent of damage.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

==X-ray crystallography==
Natural simmonsite is monoclinic with P2 or P2/m. The unit cell dimensions are a=7.5006(6) Å, b= 7.474(1) Å, c= 7.503(1) Å, β = 90.847(9)°, V= 420.6(1) Å3, Z= 4. These dimensions are almost identical to those of babingtonite. Simmonsite has had a long history of it being difficult to understand as there have been previous studies trying to understand the [[crystallography]]. Errors were discovered in previous work by Holm and Holm(1970) that suggested it was monoclinic, B-centered, a=7.54 Å, b= 7.52 Å, c= 7.53 Å, β = 90.81°.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

'''Sociological naturalism''' is a theory that states that the [[Nature|natural world]] and [[society|social world]] are roughly identical and governed by similar principles. Sociological naturalism, in sociological texts simply referred to as '''naturalism''', can be traced back to the philosophical thinking of [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century, closely connected to [[positivism]], which advocates use of the [[scientific method]] of the [[natural science]]s in studying [[social science]]s. It should not be identified too closely with Positivism, however, since whilst the latter advocates the use of controlled situations like experiments as sources of scientific information, naturalism insists that social processes should only be studied in their ''natural'' setting.  A similar form of naturalism was applied to the scientific study of art and literature by [[Hippolyte Taine]] (see [[Race, milieu, and moment]]).

Contemporary sociologists do not generally dispute that social phenomena take place within the natural universe and, as such, are subject to natural constraints, such as the laws of physics.  Up for debate is the nature of the distinctiveness of social phenomena as a subset of natural phenomena. Broad support exists for the antipositivist claim that crucial qualitative differences mean that one cannot explain social phenomena effectively using investigative tools or even standards of validity derived from other natural sciences. From this point of view, naturalism does not imply [[scientism]].  

However, a classically positivist conflation of naturalism with scientism has not disappeared; this view is still dominant in some old and prestigious schools, such as the sociology departments at the University of Chicago in the United States, and McGill University in Montréal, Canada.

More recently, [[actor-network theory]] has analyzed the social construction of the nature/society distinction itself.

'''Software evolution''' is the term used in [[software engineering]] (specifically [[software maintenance]]) to refer to the process of developing [[software]] initially, then repeatedly updating it for various reasons. 

==General introduction==
[[Fred Brooks]], in his key book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Brooks]], ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''. [[Addison-Wesley]], 1975 &amp; 1995. ISBN
0-201-00650-2 &amp; {{ISBN|0-201-83595-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states that over 90% of the costs of a typical system arise in the maintenance phase, and that any successful piece of software will inevitably be maintained.

In fact, [[Agile methods]] stem from maintenance-like activities in and around web based technologies, where the bulk of the capability comes from frameworks and standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Software maintenance address bug fixes and minor enhancements and software evolution focus on [[Adaptation (computer science)|adaptation]] and [[System migration|migration]].

&lt;!-- evolution of evolution models --&gt;
Software technologies will continue to develop. These changes will require new laws and theories to be created and justified. Some models as well would require additional aspects in developing future programs. Innovations and improvements do increase unexpected form of software development. The maintenance issues also would probably change as to adapt to the evolution of the future software. Software processes are themselves evolving, after going through learning and refinements, it is always improve their efficiency and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;aeddy; ref: Understanding Open Source Software Evolution Walt Scacchi Institute for Software Research&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
The need for software evolution comes from the fact that no one is able to predict how user requirements will evolve ''a priori'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1=K. H. | last1=Bennett | first2=V. T. | last2=Rajlich | first3=R. Mohamad | last3=Mazrul, | title = Legacy System: Coping with success | journal=[[IEEE Software]] | date=1995 | pages=19–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other words, the existing systems are never complete and continue to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | author = Trung Hung Vo | title = Software Maintenance| date=  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they evolve, the complexity of the systems will grow unless there is a better solution available to solve these issues. The main objectives of software evolution are ensuring functional relevance, reliability and flexibility of the system. Software evolution can be fully manual (based on changes by software engineers), partially automated (e.g. using refactoring tools) or fully automated (with autonomous configuration or evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baudry|first=Benoit|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Mony|first3=Cendrine|last4=Chauvel|first4=Franck|last5=Fleurey|first5=Franck|last6=Clarke|first6=Siobhan|date=February 2014|title=DIVERSIFY: Ecology-inspired software evolution for diversity emergence|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6747203/?reload=true|journal=2014 Software Evolution Week - IEEE Conference on Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Reverse Engineering (CSMR-WCRE)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/csmr-wcre.2014.6747203|isbn=9781479937523|citeseerx=10.1.1.646.2786}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Software evolution has been greatly impacted by the Internet:

* the rapid growth of World Wide Web and Internet Resources make it easier for users and engineers to find related information. 

* open source development where anybody could download the source codes and hence modify it has enabled fast and parallel evolution (through forks). 

==Types of software maintenance==

E.B. Swanson initially identified the 
three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective. Four categories of software were then catalogued by Lientz and Swanson (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Lientz, B.P. and Swanson, E.B., ''Software Maintenance Management, A Study Of The Maintenance Of Computer Application Software In 487 Data Processing Organizations''. Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1980. {{ISBN|0-201-04205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These have since been updated and normalized internationally in the [[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006:&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Corrective maintenance'': Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems;
* ''Adaptive maintenance'': Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment;
* ''Perfective maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability;
* ''Preventive maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

All of the preceding take place when there is a known requirement for change.

Although these categories were supplemented by many authors like Warren et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

==Stage model==
Current trends  and practices are projected forward using a new model of software evolution called the staged model [1]. Staged model was introduced to replace conventional analysis which is less suitable for modern software development is rapid changing due to its difficulties of hard to contribute in software evolution. There are five distinct stages contribute in simple staged model (Initial development, Evolution, Servicing, Phase-out, and Close-down). 
* According to K.H.Bennett and V.T Rajlich [1], the key contribution is to separate the 'maintenance' phase into an evolution stage followed by a servicing and phase out stages. The first version of software system which is lacking some features will be developed during initial development or also known as alpha stage [2]. However, the architecture has already been possessed during this stage will bring for any future changes or amendments. Most references in this stage will base on scenarios or case study. Knowledge has defined as another important outcome of initial development. Such knowledge including the knowledge of application domain, user requirements, business rules, policies, solutions, algorithm, etc. Knowledge also seems as the important factor for the subsequent phase of evolution.
* Once the previous stage completed successfully (and must be completed successfully before entering next stage), the next stage would be evolution. Users tend to change their requirements as well as they prefer to see some improvements or changes. Due to this factor, the software industry is facing the challenges of rapid changes environment. Hence the goal of evolution is to adapt the application to the ever-changing user requirements and operating environment [1]. During the previous stage, the first version application created might contain a lot of faults, and those faults will be fixed during evolution stage based on more specified and accurate requirements due to the case study or scenarios.
* The software will continuously evolve until it is no longer evolvable and then enter stage of servicing (also known as software maturity). During this stage, only minor changes will be done.
* Next stage which is phase-out, there is no more servicing available for that particular software. However, the software still in production.
* Lastly, close-down. The software use is disconnected or discontinue [2] and the users are directed towards a replacement.[1].

==Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution==
{{Main|Lehman's laws of software evolution}}
Prof. [[Meir M. Lehman]], who worked at [[Imperial College London]] from 1972 to 2002, and his colleagues have identified a set of behaviours in the evolution of proprietary software. These behaviours (or observations) are known as Lehman's Laws, and there are eight of them:

# (1974) "Continuing Change" — an E-type system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory&lt;ref name="laws1-5"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(79)90022-0|last=Lehman|first=M. M.|title=On Understanding Laws, Evolution, and Conservation in the Large-Program Life Cycle|year=1980|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=1|pages=213–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# (1974) "Increasing Complexity" — as an E-type system evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1980) "Self Regulation" — E-type system evolution processes are self-regulating with the distribution of product and process measures close to normal&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Organisational Stability ([[invariant work rate]])" - the average effective global activity rate in an evolving E-type system is invariant over the product's lifetime&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Familiarity" — as an E-type system evolves, all associated with it, developers, sales personnel and users, for example, must maintain mastery of its content and behaviour to achieve satisfactory evolution. Excessive growth diminishes that mastery. Hence the average [[incremental growth]] remains invariant as the system evolves.&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1991) "Continuing Growth" — the functional content of an E-type system must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime
# (1996) "Declining Quality" — the quality of an E-type system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes
# (1996) "Feedback System" (first stated 1974, formalised as law 1996) — E-type evolution processes constitute multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems and must be treated as such to achieve significant improvement over any reasonable base&lt;ref&gt;[[Lehman's laws of software evolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth mentioning that the applicability of all of these laws for all types of software systems has been studied by several researchers. For example, see a presentation by Nanjangud C Narendra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Software-Evolution-in-Agile-Development | title=Software Evolution in Agile Development | first=Nanjangud | last=Narendra | website=InfoQ | date=29 April 2011 | accessdate=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes a case study of an enterprise Agile project in the light of Lehman’s laws of software evolution. Some empirical observations coming from the study of [[open source software development]] appear to challenge some of the laws {{Vague|date=June 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The laws predict that the need for functional change in a software system is inevitable, and not a consequence of incomplete or incorrect analysis of requirements or bad programming. They state that there are limits to what a software development team can achieve in terms of safely implementing changes and new functionality.

Maturity Models specific to software evolution have been developed to improve processes, and help to ensure continuous rejuvenation of the software as it evolves iteratively{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

The "global process" that is made by the many stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, their managers) has many feedback loops. The evolution speed is a function of the feedback loop structure and other characteristics of the global system. Process simulation techniques, such as [[system dynamics]] can be useful in understanding and managing such global process.

Software evolution is not likely to be [[Darwinian evolution|Darwinian]], [[Lamarckian evolution|Lamarckian]] or [[Baldwinian evolution|Baldwinian]], but an important phenomenon on its own. Given the increasing dependence on software at all levels of society and economy, the successful evolution of software is becoming increasingly critical. This is an important topic of research that hasn't received much attention.

The evolution of software, because of its rapid path in comparison to other man-made entities, was seen by Lehman as the "fruit fly" of the study of the evolution of artificial systems.

'''Soil''' is a [[mixture]] of [[organic matter]], [[minerals]], [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s, and [[organism]]s that together support [[life]]. [[Earth]]'s body of soil is the [[pedosphere]], which has four important functions: it is a medium for plant growth; it is a means of [[water storage]], supply and purification; it is a modifier of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]; it is a habitat for organisms; all of which, in turn, modify the soil.

The pedosphere interfaces with the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesworth |first=Ward |date=2008 |title=Encyclopedia of soil science |isbn=978-1402039942 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands |nopp=true |url=http://data.lib.hutech.edu.vn/mucluc/f2e0a00788a82be82718e64d734d1a50.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pedolith'', used commonly to refer to the soil, translates to ''ground stone''.

Soil is a major component of the [[Earth]]'s [[ecosystem]]. The world's ecosystems are impacted in far-reaching ways by the processes carried out in the soil, from [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]] to [[rainforest destruction]] and [[water pollution]]. With respect to Earth's [[carbon cycle]], soil is an important [[carbon sink|carbon reservoir]], and it is potentially one of the most reactive to human disturbance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pouyat |first1=Richard |last2=Groffman |first2=Peter |last3=Yesilonis |first3=Ian |last4=Hernandez |first4=Luis |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Environmental Pollution (journal)|Environmental Pollution]] |volume=116 |issue=Supplement 1 |title=Soil carbon pools and fluxes in urban ecosystems |url=https://www.ncrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2002/ne_2002_Pouyat_001.pdf |year=2002 |pages=S107–S118 |doi=10.1016/S0269-7491(01)00263-9 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and climate change.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davidson |first1=Eric A. |last2=Janssens |first2=Ivan A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=440 |title=Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7253750 |year=2006 |issue=9 March 2006 |pages=165‒73 |doi=10.1038/nature04514 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |pmid=16525463|bibcode=2006Natur.440..165D }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the planet warms, it has been predicted that soils will add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere due to increased [[Soil biology|biological]] activity at higher temperatures, a [[positive feedback]] (amplification).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Powlson |first=David |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=433 |title=Climatology: will soil amplify climate change? |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/433204a.pdf |year=2005 |issue=20 January 2005 |pages=204‒05 |doi=10.1038/433204a |pmid=15662396 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2005Natur.433..204P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction has, however, been questioned on consideration of more recent knowledge on soil carbon turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bradford |first1=Mark A. |last2=Wieder |first2=William R. |last3=Bonan |first3=Gordon B. |last4=Fierer |first4=Noah |last5=Raymond |first5=Peter A. |last6=Crowther |first6=Thomas W. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Nature Climate Change]] |volume=6 |title=Managing uncertainty in soil carbon feedbacks to climate change |url=http://fiererlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bradford_etal_2016_NCC.pdf |year=2016 |issue=27 July 2016 |pages=751–58 |doi=10.1038/nclimate3071 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2016NatCC...6..751B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil acts as an engineering medium, a habitat for [[soil organisms]], a recycling system for [[nutrients]] and [[organic waste]]s, a regulator of [[water quality]], a modifier of [[Atmospheric chemistry|atmospheric composition]], and a medium for [[plant growth]], making it a critically important provider of [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dominati |first1=Estelle |last2=Patterson |first2=Murray |last3=Mackay |first3=Alec |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |volume=69 |issue=9 |title=A framework for classifying and quantifying the natural capital and ecosystem services of soils |year=2010 |url=http://esanalysis.colmex.mx/Sorted%20Papers/2010/2010%20NZL%20-3F%20Phys.pdf |pages=1858‒68 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.05.002 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since soil has a tremendous range of available niches and habitats, it contains most of the Earth's genetic diversity.

A typical soil is about 50% solids (45% mineral and 5% organic matter), and 50% voids (or pores) of which half is occupied by water and half by gas.&lt;ref name="McClellan2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=McClellan |first=Tai |title=Soil composition |url=https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/mauisoil/a_comp.aspx |publisher=University of Hawai‘i – College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percent soil mineral and organic content can be treated as a constant (in the short term), while the percent soil water and gas content is considered highly variable whereby a rise in one is simultaneously balanced by a reduction in the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arizona Master Gardener Manual |url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/soils/soils.html |publisher=Cooperative Extension, College of Agriculture, University of Arizona |accessdate=17 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529015259/http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/soils/soils.html |archivedate=29 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pore space allows for the infiltration and movement of air and water, both of which are critical for life existing in soil.&lt;ref name="Vannier1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vannier |first=Guy |journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils |volume=3 |issue=1 |title=The porosphere as an ecological medium emphasized in Professor Ghilarov's work on soil animal adaptations |year=1987 |url=https://eurekamag.com/pdf/001/001713676.pdf |pages=39–44 |doi=10.1007/BF00260577 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compaction, a common problem with soils, reduces this space, preventing air and water from reaching plant roots and soil organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torbert |first1=H.

Given sufficient time, an undifferentiated soil will evolve a [[soil horizon|soil profile]] which consists of two or more layers, referred to as [[soil horizon]]s, that differ in one or more properties such as in their texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, color, and reactivity.&lt;ref name="Buol"/&gt; The horizons differ greatly in thickness and generally lack sharp boundaries; their development is dependent on the type of [[parent material]], the processes that modify those parent materials, and the [[Soil#soil-forming factors|soil-forming factors]] that influence those processes. The biological influences on soil properties are strongest near the surface, while the geochemical influences on soil properties increase with depth. Mature soil profiles typically include three basic master horizons: A, B, and C. The [[solum]] normally includes the A and B horizons. The living component of the soil is largely confined to the solum, and is generally more prominent in the A horizon.{{sfn|Simonson|1957|p=17}}

The [[soil texture]] is determined by the relative proportions of the individual particles of sand, silt, and clay that make up the soil. The interaction of the individual mineral particles with organic matter, water, gases via [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] processes causes those particles to [[flocculate]] (stick together) to form [[soil structure|aggregates]] or [[ped]]s.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bronick |first1=Carol J. |last2=Lal |first2=Ratan |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil structure and management: a review |journal=Geoderma |date=January 2005 |volume=124 |issue=1/2 |pages=3–22 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2004.03.005 |url=http://tinread.usarb.md:8888/tinread/fulltext/lal/soil_structure.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2005Geode.124....3B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where these aggregates can be identified, a soil can be said to be developed, and can be described further in terms of color, [[porosity]], [[consistency]], reaction ([[acidity]]), etc.

Water is a critical agent in soil development due to its involvement in the dissolution, precipitation, erosion, transport, and deposition of the materials of which a soil is composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |website=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of water and dissolved or suspended materials that occupy the soil [[pore space]] is called the soil solution. Since [[soil water]] is never pure water, but contains hundreds of dissolved organic and mineral substances, it may be more accurately called the soil solution. Water is central to the [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] and [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of minerals from the [[soil profile]]. Finally, water affects the type of vegetation that grows in a soil, which in turn affects the development of the soil, a complex feedback which is exemplified in the dynamics of banded vegetation patterns in semi-arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valentin |first1=Christian |last2=d'Herbès |first2=Jean-Marc |last3=Poesen |first3=Jean |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=37 |issue=1 |title=Soil and water components of banded vegetation patterns |year=1999 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248379223 |pages=1‒24 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00053-3 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soils supply plants with nutrients, most of which are held in place by particles of [[Soil texture#Soil separates|clay]] and [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] ([[colloid]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barber |first=Stanley A. |date=1995 |chapter=Chemistry of soil-nutrient associations |title=Soil nutrient bioavailability: a mechanistic approach |pages=9–48 |edition=2nd |editor-last=Barber |editor-first=Stanley A. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0471587477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nutrients may be [[Adsorption|adsorbed]] on clay mineral surfaces, bound within clay minerals ([[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]]), or bound within organic compounds as part of the living [[Soil organism|organisms]] or dead [[soil organic matter]]. These bound nutrients interact with soil water to buffer the soil solution composition (attenuate changes in the soil solution) as soils wet up or dry out, as plants take up nutrients, as salts are leached, or as acids or alkalis are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagri.org/eagri50/SSAC121/lec14.pdf |title=Soil colloids: properties, nature, types and significance |website=[[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soilminerals.com/Cation_Exchange_Simplified.htm |title=Cation exchange capacity in soils, simplified |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant nutrient availability is affected by [[soil pH]], which is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in the soil solution. Soil pH is a function of many soil forming factors, and is generally lower (more acid) where weathering is more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/18519/FS-1054%20Soil%20pH%20and%20Nutrient%20Availbility.pdf |last=Miller |first=Jarrod O. |title=Soil pH affects nutrient availability |website=[[University of Maryland]] |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most plant nutrients, with the exception of nitrogen, originate from the [[mineral]]s that make up the soil parent material. Some nitrogen originates from rain as dilute [[nitric acid]] and [[ammonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goulding |first1=Keith W.T. |last2=Bailey |first2=Neal J. |last3=Bradbury |first3=Nicola J. |last4=Hargreaves |first4=Patrick |last5=Howe |first5=MT |last6=Murphy |first6=Daniel V. |last7=Poulton |first7=Paul R. |last8=Willison |first8=Toby W. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=139 |issue=1 |title=Nitrogen deposition and its contribution to nitrogen cycling and associated soil processes |year=1998 |pages=49‒58 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00182.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the nitrogen is available in soils as a result of [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. Once in the soil-plant system, most nutrients are recycled through living organisms, plant and microbial residues ([[soil organic matter]]), mineral-bound forms, and the soil solution. Both living [[Soil microbe|microorganisms]] and [[soil organic matter]] are of critical importance to this recycling, and thereby to soil formation and soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kononova |first=M.

==History of studies==

===Fertility===
The history of the study of soil is intimately tied to humans' urgent need to provide food for themselves and forage for our animals. Throughout history, civilizations have prospered or declined as a function of the availability and productivity of their soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hillel |first=Daniel |date=1993 |title=Out of the Earth: civilization and the life of the soil |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0520080805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek historian [[Xenophon]] (450–355 BCE) is credited with being the first to expound upon the merits of green-manuring crops: "But then whatever weeds are upon the ground, being turned into earth, enrich the soil as much as dung."{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}

[[Columella]]'s "Husbandry," circa 60 CE, advocated the use of lime and that [[clover]] and [[alfalfa]] ([[green manure]]) should be turned under, and was used by 15 generations (450 years) under the [[Roman Empire]] until its collapse.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=1}} From the [[fall of Rome]] to the [[French Revolution]], knowledge of soil and agriculture was passed on from parent to child and as a result, crop yields were low.

Experiments into what made plants grow first led to the idea that the ash left behind when plant matter was burned was the essential element but overlooked the role of nitrogen, which is not left on the ground after combustion, a belief which prevailed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Ploeg |first1=Rienk R. |last2=Schweigert |first2=Peter |last3=Bachmann |first3=Joerg |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Scientific World Journal]] |volume=1 |issue=S2 |title=Use and misuse of nitrogen in agriculture: the German story |url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2001/683180/abs/ |year=2001 |pages=737–44 |doi=10.1100/tsw.2001.263 |pmid=12805882 |pmc=6084271 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1635, the Flemish chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] thought he had proved water to be the essential element from his famous five years' experiment with a willow tree grown with only the addition of rainwater. His conclusion came from the fact that the increase in the plant's weight had apparently been produced only by the addition of water, with no reduction in the soil's weight.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=3}} [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] (d. 1728) experimented with various types of water ranging from clean to muddy and found muddy water the best, and so he concluded that earthy matter was the essential element. Others concluded it was humus in the soil that passed some essence to the growing plant. Still others held that the vital growth principal was something passed from dead plants or animals to the new plants. At the start of the 18th century, [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] demonstrated that it was beneficial to cultivate (stir) the soil, but his opinion that the stirring made the fine parts of soil available for plant absorption was erroneous.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Nyle C. |title=The nature and properties of soils |edition=9th |year=1984 |publisher=[[Collier Macmillan]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0023133404}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=2}}

As chemistry developed, it was applied to the investigation of [[soil fertility]]. The French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] showed in about 1778 that plants and animals must [combust] oxygen internally to live and was able to deduce that most of the 165-pound weight of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|van Helmont]]'s willow tree derived from air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |language=fr |last=de Lavoisier |first=Antoine-Laurent |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |title=Mémoire sur la combustion en général |year=1777 |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Franklin/Franklin_pdf/Mem1777_p592.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the French agriculturalist [[Jean-Baptiste Boussingault]] who by means of experimentation obtained evidence showing that the main sources of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for plants were air and water, while nitrogen was taken from soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=fr |last=Boussingault |first=Jean-Baptiste |title=Agronomie, chimie agricole et physiologie, volumes 1-5 |year=1860–1874 |publisher=Mallet-Bachelier |location=Paris, France |url=https://archive.org/details/8TSUP364_1 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justus von Liebig]] in his book ''Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology'' (published 1840), asserted that the chemicals in plants must have come from the soil and air and that to maintain soil fertility, the used minerals must be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Liebig |first=Justus |title=Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology |year=1840 |publisher=Taylor and Walton |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00liebrich |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig nevertheless believed the nitrogen was supplied from the air. The enrichment of soil with guano by the Incas was rediscovered in 1802, by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. This led to its mining and that of Chilean nitrate and to its application to soil in the United States and Europe after 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J. Thomas |journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England |title=On the composition and money value of the different varieties of guano |year=1849 |volume=10 |pages=196–230 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/37078#page/220/mode/1up |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Liebig was a revolution for agriculture, and so other investigators started experimentation based on it. In England [[John Bennet Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] worked in the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]], founded by the former, and (re)discovered that plants took nitrogen from the soil, and that salts needed to be in an available state to be absorbed by plants. Their investigations also produced the "[[superphosphate]]", consisting in the acid treatment of phosphate rock.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}} This led to the invention and use of salts of potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) as fertilizers. Ammonia generated by the production of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] was recovered and used as fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tandon |first=Hari L.S. |url=http://www.tandontech.net/fertilisers.html |title=A short history of fertilisers |website=Fertiliser Development and Consultation Organisation |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the chemical basis of nutrients delivered to the soil in manure was understood and in the mid-19th century chemical fertilisers were applied. However, the dynamic interaction of soil and its life forms still awaited discovery.

In 1856 J. Thomas Way discovered that ammonia contained in fertilisers was transformed into nitrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J. Thomas |journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England |title=On the power of soils to absorb manure |year=1852 |volume=13 |pages=123–43 |url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/45583402 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twenty years later [[Robert Warington]] proved that this transformation was done by living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warington |first=Robert |title=Note on the appearance of nitrous acid during the evaporation of water: a report of experiments made in the Rothamsted laboratory |year=1878 |publisher=[[Harrison and Sons]] |location=London, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 [[Sergei Winogradsky]] announced he had found the bacteria responsible for this transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |language=fr |last=Winogradsky |first=Sergei |journal=[[Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences]] |title=Sur les organismes de la nitrification |year=1890 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=1013–16 |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30663/f1087 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was known that certain [[legume]]s could take up nitrogen from the air and fix it to the soil but it took the development of bacteriology towards the end of the 19th century to lead to an understanding of the role played in [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. The symbiosis of bacteria and leguminous roots, and the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria, were simultaneously discovered by the German agronomist [[Hermann Hellriegel]] and the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]].{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}}

[[Crop rotation]], mechanisation, chemical and natural fertilisers led to a doubling of wheat yields in western Europe between 1800 and 1900.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|pp=1–4}}

===Formation===
The scientists who studied the soil in connection with agricultural practices had considered it mainly as a static substrate. However, soil is the result of evolution from more ancient geological materials, under the action of [[Life|biotic]] and abiotic (not associated with life) processes. After studies of the improvement of the soil commenced, others began to study soil genesis and as a result also soil types and classifications.

In 1860, in Mississippi, [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] studied the relationship among rock material, climate, and vegetation, and the type of soils that were developed. He realised that the soils were dynamic, and considered soil types classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hilgard |first=Eugene W. |title=Soils: their formation, properties, composition, and relations to climate and plant growth in the humid and arid regions |year=1921 |publisher=[[The Macmillan Company]] |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/65783 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately his work was not continued. At the same time [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] (about 1870) was leading a team of soil scientists in Russia who conducted an extensive survey of soils, finding that similar basic rocks, climate and vegetation types lead to similar soil layering and types, and established the concepts for soil classifications. Due to language barriers, the work of this team was not communicated to western Europe until 1914 through a publication in German by [[Konstantin Glinka|Konstantin Dmitrievich Glinka]], a member of the Russian team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=ge |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=Die Typen der Bodenbildung: ihre Klassifikation und geographische Verbreitung |year=1914 |publisher=[[Borntraeger]] |location=Berlin, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Curtis F. Marbut]] was influenced by the work of the Russian team, translated Glinka's publication into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=The great soil groups of the world and their development |year=1927 |publisher=Edwards Brothers |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as he was placed in charge of the U. S. [[National Cooperative Soil Survey]], applied it to a national soil classification system.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;

==Formation==
Soil formation, or [[pedogenesis]], is the combined effect of physical, chemical, biological and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] processes working on soil parent material. Soil is said to be formed when organic matter has accumulated and [[colloid]]s are washed downward, leaving deposits of clay, humus, iron oxide, carbonate, and gypsum, producing a distinct layer called the B horizon. This is a somewhat arbitrary definition as mixtures of sand, silt, clay and humus will support biological and agricultural activity before that time. These constituents are moved from one level to another by water and animal activity. As a result, layers (horizons) form in the soil profile. The alteration and movement of materials within a soil causes the formation of distinctive [[soil horizons]]. However, more recent definitions of soil embrace soils without any organic matter, such as those [[regolith]]s that formed on Mars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bishop |first1=Janice L. |last2=Murchie |first2=Scott L. |last3=Pieters |first3=Carlé L. |last4=Zent |first4=Aaron P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2002 |title=A model for formation of dust, soil, and rock coatings on Mars: physical and chemical processes on the Martian surface |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=107 |issue=E11 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1029/2001JE001581 |bibcode=2002JGRE..107.5097B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and analogous conditions in planet Earth deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Navarro-González |first1=Rafael |last2=Rainey |first2=Fred A. |last3=Molina |first3=Paola |last4=Bagaley |first4=Danielle R. |last5=Hollen |first5=Becky J. |last6=de la Rosa |first6=José |last7=Small |first7=Alanna M. |last8=Quinn |first8=Richard C. |last9=Grunthaner |first9=Frank J. |last10=Cáceres |first10=Luis |last11=Gomez-Silva |first11=Benito |last12=McKay |first12=Christopher P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2003 |title=Mars-like soils in the Atacama desert, Chile, and the dry limit of microbial life |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=302 |issue=5647 |pages=1018–21 |doi=10.1126/science.1089143 |pmid=14605363 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9020258 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1018N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the development of a soil would begin with the weathering of lava flow bedrock, which would produce the purely mineral-based parent material from which the soil texture forms. Soil development would proceed most rapidly from bare rock of recent flows in a warm climate, under heavy and frequent rainfall. Under such conditions, plants (in a first stage [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[lichens]] and [[cyanobacteria]] then [[epilithic]] [[higher plants]]) become established very quickly on [[basalt]]ic lava, even though there is very little organic material. The plants are supported by the porous rock as it is filled with [[nutrient]]-bearing water that carries minerals dissolved from the rocks. Crevasses and pockets, local topography of the rocks, would hold fine materials and harbour plant roots. The developing plant roots are associated with mineral-[[weathering]] [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]]&lt;ref name="Van Schöll2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Schöll |first1=Laura |last2=Smits |first2=Mark M. |last3=Hoffland |first3=Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2006 |title=Ectomycorrhizal weathering of the soil minerals muscovite and hornblende |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=805–14 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01790.x |pmid=16918551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that assist in breaking up the porous lava, and by these means organic matter and a finer mineral soil accumulate with time.

===Factors===

How soil formation proceeds is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil. They are: parent material, climate, topography (relief), organisms, and time.&lt;ref name="Jenny1941"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenny |first=Hans |title=Factors of soil formation: a system of qunatitative pedology |year=1941 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, New York |url=http://netedu.xauat.edu.cn/sykc/hjx/content/ckzl/6/2.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When reordered to climate, relief, organisms, parent material, and time, they form the acronym CROPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthonlinemedia.com/ebooks/tpe_3e/title_page.html |title=The physical environment: an introduction to physical geography |first=Michael E. |last=Ritter |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parent material====
The mineral material from which a soil forms is called [[parent material]]. Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.

Typical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20–21}}
* [[Quartz]]: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Calcite]]: CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[File:Lössacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]
Parent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.

Residual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}

Most soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.
* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60–90 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.
* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.
* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.
* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].

Cumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.

=====Weathering=====
The [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable. Chemical decomposition is a function of mineral solubility, the rate of which doubles with each 10&amp;nbsp;°C rise in temperature, but is strongly dependent on water to effect chemical changes. Rocks that will decompose in a few years in tropical climates will remain unaltered for millennia in deserts.&lt;ref name="Gilluly1975"/&gt; Structural changes are the result of hydration, oxidation, and reduction. Chemical weathering mainly results from the excretion of [[organic acids]] and [[chelating]] compounds by bacteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uroz |first1=Stéphane |last2=Calvaruso |first2=Christophe |last3=Turpault |first3=Marie-Pierre |last4=Frey-Klett |first4=Pascale |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009 |title=Mineral weathering by bacteria: ecology, actors and mechanisms |journal=[[Trends in Microbiology]] |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=378–87 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X09001279 |subscription=yes |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2009.05.004 |pmid=19660952 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fungi,&lt;ref name="Landeweert2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landeweert |first1=Renske |last2=Hoffland |first2=Ellis |last3=Finlay |first3=Roger D. |last4=Kuyper |first4=Thom W. |last5=Van Breemen |first5=Nico |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Linking plants to rocks: ectomycorrhizal fungi mobilize nutrients from minerals |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=248–54 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470102122X |subscription=yes |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02122-X |pmid=11301154 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought to increase under present-day [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Jeffrey A. |last2=Schlesinger |first2=William H. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Soil CO2 dynamics, acidification, and chemical weathering in a temperate forest with experimental CO2 enrichment |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=149–62 |doi=10.1029/2000GB001278 |bibcode=2001GBioC..15..149A }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Physical disintegration''' is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil. Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of "shells". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying, thereby stressing the rock. Finally, organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=28–31}} Grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Clive G. |last2=Shachak |first2=Moshe |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990 |title=Fertilization of the desert soil by rock-eating snails |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=346 |issue=6287 |pages=839–41 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242874418 |doi=10.1038/346839a0 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=1990Natur.346..839J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saprolite]] is a particular example of a residual soil formed from the transformation of granite, metamorphic and other types of bedrock into clay minerals. Often called [weathered granite], saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include: [[hydrolysis]], [[chelation]] from organic compounds, [[hydration reaction|hydration]] (the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs) and physical processes that include [[freezing]] and [[thawing]]. The mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary [[bedrock]] material, its physical features, including grain size and degree of consolidation, and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral. The texture, pH and mineral constituents of saprolite are inherited from its parent material. This process is also called ''arenization'', resulting in the formation of sandy soils (granitic arenas), thanks to the much higher resistance of quartz compared to other mineral components of granite ([[micas]],  [[amphiboles]], [[feldspars]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sequeira Braga |first1=Maria Amália |last2=Paquet |first2=Hélène |last3=Begonha |first3=Arlindo |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Weathering of granites in a temperate climate (NW Portugal): granitic saprolites and arenization |journal=Catena |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |pages=41–56 |url=http://home.uevora.pt/~lopes/Artigos/23.PDF |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(02)00017-6 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate====
The principal climatic variables influencing soil formation are effective [[precipitation]] (i.e., precipitation minus [[evapotranspiration]]) and temperature, both of which affect the rates of chemical, physical, and biological processes. Temperature and moisture both influence the organic matter content of soil through their effects on the balance between [[primary production]] and [[decomposition]]: the colder or drier the climate the lesser atmospheric carbon is fixed as organic matter while the lesser organic matter is decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epstein |first1=Howard E. |last2=Burke |first2=Ingrid C. |last3=Lauenroth |first3=William K. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Regional patterns of decomposition and primary production rates in the U.S. Great Plains |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=320–27 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233379719 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0320:RPODAP]2.0.CO;2 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate is the dominant factor in [[soil formation]], and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the [[climate zone]]s in which they form, with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt; If warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time, the processes of [[weathering]], [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], and plant growth will be maximized. According to the climatic determination of [[biomes]], humid climates favor the growth of trees. In contrast, grasses are the dominant native vegetation in subhumid and [[semiarid]] regions, while shrubs and brush of various kinds dominate in arid areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodward |first1=F.

Water is essential for all the major chemical weathering reactions. To be effective in soil formation, water must penetrate the [[regolith]]. The seasonal rainfall distribution, evaporative losses, site [[topography]], and [[soil permeability]] interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation. The greater the depth of water penetration, the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development. Surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper layers ([[eluviation]]) to the lower layers ([[illuviation]]), including clay particles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fedoroff |first=Nicolas |year=1997 |title=Clay illuviation in Red Mediterranean soils |journal=Catena |volume=28 |issue=3/4 |pages=171–89 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816296000367 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(96)00036-7 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dissolved organic matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michalzik |first1=Beate |last2=Kalbitz |first2=Karsten |last3=Park |first3=Ji-Hyung |last4=Solinger |first4=Stephan |last5=Matzner |first5=Egbert |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Fluxes and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen: a synthesis for temperate forests |journal=Biogeochemistry |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=173–205 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226356840 |doi=10.1023/A:1006441620810 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters. Thus, percolating water stimulates weathering reactions and helps differentiate soil horizons.

Climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity, which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lucas |first=Yves |year=2001 |title=The role of plants in controlling rates and products of weathering: importance of biological pumping |journal=[[Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences]] |volume=29 |pages=135–63 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228608786 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.29.1.135 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2001AREPS..29..135L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Topography====
The [[topography]], or [[relief]], is characterized by the inclination ([[slope]]), [[elevation]], and orientation of the terrain. Topography determines the rate of precipitation or [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and rate of formation or erosion of the surface [[soil profile]]. The topographical setting may either hasten or retard the work of climatic forces.

Steep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by [[erosion]] and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence, little mineral deposition in lower profiles. In semiarid regions, the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover, so there is less plant contribution to soil formation. For all of these reasons, steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction. Therefore, soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow, poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby, more level sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Baoyuan |last2=Nearing |first2=Mark A. |last3=Risse |first3=L. Mark |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1994 |title=Slope gradient effects on soil loss for steep slopes |journal=Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1835–40 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270613706 |doi=10.13031/2013.28273 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[swales]] and depressions where runoff water tends to concentrate, the regolith is usually more deeply weathered and soil profile development is more advanced. However, in the lowest landscape positions, water may saturate the regolith to such a degree that drainage and aeration are restricted. Here, the weathering of some minerals and the decomposition of organic matter are retarded, while the loss of iron and manganese is accelerated. In such low-lying topography, special profile features characteristic of [[wetland]] soils may develop. Depressions allow the accumulation of water, minerals and organic matter and in the extreme, the resulting soils will be [[saline marsh]]es or [[peat bog]]s. Intermediate topography affords the best conditions for the formation of an agriculturally productive soil.

Soil is the most abundant [[ecosystem]] on Earth, but the vast majority of organisms in soil are [[microbes]], a great many of which have not been described.&lt;ref name="Gans2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gans |first1=Jason |last2=Wolinsky |first2=Murray |last3=Dunbar |first3=John |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=Computational improvements reveal great bacterial diversity and high metal toxicity in soil |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=309 |issue=5739 |pages=1387–90 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7637990 |doi=10.1126/science.1112665 |pmid=16123304 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2005Sci...309.1387G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dance |first=Amber |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |title=What lies beneath |year=2008 |volume=455 |issue=7214 |pages=724–25 |pmid=18843336 |doi=10.1038/455724a |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081008/pdf/455724a.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be a population limit of around one billion cells per gram of soil, but estimates of the number of species vary widely from 50,000 per gram to over a million per gram of soil.&lt;ref name="Gans2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roesch"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roesch |first1=Luiz F.W. |last2=Fulthorpe |first2=Roberta R. |last3=Riva |first3=Alberto |last4=Casella |first4=George |last5=Hadwin |first5=Alison K.M. |last6=Kent |first6=Angela D. |last7=Daroub |first7=Samira H. |last8=Camargo |first8=Flavio A.O. |last9=Farmerie |first9=William G. |last10=Triplett |first10=Eric W. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[The ISME Journal]] |title=Pyrosequencing enumerates and contrasts soil microbial diversity |year=2007 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=283–90 |pmc=2970868 |pmid=18043639 |doi=10.1038/ismej.2007.53|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5803531 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of organisms and species can vary widely according to soil type, location, and depth.&lt;ref name="nature2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roesch"/&gt;

The mineral components of soil are [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]], and their relative proportions determine a soil's texture. Properties that are influenced by soil texture include [[Pore space in soil|porosity]], [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]], [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], [[Shrink–swell capacity|shrink-swell rate]], [[Field capacity|water-holding capacity]], and susceptibility to [[erosion]]. In the illustrated USDA textural classification triangle, the only soil in which neither sand, silt nor clay predominates is called [[loam]]. While even pure sand, silt or clay may be considered a soil, from the perspective of conventional [[agriculture]] a loam soil with a small amount of organic material is considered "ideal", inasmuch as [[fertilizers]] or [[manure]] are currently used to mitigate nutrient losses due to [[crop yields]] in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haynes |first1=Richard J. |last2=Naidu |first2=Ravi |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems |volume=51 |issue=2 |title=Influence of lime, fertilizer and manure applications on soil organic matter content and soil physical conditions: a review |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225252692 |year=1998 |pages=123–37 |doi=10.1023/A:1009738307837 |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mineral constituents of a loam soil might be 40% sand, 40% silt and the balance 20% clay by weight.

Sand is the most stable of the mineral components of soil; it consists of rock fragments, primarily [[quartz]] particles, ranging in size from {{convert|2.0|to|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Silt ranges in size from {{convert|0.05|to|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Clay cannot be resolved by optical microscopes as its particles are {{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}} or less in diameter and a thickness of only 10 [[angstroms]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m).{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Flemming|1957|p=331}} In medium-textured soils, clay is often washed downward through the soil profile (a process called [[eluviation]]) and accumulates in the subsoil (a process called [[illuviation]]). There is no clear relationship between the size of soil mineral components and their mineralogical nature: sand and silt particles can be [[calcareous]] as well as [[siliceous]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/calcsand.html |title=Calcareous Sand |website=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while textural clay ({{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}) can be made of very fine quartz particles as well as of multi-layered secondary minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grim |first=Ralph E. |date=1953 |title=Clay mineralogy |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, NY |url=http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/bitstream/1/2037422/1/1334.pdf |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil mineral components belonging to a given textural class may thus share properties linked to their [[specific surface area]] (e.g. [[moisture retention]]) but not those linked to their chemical composition (e.g. [[cation exchange capacity]]).

Soil components larger than {{convert|2.0|mm|in|abbr=on}} are classed as rock and gravel and are removed before determining the percentages of the remaining components and the textural class of the soil, but are included in the name. For example, a sandy [[loam]] soil with 20% gravel would be called gravelly sandy loam.

When the organic component of a soil is substantial, the soil is called organic soil rather than mineral soil. A soil is called organic if:

# Mineral fraction is 0% clay and organic matter is 20% or more
# Mineral fraction is 0% to 50% clay and organic matter is between 20% and 30%
# Mineral fraction is 50% or more clay and organic matter 30% or more.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=53}}

Soil structure often gives clues to its texture, organic matter content, biological activity, past soil evolution, human use, and the chemical and mineralogical conditions under which the soil formed. While texture is defined by the mineral component of a soil and is an innate property of the soil that does not change with agricultural activities, soil structure can be improved or destroyed by the choice and timing of farming practices.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"/&gt;

Soil structural classes:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=55–56}}

# Types: '''Shape''' and arrangement of peds
## Platy: Peds are flattened one atop the other 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Found in the A-horizon of forest soils and lake sedimentation.
## Prismatic and Columnar: Prismlike peds are long in the vertical dimension, 10–100&amp;nbsp;mm wide. Prismatic peds have flat tops, columnar peds have rounded tops. Tend to form in the B-horizon in high sodium soil where clay has accumulated.
## Angular and subangular: Blocky peds are imperfect cubes, 5–50&amp;nbsp;mm, angular have sharp edges, subangular have rounded edges. Tend to form in the B-horizon where clay has accumulated and indicate poor water penetration.
## Granular and Crumb: Spheroid peds of polyhedrons, 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm, often found in the A-horizon in the presence of organic material. Crumb peds are more porous and are considered ideal.
# Classes: '''Size''' of peds whose ranges depend upon the above type
## Very fine or very thin: &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm platy and spherical; &lt;5&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &lt;10&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Fine or thin: 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm platy, and spherical; 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Medium: 2–5&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 20–50 prismlike.
## Coarse or thick: 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 20–50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 50–100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Very coarse or very thick: &gt;10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; &gt;50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &gt;100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
# Grades: Is a measure of the degree of '''development''' or cementation within the peds that results in their strength and stability.
## Weak: Weak cementation allows peds to fall apart into the three textural constituents, sand, silt and clay.
## Moderate: Peds are not distinct in undisturbed soil but when removed they break into aggregates, some broken aggregates and little unaggregated material. This is considered ideal.
## Strong:Peds are distinct before removed from the profile and do not break apart easily.
## Structureless: Soil is entirely cemented together in one great mass such as slabs of clay or no cementation at all such as with sand.

At the largest scale, the forces that shape a soil's structure result from [[Shrink–swell capacity|swelling and shrinkage]] that initially tend to act horizontally, causing vertically oriented prismatic peds. This mechanical process is mainly exemplified in the development of [[vertisols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinka |first1=Takele M. |last2=Morgan |first2=Cristine L.S. |last3=McInnes |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Kishné |first4= Andrea Sz. |last5=Harmel |first5=R.

===Consistency===
Consistency is the ability of soil to stick to itself or to other objects ([[Cohesion (geology)|cohesion]] and [[adhesion]], respectively) and its ability to resist deformation and rupture. It is of approximate use in predicting cultivation problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boekel |first1=P. |last2=Peerlkamp |first2=Petrus K. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Netherlands Journal of Agricultural Science |volume=4 |issue=1 |title=Soil consistency as a factor determining the soil structure of clay soils |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/211680 |year=1956 |pages=122–25 |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the engineering of foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Day |first=Robert W. |date=2000 |chapter=Soil mechanics and foundations |title=Building design and construction handbook |edition=6th |editor1-first=Frederick S. |editor1-last=Merritt |editor2-first=Jonathan T. |editor2-last=Rickett |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]] |location=New York, New York, USA |isbn=978-0070419995 |url=http://my.fit.edu/~locurcio/14-Civil%20&amp;%20Const%20handbooks/McGraw%20Hill%20-%20Design%20&amp;%20Const%20Handbook/06-Soils%20&amp;%20Foundations.pdf |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistency is measured at three moisture conditions: air-dry, moist, and wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/docs/CDrom/FAO_Training/FAO_Training/General/x6706e/x6706e08.htm |title=Soil consistency |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |location=Rome, Italy |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those conditions the consistency quality depends upon the clay content. In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.

The terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:

# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard
# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm
# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic
# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62–63, 565–67}}

Soil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads. More precise measures of soil strength are often made prior to construction.

Soil [[heat flux]] refers to the rate at which [[heat energy]] moves through the soil in response to a temperature difference between two points in the soil. The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction. For the simple case of conduction into or out of the soil in the vertical direction, which is most often applicable the heat flux density is:

: &lt;math&gt;q_x  = - k \frac{\delta T}{\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[SI]] units
: &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux density, in SI the units are [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the soils' [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.
: &lt;math&gt;\delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].
: &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.

Heat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign. That is to say, if the temperature of the surface is higher than at depth x the negative sign will result in a positive value for the heat flux q, and which is interpreted as the heat being conducted into the soil.

===Color===
{{Main|Soil color}}
Soil colour is often the first impression one has when viewing soil. Striking colours and contrasting patterns are especially noticeable. The [[Red River of the South]] carries sediment eroded from extensive reddish soils like [[Port Silt Loam]] in Oklahoma. The [[Yellow River]] in China carries yellow sediment from eroding loess soils. [[Mollisols]] in the [[Great Plains]] of North America are darkened and enriched by organic matter. [[Podsol]]s in [[Taiga|boreal forests]] have highly contrasting layers due to acidity and leaching.

In general, color is determined by the organic matter content, drainage conditions, and degree of oxidation. Soil color, while easily discerned, has little use in predicting soil characteristics.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=71}} It is of use in distinguishing boundaries of [[Soil horizon|horizons]] within a soil profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/sss/2014/03/30/soil-color-never-lies/ |publisher=[[European Geosciences Union]] |title=Soil color never lies |accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; determining the origin of a soil's [[parent material]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viscarra Rossel |first1=Raphael A. |last2=Cattle |first2=Stephen R. |last3=Ortega |first3=A. |last4=Fouad |first4=Youssef |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Geoderma |volume=150 |title=In situ measurements of soil colour, mineral composition and clay content by vis–NIR spectroscopy |year=2009 |pages=253–66 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an indication of wetness and [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogged]] conditions,&lt;ref name="Blavet"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blavet |first1=Didier |last2=Mathe |first2=E. |last3=Leprun |first3=Jean-Claude |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=39 |issue=3 |title=Relations between soil colour and waterlogging duration in a representative hillside of the West African granito-gneissic bedrock |url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_55-56/010021572.pdf |year=2000 |pages=187–210 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00087-9 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a qualitative means of measuring organic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shields |first1=J.

The rate at which a soil can absorb water depends on the soil and its other conditions. As a plant grows, its roots remove water from the largest pores ([[macropores]]) first. Soon the larger pores hold only air, and the remaining water is found only in the intermediate- and smallest-sized pores ([[micropores]]). The water in the smallest pores is so strongly held to particle surfaces that plant roots cannot pull it away. Consequently, not all soil water is available to plants, with a strong dependence on [[Soil texture|texture]].&lt;ref name="Easton"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/75545/BSE-194.pdf |last1=Easton |first1=Zachary M. |last2=Bock |first2=Emily |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil and soil water relationships |website=[[Virginia Tech]] |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When saturated, the soil may lose nutrients as the water drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sims |first1=J.

===Water retention forces===
{{Further|Soil water (retention)|Water retention curve}}
Water is retained in a soil when the [[adhesive force]] of attraction that water's [[hydrogen]] atoms have for the [[oxygen]] of soil particles is stronger than the cohesive forces that water's hydrogen feels for other water oxygen atoms.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–74}} When a field is flooded, the soil [[pore space]] is completely filled by water. The field will drain under the force of gravity until it reaches what is called [[field capacity]], at which point the smallest pores are filled with water and the largest with water and gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of water held when field capacity is reached is a function of the [[specific surface area]] of the soil particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petersen |first1=Lis Wollesen |last2=Møldrup |first2=Per |last3=Jacobsen |first3=Ole H. |last4=Rolston |first4=Dennis E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil Science |volume=161 |issue=1 |title=Relations between specific surface area and soil physical and chemical properties |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232162864 |year=1996 |pages=9–21 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199601000-00003 |accessdate=10 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, high clay and high organic soils have higher field capacities.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=Satish C. |last2=Larson |first2=William E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Water Resources Research]] |volume=15 |issue=6 |title=Estimating soil water retention characteristics from particle size distribution, organic matter percent, and bulk density |year=1979 |pages=1633–5 |doi=10.1029/WR015i006p01633 |bibcode=1979WRR....15.1633G |citeseerx=10.1.1.475.497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total force required to pull or push water out of soil is termed [[suction]] and usually expressed in units of bars (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pascal) which is just a little less than one-atmosphere pressure. Alternatively, the terms "soil moisture tension" or [[water potential]] may be used.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–75}}

===Moisture classification===
The forces with which water is held in soils determine its availability to plants. Forces of [[adhesion]] hold water strongly to mineral and humus surfaces and less strongly to itself by cohesive forces. A plant's root may penetrate a very small volume of water that is adhering to soil and be initially able to draw in water that is only lightly held by the cohesive forces. But as the droplet is drawn down, the forces of adhesion of the water for the soil particles produce increasingly higher [[suction]], finally up to 15&amp;nbsp;bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Savage |first1=Michael J. |last2=Ritchie |first2=Joe T. |last3=Bland |first3=William L. |last4=Dugas |first4=William A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agronomy Journal]] |volume=88 |issue=4 |title=Lower limit of soil water availability |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309079210 |year=1996 |pages=644–51 |doi=10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800040024x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 15&amp;nbsp;bar suction, the soil water amount is called [[wilting point]]. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration, the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts, although [[stoma]]tal closure may decrease transpiration and thus may retard wilting below the [[wilting point]], in particular under [[adaptation]] or [[acclimatization]] to drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Al-Ani |first1=Tariq |last2=Bierhuizen |first2=Johan Frederik |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Acta Botanica Neerlandica |volume=20 |issue=3 |title=Stomatal resistance, transpiration, and relative water content as influenced by soil moisture stress |url=http://natuurtijdschriften.nl/download?type=document&amp;docid=539770 |year=1971 |pages=318–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1438-8677.1971.tb00715.x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=75–76}}

===Soil moisture content===
{{see also|Soil moisture sensor|Moisture content}}
When the soil moisture content is optimal for plant growth, the water in the large and intermediate size pores can move about in the soil and be easily used by plants.&lt;ref name="Easton"/&gt; The amount of water remaining in a soil drained to field capacity and the amount that is available are functions of the soil type. Sandy soil will retain very little water, while clay will hold the maximum amount.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"/&gt; The time required to drain a field from flooded condition for a clay [[loam]] that begins at 43% water by weight to a field capacity of 22% is six days, whereas a sand loam that is flooded to its maximum of 22% water will take two days to reach field capacity of 11% water. The available water for the clay loam might be 11% whereas for the sand loam it might be only 8% by weight.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=76–77}}

The above are average values for the soil textures as the percentages of sand, silt and clay vary.

===Water flow===
Water moves through soil due to the force of [[gravity]], [[osmosis]] and [[capillarity]]. At zero to one-third bar [[suction]], water is pushed through soil from the point of its application under the force of gravity and the pressure gradient created by the pressure of the water; this is called saturated flow. At higher suction, water movement is pulled by capillarity from wetter toward drier soil. This is caused by water's [[adhesion]] to soil solids, and is called unsaturated flow.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagri.org/eagri50/AGRO103/lec03.pdf |title=Soil water movement: saturated and unsaturated flow and vapour movement, soil moisture constants and their importance in irrigation |website=[[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water infiltration and movement in soil is controlled by six factors:

# Soil texture
# Soil structure. Fine-textured soils with granular structure are most favourable to infiltration of water.
# The amount of organic matter. Coarse matter is best and if on the surface helps prevent the destruction of soil structure and the creation of crusts.
# Depth of soil to impervious layers such as hardpans or bedrock
# The amount of water already in the soil
# Soil temperature. Warm soils take in water faster while frozen soils may not be able to absorb depending on the type of freezing.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=86}}

Water infiltration rates range from {{convert|0.25|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for high clay soils to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for sand and well stabilised and aggregated soil structures.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=88}} Water flows through the ground unevenly, in the form of so-called "gravity fingers", because of the [[surface tension]] between water particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cueto-Felgueroso |first1=Luis |last2=Juanes |first2=Ruben |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=101 |issue=24 |title=Nonlocal interface dynamics and pattern formation in gravity-driven unsaturated flow through porous media |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bcee/6f04cc7a8bc8df98d0cb48410ccb1efb6a33.pdf |year=2008 |pages=244504 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.244504 |pmid=19113626 |accessdate=21 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2008PhRvL.101x4504C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soilandwater.bee.cornell.edu/research/pfweb/educators/intro/fingerflow.htm |title=Finger flow in coarse soils |website=[[Cornell University]] |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water uptake by plants===
Of equal importance to the storage and movement of water in soil is the means by which plants acquire it and their nutrients. Most soil water is taken up by plants as passive [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] caused by the pulling force of water evaporating ([[transpiration|transpiring]]) from the long column of water ([[xylem sap]] flow) that leads from the plant's roots to its leaves, according to the [[cohesion-tension theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aston |first1=M.

Root extension is vital for plant survival. A study of a single winter rye plant grown for four months in one cubic foot of loam soil showed that the plant developed 13,800,000 roots, a total of 385&amp;nbsp;miles in length with 2,550&amp;nbsp;square feet in surface area; and 14&amp;nbsp;billion hair roots of 6,600&amp;nbsp;miles total length and 4,320&amp;nbsp;square feet total area; for a total surface area of 6,870&amp;nbsp;square feet (83&amp;nbsp;ft squared). The total surface area of the loam soil was estimated to be 560,000&amp;nbsp;square feet.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=46}} In other words, the roots were in contact with only 1.2% of the soil. However, root extension should be viewed as a dynamic process, allowing new roots to explore a new volume of soil each day, increasing dramatically the total volume of soil explored over a given growth period, and thus the volume of water taken up by the root system over this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kramer |first1=Paul J. |last2=Coile |first2=Theodore S. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |title=An estimation of the volume of water made available by root extension |year=1940 |pages=743–7 |doi=10.1104/pp.15.4.743 |pmid=16653671 |pmc=437871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Root architecture, i.e. the spatial configuration of the root system, plays a prominent role in the adaptation of plants to soil water and nutrient availabiity, and thus in plant productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lynch |first=Jonathan |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=109 |issue=1 |title=Root architecture and plant productivity |year=1995 |pages=7–13 |doi=10.1104/pp.109.1.7 |pmid=12228579 |pmc=157559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roots must seek out water as the unsaturated flow of water in soil can move only at a rate of up to 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (one inch) per day; as a result they are constantly dying and growing as they seek out high concentrations of soil moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Comas |first1=Louise H. |last2=Eissenstat |first2=David M. |last3=Lakso |first3=Alan N. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=147 |issue=1 |title=Assessing root death and root system dynamics in a study of grape canopy pruning |year=2000 |pages=171–8 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00679.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insufficient soil moisture, to the point of causing [[wilting]], will cause permanent damage and [[crop yield]]s will suffer.

===Consumptive use and water use efficiency===
Only a small fraction (0.1% to 1%) of the water used by a plant is held within the plant. The majority is ultimately lost via [[transpiration]], while [[evaporation]] from the soil surface is also substantial, the transpiration:evaporation ratio varying according to vegetation type and climate, peaking in [[tropical rainforests]] and dipping in [[steppes]] and [[deserts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlesinger |first1=William H. |last2=Jasechko |first2=Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agricultural and Forest Meteorology]] |volume=189/190 |title=Transpiration in the global water cycle |url=http://www.isohydro.ca/uploads/1/4/1/9/14194300/2014-schlesinger-jasechko-agformet.pdf |year=2014 |pages=115–7 |doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.01.011 |accessdate=22 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2014AgFM..189..115S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transpiration plus evaporative soil moisture loss is called [[evapotranspiration]].

The total water used in an agricultural field includes [[surface runoff]], [[drainage]] and consumptive use. The use of loose [[mulch]]es will reduce evaporative losses for a period after a field is irrigated, but in the end the total evaporative loss (plant plus soil) will approach that of an uncovered soil, while more water is immediately available for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tolk |first1=Judy A. |last2=Howell |first2=Terry A. |last3=Evett |first3=Steve R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil and Tillage Research |volume=50 |issue=2 |title=Effect of mulch, irrigation, and soil type on water use and yield of maize |url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/pubag/downloadPDF.xhtml?id=1896&amp;content=PDF |year=1999 |pages=137–47 |doi=10.1016/S0167-1987(99)00011-2 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water use efficiency]] is measured by the [[transpiration ratio]], which is the ratio of the total water transpired by a plant to the dry weight of the harvested plant. Transpiration ratios for crops range from 300 to 700. For example, alfalfa may have a transpiration ratio of 500 and as a result 500&amp;nbsp;kilograms of water will produce one&amp;nbsp;kilogram of dry alfalfa.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=97–99}}

==Atmosphere==
The atmosphere of soil, or [[soil gas]], is radically different from the atmosphere above. The consumption of [[oxygen]] by microbes and plant roots, and their release of [[carbon dioxide]], decrease oxygen and increase carbon dioxide concentration. Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 0.04%, but in the soil [[pore space]] it may range from 10 to 100 times that level, thus potentially contributing to the inhibition of root respiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Qi |first1=Jingen |last2=Marshall |first2=John D. |last3=Mattson |first3=Kim G. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=128 |issue=3 |title=High soil carbon dioxide concentrations inhibit root respiration of Douglas fir |year=1994 |pages=435–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02989.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcareous soils regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration thanks to [[carbonate]] [[Buffering agent|buffering]], contrary to acid soils in which all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respired accumulates in the soil pore system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karberg |first1=Noah J. |last2=Pregitzer |first2=Kurt S. |last3=King |first3=John S. |last4=Friend |first4=Aaron L. |last5=Wood |first5=James R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=142 |issue=2 |title=Soil carbon dioxide partial pressure and dissolved inorganic carbonate chemistry under elevated carbon dioxide and ozone |url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2004/nc_2004_Karberg_001.pdf |year=2005 |pages=296–306 |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1665-5 |pmid=15378342 |accessdate=26 August 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At extreme levels CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=H.

* '''Illite''' is a 2:1 clay similar in structure to montmorillonite but has potassium bridges between the faces of the clay crystals and the degree of swelling depends on the degree of weathering of the potassium. The active surface area is reduced due to the potassium bonds. Illite originates from the modification of mica, a primary mineral. It is often found together with montmorillonite and its primary minerals. It has moderate CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=108–10}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Vermiculite''' is a mica-based clay similar to illite, but the crystals of clay are held together more loosely by hydrated magnesium and it will swell, but not as much as does montmorillonite. It has very high CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=73}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Chlorite''' is similar to vermiculite, but the loose bonding by occasional hydrated magnesium, as in vermiculite, is replaced by a hydrated magnesium sheet, that firmly bonds the planes above and below it. It has two planes of silicon, one of aluminium and one of magnesium; hence it is a 2:2 clay. Chlorite does not swell and it has low CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|p=112}}
* '''Kaolinite''' is very common, highly weathered clay, and more common than montmorillonite in acid soils. It has one silica and one alumina plane per crystal; hence it is a 1:1 type clay. One plane of silica of montmorillonite is dissolved and is replaced with hydroxyls, which produces strong hydrogen bonds to the oxygen in the next crystal of clay. As a result, kaolinite does not swell in water and has a low specific surface area, and as almost no isomorphous substitution has occurred it has a low CEC. Where rainfall is high, acid soils selectively leach more silica than alumina from the original clays, leaving kaolinite. Even heavier weathering results in sesquioxide clays.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=33}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=74}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=101}}

====Crystalline chain clays====
The carbonate and sulfate minerals are much more soluble and hence are found primarily in desert soils where leaching is less active.

====Amorphous clays====
'''Amorphous clays''' are young, and commonly found in volcanic ash. They are mixtures of alumina and silica which have not formed the ordered crystal shape of alumino-silica clays which time would provide. The majority of their negative charges originates from hydroxyl ions, which can gain or lose a hydrogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in response to soil pH, in such way was as to buffer the soil pH. They may have either a negative charge provided by the attached hydroxyl ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), which can attract a cation, or lose the hydrogen of the hydroxyl to solution and display a positive charge which can attract anions. As a result, they may display either high CEC in an acid soil solution, or high anion exchange capacity in a basic soil solution.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}

====Sesquioxide clays====
'''[[Sesquioxide]] clays''' are a product of heavy rainfall that has leached most of the silica from alumino-silica clay, leaving the less soluble oxides iron hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), aluminium hydroxide gibbsite (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrated manganese birnessite (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It takes hundreds of thousands of years of leaching to create sesquioxide clays. ''Sesqui'' is Latin for "one and one-half": there are three parts oxygen to two parts iron or aluminium; hence the ratio is one and one-half (not true for all). They are hydrated and act as either amorphous or crystalline. They are not sticky and do not swell, and soils high in them behave much like sand and can rapidly pass water. They are able to hold large quantities of phosphates. Sesquioxides have low CEC but are able to hold anions as well as cations. Such soils range from yellow to red in colour. Such clays tend to hold phosphorus so tightly that it is unavailable for absorption by plants.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=103–12}}{{sfn|Simonson|1957|pp=18, 21–24, 29}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32, 35}}

===Organic colloids===
[[Humus]] is the final state of decomposition of organic matter. While it may linger for a thousand years, on the larger scale of the age of the mineral soil components, it is temporary. It is composed of the very stable [[lignin]]s (30%) and complex sugars ([[polyuronide]]s, 30%), proteins (30%), waxes, and fats that are resistant to breakdown by microbes. Its chemical assay is 60% carbon, 5% nitrogen, some oxygen and the remainder hydrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. On a dry weight basis, the CEC of humus is many times greater than that of clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=112}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=35}}{{sfn|Allaway|1957|p=69}}

===Carbon and terra preta===
In the extreme environment of high temperatures and the leaching caused by the heavy rain of tropical rain forests, the clay and organic colloids are largely destroyed. The heavy rains wash the alumino-silicate clays from the soil leaving only sesquioxide clays of low CEC. The high temperatures and humidity allow bacteria and fungi to virtually dissolve any organic matter on the rain-forest floor overnight and much of the nutrients are volatilized or leached from the soil and lost. However, carbon in the form of charcoal is far more stable than soil colloids and is capable of performing many of the functions of the soil colloids of sub-tropical soils. Soil containing substantial quantities of charcoal, of an anthropogenic origin, is called [[terra preta]]. Research into terra preta is still young but is promising. Fallow periods "on the Amazonian Dark Earths can be as short as 6 months, whereas fallow periods on [[oxisol]]s are usually 8 to 10 years long"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehmann|first=J.|title=Terra Preta de Indio|url=http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|publisher=University of Cornell, Dept. of Crop and Soil Sciences|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424061552/http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{for|the [[academic discipline]]|Soil chemistry}}

The chemistry of a soil determines its ability to supply available [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] and affects its physical properties and the health of its microbial population. In addition, a soil's chemistry also determines its corrosivity, stability, and ability to absorb pollutants and to filter water. It is the surface chemistry of mineral and organic [[colloids]] that determines soil's chemical properties. "A colloid is a small, insoluble, nondiffusible particle larger than a molecule but small enough to remain suspended in a fluid medium without settling. Most soils contain organic colloidal particles called humus as well as the inorganic colloidal particles of clays." The very high [[specific surface area]] of colloids and their net charges, gives soil its ability to hold and release ions. Negatively charged sites on colloids attract and release cations in what is referred to as cation exchange. [[Cation-exchange capacity]] (CEC) is the amount of exchangeable cations per unit weight of dry soil and is expressed in terms of milliequivalents of positively charged ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (or centimoles of positive charge per kilogram of soil; cmol&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/kg). Similarly, positively charged sites on colloids can attract and release anions in the soil giving the soil [[cation-exchange capacity|anion exchange capacity]] (AEC).

===Cation and anion exchange===
{{Further|Cation-exchange capacity}}
The cation exchange, that takes place between colloids and soil water, buffers (moderates) soil pH, alters soil structure, and purifies percolating water by adsorbing cations of all types, both useful and harmful.

The negative or positive charges on colloid particles make them able to hold cations or anions, respectively, to their surfaces. The charges result from four sources.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=103–06}}

# Isomorphous substitution occurs in clay during its formation, when lower-valence cations substitute for higher-valence cations in the crystal structure. Substitutions in the outermost layers are more effective than for the innermost layers, as the charge strength drops off as the square of the distance. The net result is oxygen atoms with net negative charge and the ability to attract cations.
# Edge-of-clay oxygen atoms are not in balance ionically as the tetrahedral and octahedral structures are incomplete.
# Hydroxyls may substitute for oxygens of the silica layers. When the hydrogens of the clay hydroxyls are ionised into solution, they leave the oxygen with a negative charge.
# Hydrogens of humus hydroxyl groups may be ionised into solution, leaving an oxygen with a negative charge.

Cations held to the negatively charged colloids resist being washed downward by water and out of reach of plants' roots, thereby preserving the fertility of soils in areas of moderate rainfall and low temperatures.

There is a hierarchy in the process of cation exchange on colloids, as they differ in the strength of adsorption by the colloid and hence their ability to replace one another. If present in equal amounts in the soil water solution:

Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; same as NH&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

If one cation is added in large amounts, it may replace the others by the sheer force of its numbers. This is called mass action. This is largely what occurs with the addition of fertiliser.

As the soil solution becomes more acidic (low pH, and an abundance of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the other cations more weakly bound to colloids are pushed into solution as hydrogen ions occupy those sites. A low pH may cause hydrogen of hydroxyl groups to be pulled into solution, leaving charged sites on the colloid available to be occupied by other cations. This ionisation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of soil colloids creates what is described as pH-dependent charges. Unlike permanent charges developed by isomorphous substitution, pH-dependent charges are variable and increase with increasing pH.&lt;ref name="CEC"/&gt; Freed cations can be made available to plants but are also prone to be leached from the soil, possibly making the soil less fertile. Plants are able to excrete H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the soil and by that means, change the pH of the soil near the root and push cations off the colloids, thus making those available to the plant.

====Cation exchange capacity (CEC)====
Cation exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove cations from the soil water solution and sequester those to be exchanged later as the plant roots release hydrogen ions to the solution. CEC is the amount of exchangeable hydrogen cation (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) that will combine with 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry weight of soil and whose measure is one milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (1&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g). Hydrogen ions have a single charge and one-thousandth of a gram of hydrogen ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry soil gives a measure of one milliequivalent of hydrogen ion. Calcium, with an atomic weight 40 times that of hydrogen and with a valence of two, converts to (40/2) x 1 milliequivalent = 20 milliequivalents of hydrogen ion per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of dry soil or 20&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=114}} The modern measure of CEC is expressed as centimoles of positive charge per kilogram (cmol/kg) of oven-dry soil.

Most of the soil's CEC occurs on clay and humus colloids, and the lack of those in hot, humid, wet climates, due to leaching and decomposition respectively, explains the relative sterility of tropical soils. Live plant roots also have some CEC.

====Anion exchange capacity (AEC)====
Anion exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove anions from the soil water solution and sequester those for later exchange as the plant roots release carbonate anions to the soil water solution. Those colloids which have low CEC tend to have some AEC. Amorphous and sesquioxide clays have the highest AEC, followed by the iron oxides. Levels of AEC are much lower than for CEC. Phosphates tend to be held at anion exchange sites.

Iron and aluminum hydroxide clays are able to exchange their hydroxide anions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) for other anions. The order reflecting the strength of anion adhesion is as follows:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The amount of exchangeable anions is of a magnitude of tenths to a few milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;g dry soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=115–16}} As pH rises, there are relatively more hydroxyls, which will displace anions from the colloids and force them into solution and out of storage; hence AEC decreases with increasing pH (alkalinity).

===Reactivity (pH)===
{{Main|Soil pH|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Soil reactivity is expressed in terms of pH and is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. More precisely, it is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution and ranges in values from 0 to 14 (acidic to basic) but practically speaking for soils, pH ranges from 3.5 to 9.5, as pH values beyond those extremes are toxic to life forms.

At 25&amp;nbsp;°C an aqueous solution that has a pH of 3.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−3.5&lt;/sup&gt; [[mole (unit)|moles]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (hydrogen ions) per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−10.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole/litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 7, defined as neutral, has 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per litre; since the two concentrations are equal, they are said to neutralise each other. A pH of 9.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−9.5&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−2.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole per litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 3.5 has one million times more hydrogen ions per litre than a solution with pH of 9.5 (9.5 - 3.5  = 6 or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) and is more acidic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Raymond|title=Chemistry|year=1984|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=978-0394329833|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of pH on a soil is to remove from the soil or to make available certain ions. Soils with high acidity tend to have toxic amounts of aluminium and manganese. Plants which need calcium need moderate alkalinity, but most minerals are more soluble in acid soils. Soil organisms are hindered by high acidity, and most agricultural crops do best with mineral soils of pH&amp;nbsp;6.5 and organic soils of pH&amp;nbsp;5.5.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–17}}

In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain as those attach to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil sterile. Once the colloids are saturated with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH&amp;nbsp;10. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of [[gypsum]] (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–19}}

====Base saturation percentage====
There are acid-forming cations (hydrogen and aluminium) and there are base-forming cations. The fraction of the base-forming cations that occupy positions on the soil colloids is called the base saturation percentage. If a soil has a CEC of 20 meq and 5 meq are aluminium and hydrogen cations (acid-forming), the remainder of positions on the colloids (20-5 = 15 meq) are assumed occupied by base-forming cations, so that the percentage base saturation is 15/20 x 100% = 75% (the compliment 25% is assumed acid-forming cations). When the soil pH is 7 (neutral), base saturation is 100&amp;nbsp;percent and there are no hydrogen ions stored on the colloids. Base saturation is almost in direct proportion to pH (increases with increasing pH). It is of use in calculating the amount of lime needed to neutralise an acid soil. The amount of lime needed to neutralize a soil must take account of the amount of acid forming ions on the colloids not just those in the soil water solution. The addition of enough lime to neutralize the soil water solution will be insufficient to change the pH, as the acid forming cations stored on the soil colloids will tend to restore the original pH condition as they are pushed off those colloids by the calcium of the added lime.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=119–20}}

===Buffering===
{{Further|Soil conditioner}}
The resistance of soil to change in pH, as a result of the addition of acid or basic material, is a measure of the buffering capacity of a soil and (for a particular soil type) increases as the CEC increases. Hence, pure sand has almost no buffering ability, while soils high in colloids have high buffering capacity. Buffering occurs by cation exchange and neutralisation.

The addition of a small amount highly basic aqueous ammonia to a soil will cause the ammonium to displace hydrogen ions from the colloids, and the end product is water and colloidally fixed ammonium, but little permanent change overall in soil pH.

The addition of a small amount of [[liming (soil)|lime]], Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, will displace hydrogen ions from the soil colloids, causing the fixation of calcium to colloids and the evolution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, with little permanent change in soil pH.

The above are examples of the buffering of soil pH. The general principal is that an increase in a particular cation in the soil water solution will cause that cation to be fixed to colloids (buffered) and a decrease in solution of that cation will cause it to be withdrawn from the colloid and moved into solution (buffered). The degree of buffering is often related to the CEC of the soil; the greater the CEC, the greater the buffering capacity of the soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=120–21}}

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Plant nutrition|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Sixteen elements or nutrients are essential for plant growth and reproduction. They are [[carbon]] '''C''', [[hydrogen]] '''H''', [[oxygen]] '''O''', [[nitrogen]] '''N''', [[phosphorus]] '''P''', [[potassium]] '''K''', [[sulfur]] '''S''', [[calcium]] '''Ca''', [[magnesium]] '''Mg''', [[iron]] '''Fe''', [[boron]] '''B''', [[manganese]] '''Mn''', [[copper]] '''Cu''', [[zinc]] '''Zn''', [[molybdenum]] '''Mo''', [[nickel]] '''Ni''' and [[chlorine]] '''Cl'''.{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Russel|1957|pp=123–25}}&lt;ref name = BradyWeil&gt;{{cite book | title = The nature and properties of soils | year = 2008 | edition = 14th | last1 = Brady | first1 = Nyle C. | last2 = Weil | first2 = Ray R. | publisher = Pearson | location = Upper Saddle River, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients required for plants to complete their life cycle are considered '''essential nutrients'''. Nutrients that enhance the growth of plants but are not necessary to complete the plant's life cycle are considered '''non-essential'''. With the exception of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, which are supplied by carbon dioxide and water, and nitrogen, provided through [[nitrogen fixation]],&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; the nutrients derive originally from the mineral component of the soil.

Plant uptake of nutrients can only proceed when they are present in a plant-available form. In most situations, nutrients are absorbed in an ionic form from (or together with) soil water. Although minerals are the origin of most nutrients, and the bulk of most nutrient elements in the soil is held in crystalline form within primary and secondary minerals, they [[weathering|weather]] too slowly to support rapid plant growth. For example, The application of finely ground minerals, [[feldspar]] and [[apatite]], to soil seldom provides the necessary amounts of potassium and phosphorus at a rate sufficient for good plant growth, as most of the nutrients remain bound in the crystals of those minerals.{{sfn|Dean|1957|pp=80–81}}

The nutrients adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay colloids and [[soil organic matter]] provide a more accessible reservoir of many plant nutrients (e.g. K, Ca, Mg, P, Zn). As plants absorb the nutrients from the soil water, the soluble pool is replenished from the surface-bound pool. The decomposition of [[soil organic matter]] by microorganisms is another mechanism whereby the soluble pool of nutrients is replenished – this is important for the supply of plant-available N, S, P, and B from soil.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/soilbiodiversity/Downloadable_files/fpnb16.pdf|title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management|last1=Roy|first1=R.N.|last2=Finck|first2=A.|last3=Blair|first3=G.J.|last4=Tandon|first4=H.L.S.|date=2006|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=|isbn=978-9251054901|location=Rome|pages=43–90|chapter=Chapter 4: Soil fertility and crop production|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gram for gram, the capacity of humus to hold nutrients and water is far greater than that of clay minerals. All in all, small amounts of humus may remarkably increase the soil's capacity to promote plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–31}}&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;

===Uptake processes===
Nutrients in the soil are taken up by the plant through its roots. To be taken up by a plant, a nutrient element must be located near the root surface; however, the supply of nutrients in contact with the root is rapidly depleted. There are three basic mechanisms whereby nutrient ions dissolved in the soil solution are brought into contact with plant roots:

# Mass flow of water
# Diffusion within water
# Interception by root growth

All three mechanisms operate simultaneously, but one mechanism or another may be most important for a particular nutrient. For example, in the case of calcium, which is generally plentiful in the soil solution, mass flow alone can usually bring sufficient amounts to the root surface. However, in the case of phosphorus, diffusion is needed to supplement mass flow. For the most part, nutrient ions must travel some distance in the soil solution to reach the root surface. This movement can take place by mass flow, as when dissolved nutrients are carried along with the soil water flowing toward a root that is actively drawing water from the soil. In this type of movement, the nutrient ions are somewhat analogous to leaves floating down a stream. In addition, nutrient ions continually move by diffusion from areas of greater concentration toward the nutrient-depleted areas of lower concentration around the root surface. That process is due to random motion of molecules. By this means, plants can continue to take up nutrients even at night, when water is only slowly absorbed into the roots as transpiration has almost stopped. Finally, root interception comes into play as roots continually grow into new, undepleted soil.

In the above table, phosphorus and potassium nutrients move more by diffusion than they do by mass flow in the soil water solution, as they are rapidly taken up by the roots creating a concentration of almost zero near the roots (the plants cannot transpire enough water to draw more of those nutrients near the roots). The very steep concentration gradient is of greater influence in the movement of those ions than is the movement of those by mass flow.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement by mass flow requires the transpiration of water from the plant causing water and solution ions to also move toward the roots. Movement by root interception is slowest as the plants must extend their roots.

Plants move ions out of their roots in an effort to move nutrients in from the soil. Hydrogen H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is exchanged for other cations, and carbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) anions are exchanged for nutrient anions. As plant roots remove nutrients from the soil water solution, they are replenished as other ions move off of clay and humus (by [[ion exchange]] or [[desorption]]), are added from the [[weathering]] of soil minerals, and are released by the [[Soil organic matter#Decomposition|decomposition of soil organic matter]]. Plants derive a large proportion of their anion nutrients from decomposing organic matter, which typically holds about 95&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil nitrogen, 5 to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil phosphorus and about 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil sulfur. Where crops are produced, the replenishment of nutrients in the soil must usually be augmented by the addition of fertilizer or organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=126}}

Because nutrient uptake is an active metabolic process, conditions that inhibit root metabolism may also inhibit nutrient uptake. Examples of such conditions include [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] or [[soil compaction]] resulting in poor soil aeration, excessively high or low soil temperatures, and above-ground conditions that result in low translocation of sugars to plant roots.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–28}}

===Carbon===
[[File:SRS2000 soil respiration system.jpg|thumb|Measuring soil respiration in the field using an SRS2000 system.]]
Plants obtain their carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide. About 45% of a plant's dry mass is carbon; plant residues typically have a carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of between 13:1 and 100:1. As the soil organic material is digested by arthropods and micro-organisms, the C/N decreases as the carbonaceous material is metabolized and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is released as a byproduct which then finds its way out of the soil and into the atmosphere. The nitrogen is sequestered in the bodies of the living matter of those decomposing organisms and so it builds up in the soil. Normal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere is 0.03%, this can be the factor limiting plant growth. In a field of maize on a still day during high light conditions in the growing season, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration drops very low, but under such conditions the crop could use up to 20 times the normal concentration. The respiration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by soil micro-organisms decomposing soil organic matter contributes an important amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the photosynthesising plants. Within the soil, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 10 to 100 times that of atmospheric levels but may rise to toxic levels if the soil porosity is low or if diffusion is impeded by flooding.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=41}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|p=153}}

===Nitrogen===
{{Further|Nitrogen cycle}}
[[File:SoilNitrogen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Generalization of percent soil nitrogen by soil order}}]]
Nitrogen is the most critical element obtained by plants from the soil and [[nitrogen deficiency]] often limits plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=128}} Plants can use the nitrogen as either the ammonium cation (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or the anion nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Usually, most of the nitrogen in soil is bound within organic compounds that make up the soil organic matter, and must be [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralized]] to the ammonium or nitrate form before it can be taken up by most plants. The total nitrogen content depends largely on the soil organic matter content, which in turn depends on the climate, vegetation, topography, age and soil management. Soil nitrogen typically decreases by 0.2 to 0.3% for every temperature increase by 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Usually, grassland soils contain more soil nitrogen than forest soils. Cultivation decreases soil nitrogen by exposing soil organic matter to decomposition by microorganisms, and soils under no-tillage maintain more soil nitrogen than tilled soils.

Some micro-organisms are able to metabolise organic matter and release ammonium in a process called ''mineralisation''. Others take free ammonium and oxidise it to nitrate. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are capable of metabolising N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the form of ammonia in a process called [[nitrogen fixation]]. Both ammonium and nitrate can be ''immobilized'' by their incorporation into the microbes' living cells, where it is temporarily sequestered in the form of amino acids and protein. Nitrate may also be lost from the soil when bacteria metabolise it to the gases N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The loss of gaseous forms of nitrogen to the atmosphere due to microbial action is called ''denitrification''. Nitrogen may also be ''leached'' from the soil if it is in the form of nitrate or lost to the atmosphere as ammonia due to a chemical reaction of ammonium with alkaline soil by way of a process called ''volatilisation''. Ammonium may also be sequestered in clay by ''fixation''. A small amount of nitrogen is added to soil by rainfall.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Allison|1957|pp=85–94}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|pp=152–55}}{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–31}}

====Gains====
In the process of [[mineralization (soil)|mineralisation]], microbes feed on organic matter, releasing ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and other nutrients. As long as the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of fresh residues in the soil is above 30:1, nitrogen will be in short supply and other bacteria will feed on the ammonium and incorporate its nitrogen into their cells in the [[immobilization (soil science)|immobilization]] process. In that form the nitrogen is said to be ''immobilised''. Later, when such bacteria die, they too are ''mineralised'' and some of the nitrogen is released as ammonium and nitrate. If the C/N is less than 15, ammonia is freed to the soil, where it may be used by bacteria which [[redox|oxidise]] it to nitrate ([[nitrification]]). Bacteria may on average add {{convert|25|lb}} nitrogen per acre, and in an unfertilised field, this is the most important source of usable nitrogen. In a soil with 5% organic matter perhaps 2 to 5% of that is released to the soil by such decomposition. It occurs fastest in warm, moist, well aerated soil. The mineralisation of 3% of the organic material of a soil that is 4% organic matter overall, would release {{convert|120|lb}} of nitrogen as ammonium per acre.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=129–30}}

In [[nitrogen fixation]], [[rhizobium]] bacteria convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Rhizobia]] share a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with host plants, since rhizobia supply the host with nitrogen and the host provides rhizobia with nutrients and a safe environment. It is estimated that such symbiotic bacteria in the [[root nodule]]s of [[legume]]s add 45 to 250&amp;nbsp;pounds of nitrogen per acre per year, which may be sufficient for the crop. Other, free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and [[blue-green algae]] live independently in the soil and release nitrate when their dead bodies are converted by way of mineralisation.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–29}}

Some amount of usable nitrogen is fixed by [[lightning]] as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Nitrogen dioxide is soluble in water to form [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solution of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, previously released from the soil or from combustion, may fall with precipitation as nitric acid at a rate of about five pounds nitrogen per acre per year.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=87}}

====Sequestration====
When bacteria feed on soluble forms of nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), they temporarily sequester that nitrogen in their bodies in a process called ''immobilisation''. At a later time when those bacteria die, their nitrogen may be released as ammonium by the processes of mineralisation.

Protein material is easily broken down, but the rate of its decomposition is slowed by its attachment to the crystalline structure of clay and when trapped between the clay layers. The layers are small enough that bacteria cannot enter. Some organisms can exude extracellular enzymes that can act on the sequestered proteins. However, those enzymes too may be trapped on the clay crystals.

Ammonium fixation occurs when ammonium pushes [[potassium]] ions from between the layers of clay such as [[illite]] or [[montmorillonite]]. Only a small fraction of soil nitrogen is held this way.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}

====Losses====
Usable nitrogen may be lost from soils when it is in the form of nitrate, as it is easily [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]]. Further losses of nitrogen occur by denitrification, the process whereby soil bacteria convert nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to nitrogen gas, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This occurs when poor [[soil aeration]] limits free oxygen, forcing bacteria to use the oxygen in nitrate for their respiratory process. Denitrification increases when oxidisable organic material is available and when soils are warm and slightly acidic. Denitrification may vary throughout a soil as the aeration varies from place to place. Denitrification may cause the loss of 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;percent of the available nitrates within a day and when conditions are favourable to that process, losses of up to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of nitrate applied as fertiliser may occur.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=130}}

''Ammonium volatilisation'' occurs when ammonium reacts chemically with an alkaline soil, converting NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The application of ammonium fertiliser to such a field can result in volatilisation losses of as much as 30 percent.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Phosphorus===
After nitrogen, phosphorus is probably the element most likely to be deficient in soils. The soil mineral [[apatite]] is the most common mineral source of phosphorus. While there is on average 1000&amp;nbsp;lb of phosphorus per acre in the soil, it is generally in the form of phosphates with low solubility. Total phosphorus is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;percent by weight of the soil, but only one percent of that is available. Of the part available, more than half comes from the mineralisation of organic matter. Agricultural fields may need to be fertilised to make up for the phosphorus that has been removed in the crop.{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}

When phosphorus does form solubilised ions of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, they rapidly form insoluble phosphates of calcium or hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum. Phosphorus is largely immobile in the soil and is not leached but actually builds up in the surface layer if not cropped. The application of soluble fertilisers to soils may result in zinc deficiencies as zinc phosphates form. Conversely, the application of zinc to soils may immobilise phosphorus again as zinc phosphate. Lack of phosphorus may interfere with the normal opening of the plant leaf stomata, resulting in plant temperatures 10 percent higher than normal. Phosphorus is most available when soil pH is 6.5 in mineral soils and 5.5 in organic soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Potassium===
The amount of potassium in a soil may be as much as 80,000&amp;nbsp;lb per acre-foot, of which only 150&amp;nbsp;lb is available for plant growth. Common mineral sources of potassium are the mica [[biotite]] and potassium feldspar, KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. When solubilised, half will be held as exchangeable cations on clay while the other half is in the soil water solution. Potassium fixation often occurs when soils dry and the potassium is bonded between layers of illite clay. Under certain conditions, dependent on the soil texture, intensity of drying, and initial amount of exchangeable potassium, the fixed percentage may be as much as 90&amp;nbsp;percent within ten minutes. Potassium may be leached from soils low in clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=134–35}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|pp=101–04}}

===Calcium===
Calcium is one percent by weight of soils and is generally available but may be low as it is soluble and can be leached. It is thus low in sandy and heavily leached soil or strongly acidic mineral soil. Calcium is supplied to the plant in the form of exchangeable ions and moderately soluble minerals. Calcium is more available on the soil colloids than is potassium because the common mineral calcite, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is more soluble than potassium-bearing minerals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=135–36}}

===Magnesium===
Magnesium is one of the dominant exchangeable cations in most soils (as are calcium and potassium). Primary minerals that weather to release magnesium include [[hornblende]], [[biotite]] and [[vermiculite]]. Soil magnesium concentrations are generally sufficient for optimal plant growth, but highly weathered and sandy soils may be magnesium deficient due to leaching by heavy precipitation.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}}

===Sulfur===
Most sulfur is made available to plants, like phosphorus, by its release from decomposing organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}} Deficiencies may exist in some soils (especially sandy soils) and if cropped, sulfur needs to be added. The application of large quantities of nitrogen to fields that have marginal amounts of sulfur may cause sulfur deficiency in the rapidly growing plants by the plant's growth outpacing the supply of sulfur. A 15-ton crop of onions uses up to 19&amp;nbsp;lb of sulfur and 4&amp;nbsp;tons of alfalfa uses 15&amp;nbsp;lb per acre. Sulfur abundance varies with depth. In a sample of soils in Ohio, United States, the sulfur abundance varied with depths, 0-6&amp;nbsp;inches, 6-12&amp;nbsp;inches, 12-18&amp;nbsp;inches, 18-24&amp;nbsp;inches in the amounts: 1056, 830, 686, 528&amp;nbsp;lb per acre respectively.{{sfn|Jordan|Reisenauer|1957|p=107}}

===Micronutrients===
The micronutrients essential in plant life, in their order of importance, include  [[iron]],{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|pp=111}} [[manganese]],{{sfn|Sherman|1957|p=135}} [[zinc]],{{sfn|Seatz|Jurinak|1957|p=115}} [[copper]],{{sfn|Reuther|1957|p=128}} [[boron]],{{sfn|Russel|1957|p=121}} [[chlorine]]{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=146}} and [[molybdenum]].{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=141}} The term refers to plants' needs, not to their abundance in soil. They are required in very small amounts but are essential to plant health in that most are required parts of some enzyme system which speeds up plants' metabolisms. They are generally available in the mineral component of the soil, but the heavy application of phosphates can cause a deficiency in zinc and iron by the formation of insoluble zinc and iron phosphates. Iron deficiency may also result from excessive amounts of heavy metals or calcium minerals (lime) in the soil. Excess amounts of soluble boron, molybdenum and chloride are toxic.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=136–37}}{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=107}}

===Non-essential nutrients===
Nutrients which enhance the health but whose deficiency does not stop the life cycle of plants include: [[cobalt]], [[strontium]], [[vanadium]], [[silicon]] and [[nickel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faria Pereira|first1=B.F.|title=Nutrients and Nonessential Elements in Soil after 11 Years of Wastewater Irrigation|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/41/3/920|website=ACSESS Digital Library|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their importance are evaluated they may be added to the list of essential plant nutrients.

==Soil organic matter==
{{main|Soil organic matter}}
Soil organic matter is made up of [[organic compounds]] and includes plant, animal and microbial material, both living and dead. A typical soil has a biomass composition of 70% microorganisms, 22% macrofauna, and 8% roots. The living component of an acre of soil may include 900&amp;nbsp;lb of earthworms, 2400&amp;nbsp;lb of fungi, 1500&amp;nbsp;lb of bacteria, 133&amp;nbsp;lb of protozoa and 890&amp;nbsp;lb of arthropods and algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pimentel, D.|display-authors=etal|year=1995|title=Environmental and economic costs of soil erosion and conservation benefits|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=267|pages=1117–22|bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1117P |doi = 10.1126/science.267.5201.1117|issue=24|pmid=17789193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small part of the organic matter consists of the living cells such as bacteria, molds, and actinomycetes that work to break down the dead organic matter. Were it not for the action of these micro-organisms, the entire carbon dioxide part of the atmosphere would be sequestered as organic matter in the soil.

Chemically, organic matter is classed as follows:

# Polysaccharides
## cellulose
## hemicellulose
## starch
## pectin
# Lignins
# Proteins

Most living things in soils, including plants, insects, bacteria, and fungi, are dependent on organic matter for nutrients and/or energy. Soils have organic compounds in varying degrees of decomposition which rate is dependent on the temperature, soil moisture, and aeration. Bacteria and fungi feed on the raw organic matter, which are fed upon by amoebas, which in turn are fed upon by nematodes and arthropods. Organic matter holds soils open, allowing the infiltration of air and water, and may hold as much as twice its weight in water. Many soils, including desert and rocky-gravel soils, have little or no organic matter. Soils that are all organic matter, such as [[peat]] ([[histosols]]), are infertile.&lt;ref name=Foth1984&gt;{{Cite book | last = Foth | first = Henry D. | year = 1984 | title = Fundamentals of soil science | page = 151 | isbn = 978-0471889267 | publisher = Wiley | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest stage of decomposition, the original organic material is often called raw organic matter. The final stage of decomposition is called humus.

In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

===Humus===
[[Humus]] refers to organic matter that has been decomposed by soil flora and fauna to the point where it is resistant to further breakdown. Humus usually constitutes only five percent of the soil or less by volume, but it is an essential source of nutrients and adds important textural qualities crucial to [[soil health]] and plant growth. Humus also hold bits of undecomposed organic matter which feed arthropods and worms which further improve the soil. The end product, humus, is soluble in water and forms a weak acid that can attack silicate minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilluly, Waters, Woodford|title=Principles of Geology|year=1975|edition=4th|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=USA|isbn=978-0716702696|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humus is a colloid with a high cation and anion exchange capacity that on a dry weight basis is many times greater than that of clay colloids. It also acts as a buffer, like clay, against changes in pH and soil moisture.

[[Humic acid]]s and [[fulvic acid]]s, which begin as raw organic matter, are important constituents of humus. After the death of plants and animals, microbes begin to feed on the residues, resulting finally in the formation of humus. With decomposition, there is a reduction of water-soluble constituents, [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As the residues break down, only stable molecules made of aromatic carbon rings, oxygen and hydrogen remain in the form of [[humin]], [[lignin]] and lignin complexes collectively called humus. While the structure of humus has few nutrients, it is able to attract and hold cation and anion nutrients by weak bonds that can be released into the soil solution in response to changes in soil pH.

Lignin is resistant to breakdown and accumulates within the soil. It also reacts with amino acids, which further increases its resistance to decomposition, including enzymatic decomposition by microbes. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es from plant matter have some resistance to decomposition and persist in soils for a while. Clay soils often have higher organic contents that persist longer than soils without clay as the organic molecules adhere to and are stabilised by the clay. Proteins normally decompose readily, but when bound to clay particles, they become more resistant to decomposition. Clay particles also absorb the enzymes exuded by microbes which would normally break down proteins. The addition of organic matter to clay soils can render that organic matter and any added nutrients inaccessible to plants and microbes for many years. High soil [[tannin]] ([[polyphenol]]) content can cause nitrogen to be sequestered in proteins or cause nitrogen immobilisation.&lt;ref name=Verkaik2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verkaik |first=Eric |last2=Jongkind |first2=Anne G. |last3=Berendse |first3=Frank |date=2006 |title=Short-term and long-term effects of tannins on nitrogen mineralization and litter decomposition in kauri (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl.) forests |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=287 |pages=337–45 |doi=10.1007/s11104-006-9081-8 |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/25615 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fierer2001&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fierer |first=N. |last2=Schimel |first2=Joshua P. |last3=Cates |first3=Rex G. |last4=Zou |first4=Jiping |title=Influence of balsam poplar tannin fractions on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in Alaskan taiga floodplain soils |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |date=2001 |volume=33 |pages=1827–39 |doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(01)00111-0 |issue=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humus formation is a process dependent on the amount of plant material added each year and the type of base soil. Both are affected by climate and the type of organisms present. Soils with humus can vary in nitrogen content but typically have 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;percent nitrogen. Raw organic matter, as a reserve of nitrogen and phosphorus, is a vital component affecting [[Fertile soil|soil fertility]].&lt;ref name="Foth1984"/&gt; Humus also absorbs water, and expands and shrinks between dry and wet states, increasing soil [[porosity]]. Humus is less stable than the soil's mineral constituents, as it is reduced by microbial decomposition, and over time its concentration diminshes without the addition of new organic matter. However, humus may persist over centuries if not millennia.

===Climatological influence===

==Horizons==
{{Main|Soil horizon}}

A horizontal layer of the soil, whose physical features, composition and age are distinct from those above and beneath, is referred to as a [[soil horizon]]. The naming of a horizon is based on the type of material of which it is composed. Those materials reflect the duration of specific processes of soil formation. They are labelled using a shorthand notation of letters and numbers&lt;ref name=Retallack1990&gt;{{Cite book| last = Retallack | first = G.

Some may have only one horizon.

The exposure of parent material to favourable conditions produces mineral soils that are marginally suitable for plant growth. That growth often results in the accumulation of organic residues. The accumulated organic layer called the [[forest floor|O horizon]] produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it. Organisms colonise and break down organic materials, making available nutrients upon which other plants and animals can live. After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.

==Classification==
{{main|Soil classification}}

Soil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil for a particular use. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications. The [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] (WRB)&lt;ref name=IUSS2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=IUSS Working Group WRB|title=World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2014.

====United States====
{{Main|USDA soil taxonomy#Orders}}

A taxonomy is an arrangement in a systematic manner; the  [[USDA soil taxonomy]] has six levels of classification. They are, from most general to specific: order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family and series. Soil properties that can be measured quantitatively are used in this classification system – they include: depth, moisture, temperature, texture, structure, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, clay mineralogy, organic matter content and salt content. There are 12 soil orders (the top hierarchical level) in soil taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html The Soil Orders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112143347/http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html |date=12 January 2010 }}, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=411–32}}  The names of the orders end with the suffix ''-sol''. The criteria for the different soil orders include properties that reflect major differences in the genesis of soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soil Survey Staff|title=Soil taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys. 2nd edition.

* [[Alfisol]] – soils with [[aluminium]] and [[iron]]. They have horizons of clay accumulation, and form where there is enough moisture and warmth for at least three months of plant growth. They constitute 10% of soils worldwide.
* [[Andisol]] – volcanic ash soils. They are young and very fertile. They cover 1% of the world's ice-free surface.
* [[Aridisol]] – dry soils forming under [[desert]] conditions which have fewer than 90 consecutive days of moisture during the growing season and are nonleached. They include nearly 12% of soils on Earth. Soil formation is slow, and accumulated organic matter is scarce. They may have subsurface zones of [[caliche]] or [[duripan]]. Many aridisols have well-developed Bt horizons showing clay movement from past periods of greater moisture.
* [[Entisol]] – recently formed soils that lack well-developed horizons. Commonly found on unconsolidated river and beach sediments of sand and clay or volcanic ash, some have an A horizon on top of bedrock. They are 18% of soils worldwide.
* [[Gelisol]] – permafrost soils with permafrost within two metres of the surface or gelic materials and permafrost within one metre. They constitute 9% of soils worldwide.
* [[Histosol]] – organic soils, formerly called bog soils, are 1% of soils worldwide.
* [[Inceptisol]] – young soils. They have subsurface horizon formation but show little eluviation and illuviation. They constitute 15% of soils worldwide.
* [[Mollisol]] – soft, deep, dark fertile soil formed in grasslands and some hardwood forests with very thick A horizons. They are 7% of soils worldwide.
* [[Oxisol]] – are heavily [[weathered]], are rich in iron and aluminum oxides ([[sesquioxides]]) or [[kaolin]] but low in [[silica]]. They have only trace nutrients due to heavy tropical rainfall and high temperatures and low [[Cation-exchange capacity|CEC]] of the remaining clays. They are 8% of soils worldwide.
* [[Spodosol]] – acid soils with organic colloid layer complexed with iron and aluminium leached from a layer above. They are typical soils of [[coniferous]] and [[deciduous forest]]s in cooler climates. They constitute 4% of soils worldwide.
* [[Ultisol]] – acid soils in the humid tropics and subtropics, which are depleted in [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] (important [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]]). They are highly [[weathered]], but not as weathered as Oxisols. They make up 8% of the soil worldwide.
* [[Vertisol]] – inverted soils. They are clay-rich and tend to swell when wet and shrink upon drying, often forming deep cracks into which surface layers can fall. They are difficult to farm or to construct roads and buildings due to their high expansion rate. They constitute 2% of soils worldwide.

"Soils of Mountains", which constitute the balance (11.6%), have a mixture of those listed above, or are classified as "Rugged Mountains" which have no soil.

The above soil orders in sequence of increasing degree of development are Entisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols, Mollisols, Alfisols, Spodosols, Ultisols, and Oxisols. Histosols and Vertisols may appear in any of the above at any time during their development.

The '''soil suborders''' within an order are differentiated on the basis of soil properties and horizons which depend on soil moisture and temperature. Forty-seven suborders are recognized in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The '''soil great group''' category is a subdivision of a suborder in which the kind and sequence of soil horizons distinguish one soil from another. About 185 great groups are recognized in the United States. Horizons marked by clay, iron, humus and hard pans and soil features such as the expansion-contraction of clays (that produce self-mixing provided by clay), temperature, and marked quantities of various salts are used as distinguishing features.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The great group categories are divided into three kinds of '''soil subgroups''': typic, intergrade and extragrade. A typic subgroup represents the basic or 'typical' concept of the great group to which the described subgroup belongs. An intergrade subgroup describes the properties that suggest how it grades towards (is similar to) soils of other soil great groups, suborders or orders. These properties are not developed or expressed well enough to cause the soil to be included within the great group towards which they grade, but suggest similarities. Extragrade features are aberrant properties which prevent that soil from being included in another soil classification. About 1,000 soil subgroups are defined in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

A '''soil family''' category is a group of soils within a subgroup and describes the physical and chemical properties which affect the response of soil to agricultural management and engineering applications. The principal characteristics used to differentiate soil families include texture, mineralogy, pH, permeability, structure, consistency, the locale's precipitation pattern, and soil temperature. For some soils the criteria also specify the percentage of silt, sand and coarse fragments such as gravel, cobbles and rocks. About 4,500 soil families are recognised in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=409–10}}

A family may contain several '''soil series''' which describe the physical location using the name of a prominent physical feature such as a river or town near where the soil sample was taken. An example would be Merrimac for the [[Merrimack River]] in New Hampshire. More than 14,000 soil series are recognised in the United States. This permits very specific descriptions of soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

A '''soil phase of series''', originally called 'soil type' describes the soil surface texture, slope, stoniness, saltiness, erosion, and other conditions.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

==Uses==
Soil is used in agriculture, where it serves as the anchor and primary nutrient base for plants; however, as demonstrated by [[hydroponics]], it is not essential to plant growth if the soil-contained nutrients can be dissolved in a solution. The types of soil and available moisture determine the species of plants that can be cultivated.

Soil material is also a critical component in the mining, construction and landscape development industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Soils for Landscape Development |author1=Leake, Simon|author2=Haege, Elke|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-0643109643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil serves as a foundation for most construction projects. The movement of massive volumes of soil can be involved in [[surface mining]], road building and dam construction. [[Earth sheltering]] is the architectural practice of using soil for external [[thermal mass]] against building walls. Many [[building material]]s are soil based.

Soil resources are critical to the environment, as well as to food and fibre production. Soil provides minerals and water to plants. Soil absorbs rainwater and releases it later, thus preventing floods and drought. Soil cleans water as it percolates through it. Soil is the habitat for many organisms: the major part of known and unknown [[biodiversity]] is in the soil, in the form of [[invertebrates]] ([[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]], [[millipede]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s, [[mite]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[Enchytraeidae|enchytraeids]], [[nematode]]s, [[protist]]s), [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], fungi and [[algae]]; and most organisms living above ground have part of them ([[plants]]) or spend part of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] ([[insects]]) below-ground. Above-ground and below-ground biodiversities are tightly interconnected,&lt;ref name="Ponge2003"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ponge| first = Jean-François| year = 2003| title = Humus forms in terrestrial ecosystems: a framework to biodiversity| journal = Soil Biology and Biochemistry| volume = 35| issue = 7| pages = 935–45| doi = 10.1016/S0038-0717(03)00149-4| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| format = PDF| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129153903/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| archivedate = 29 January 2016| df = dmy-all| citeseerx = 10.1.1.467.4937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Deyn2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Deyn |first=Gerlinde B. |last2=Van der Putten |first2=Wim H. |date=2005 |title=Linking aboveground and belowground diversity |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=20 |pages=625–33 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.08.009 |pmid=16701446 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; making soil protection of paramount importance for any restoration or conservation plan.

The biological component of soil is an extremely important carbon sink since about 57% of the biotic content is carbon. Even on desert crusts, cyanobacteria, lichens and mosses capture and sequester a significant amount of carbon by photosynthesis. Poor farming and grazing methods have degraded soils and released much of this sequestered carbon to the atmosphere. Restoring the world's soils could offset the effect of increases in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and slow global warming, while improving crop yields and reducing water needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Hansen, J. |display-authors = etal |journal=Open Atmospheric Science Journal|year=2008|volume= 2|issue = 1 |pages= 217–31 | title=Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?|arxiv = 0804.1126 |bibcode = 2008OASJ....2..217H |doi = 10.2174/1874282300802010217|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Waste management]] often has a soil component. [[Septic drain field]]s treat [[septic tank]] effluent using aerobic soil processes. [[Landfill]]s use soil for [[daily cover]]. Land application of waste water relies on soil biology to aerobically treat [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]].

Organic soils, especially [[peat]], serve as a significant fuel resource; but wide areas of peat production, such as [[sphagnum]] [[bog]]s, are now protected because of patrimonial interest.

[[Geophagy]] is the practice of eating soil-like substances. Both animals and human cultures occasionally consume soil for medicinal, recreational, or religious purposes.

Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].

[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore [[soil functions]] and values. Techniques include leaching, air sparging, chemical amendments, [[phytoremediation]], [[bioremediation]] and natural degradation.

[[Desertification]] is an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity. It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.

[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.

A serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.

Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as [[Sinkhole|sink hole]] formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = j. a. a. | title = Soil piping and stream channel initiation | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 602–10 | year = 1976 | doi = 10.1029/WR007i003p00602 | postscript = . | bibcode=1971WRR.....7..602J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Soil salination]] is the accumulation of free [[salt]]s to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. [[Surface irrigation|Irrigation]] of arid lands is especially problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | format = pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219070320/http://waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | archivedate = 19 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying [[water table]]. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the [[capillary fringe]] of saline groundwater.

==Reclamation==
Soils which contain high levels of particular clays, such as [[smectite]]s, are often very fertile. For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.

Many farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&amp;nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.

In 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.&lt;ref name="Water Management Institute2010"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all |author=International Water Management Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition. Adding organic matter (like [[ramial chipped wood]] for instance) to soil which is depleted in nutrients and too high in sand will boost its quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Provide for your garden's basic needs ... and the plants will take it from there|date=10 March 2011|journal=USA Weekend|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209012951/http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stark effect''' is the shifting and splitting of [[spectral line]]s of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external [[electric field]]. It is the electric-field analogue of the [[Zeeman effect]], where a spectral line is split into several components due to the presence of the [[magnetic field]]. Although initially coined for the static case, it is also used in the wider context to describe effect of time-dependent electric fields. In particular, the Stark effect is responsible for the [[Spectral_line#Pressure_broadening|pressure broadening]] (Stark broadening) of spectral lines by charged particles in [[Plasma_(physics)|plasma]]s. For majority of spectral lines, the Stark effect is either linear (proportional to the applied electric field) or quadratic with a high accuracy.

The Stark effect can be observed both for emission and absorption lines. The latter is sometimes called the '''inverse Stark effect''', but this term is no longer used in the modern literature.

==History==
The effect is named after the German physicist [[Johannes Stark]], who discovered it in 1913. It was independently discovered in the same year by the Italian physicist [[Antonino Lo Surdo]], and in Italy it is thus sometimes called the '''Stark–Lo Surdo effect'''. The discovery of this effect contributed importantly to the development of quantum theory and was rewarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for [[Johannes Stark]] in the year 1919.

Inspired by the magnetic [[Zeeman effect]], and especially by Lorentz's explanation of it, [[Woldemar Voigt]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Voigt, ''Ueber das Elektrische Analogon des Zeemaneffectes'' (On the electric analogue of the Zeeman effect), Annalen der Physik,  vol. '''309''',
pp. 197–208 (1901).&lt;/ref&gt; performed classical mechanical calculations of quasi-elastically bound electrons in an electric field. By using experimental indices of refraction he gave an estimate of the Stark splittings. This estimate was a few orders of magnitude too low. Not deterred by this prediction, Stark&lt;ref&gt;J. Stark, ''Beobachtungen über den Effekt des elektrischen Feldes auf Spektrallinien I. Quereffekt'' (Observations of the effect of the electric field on spectral lines I. Transverse effect), Annalen der Physik,  vol. '''43''', pp. 965–983 (1914). Published earlier (1913) in Sitzungsberichten der Kgl. Preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.&lt;/ref&gt; undertook measurements on excited states of the hydrogen atom and succeeded in observing splittings.

By the use of the Bohr–Sommerfeld ("old") quantum theory, [[Paul Sophus Epstein|Paul Epstein]]&lt;ref&gt;P. S. Epstein, ''Zur Theorie des Starkeffektes'', Annalen der Physik, vol. '''50''', pp. 489–520 (1916)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Schwarzschild]]&lt;ref&gt;K. Schwarzschild, Sitzungsberichten der Kgl. Preuss. Akad. d. Wiss. April 1916, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; were independently able to derive equations for the linear and quadratic Stark effect in [[hydrogen]]. Four years later, [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Hendrik Kramers]]&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Kramers, Roy. Danish Academy, ''Intensities of Spectral Lines. On the Application of the Quantum Theory to the Problem of Relative Intensities of the Components of the Fine Structure and of the Stark Effect of the Lines of the Hydrogen Spectrum'', p. 287 (1919);''Über den Einfluß eines elektrischen Feldes auf die Feinstruktur der Wasserstofflinien'' (On the influence of an electric field on the fine structure of hydrogen lines), Zeitschrift für Physik, vol. '''3''', pp. 199–223  (1920)&lt;/ref&gt; derived formulas for intensities of spectral transitions. Kramers also included the effect of [[fine structure]], which includes corrections for relativistic kinetic energy and coupling between electron spin and orbital motion. The first quantum mechanical treatment (in the framework of Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]]) was by Wolfgang Pauli.&lt;ref&gt;W. Pauli, ''Über dass Wasserstoffspektrum vom Standpunkt der neuen Quantenmechanik'' (On the hydrogen spectrum from the point of view of the new quantum mechanics). Zeitschrift für Physik, vol. '''36''' p. 336 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; Erwin Schrödinger discussed at length the Stark effect in his  third paper&lt;ref&gt;E. Schrödinger, ''Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem'', Annalen der Physik, vol. '''385''' Issue 13, 437–490 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; on quantum theory (in which he introduced his perturbation theory), once in the manner of the 1916 work of Epstein (but generalized from the old to the new quantum theory) and once by his (first-order) perturbation approach.
Finally, Epstein&lt;ref&gt;P. S. Epstein, ''The Stark Effect from the Point of View of Schroedinger's Quantum Theory'', Physical Review, vol '''28''', pp. 695–710 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; reconsidered the linear and quadratic Stark effect from the point of view of the new quantum theory. He derived equations for the line intensities which were a decided improvement over Kramers' results obtained by the old quantum theory.

While first-order perturbation effects for the Stark effect in hydrogen are in agreement for the Bohr–Sommerfeld  model and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] theory of the atom, higher-order effects are not.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths confirmed the correctness of the quantum theory over the Bohr model.

== Mechanism ==

===Overview===
An electric field pointing from left to right, for example, tends to pull nuclei to the right and electrons to the left. In another way of viewing it, if an electronic state has its electron disproportionately to the left, its energy is lowered, while if it has the electron disproportionately to the right, its energy is raised.

Other things being equal, the effect of the electric field is greater for outer [[electron shell]]s, because the electron is more distant from the nucleus, so it travels farther left and farther right.

The Stark effect can lead to splitting of [[degenerate energy level]]s. For example, in the [[Bohr model]], an electron has the same energy whether it is in the [[electron shell|2s]] state or any of the [[electron shell|2p]] states. However, in an electric field, there will be [[Orbital hybridisation|hybrid orbitals]] (also called [[quantum superposition]]s) of the 2s and 2p states where the electron tends to be to the left, which will acquire a lower energy, and other hybrid orbitals where the electron tends to be to the right, which will acquire a higher energy. Therefore, the formerly degenerate energy levels will split into slightly lower and slightly higher energy levels.

===Classical electrostatics===
The Stark effect originates from the interaction between a charge distribution (atom or molecule) and an external [[electric field]].  Before turning to quantum mechanics we describe the interaction
classically and consider a continuous charge distribution ρ('''r''').
If this charge distribution  is non-polarizable its interaction energy with an external [[Electrostatic#Electrostatic potential|electrostatic potential]] ''V''('''r''') is 
:&lt;math&gt; E_{\mathrm{int}} = \int \rho(\mathbf{r}) V(\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}^3&lt;/math&gt;.
If the electric field is of macroscopic origin and the charge distribution is microscopic, it is reasonable to assume that the electric field is uniform over the charge distribution. That is, ''V'' is given by a two-term [[Taylor expansion]],
:&lt;math&gt;
V(\mathbf{r}) = V(\mathbf{0}) - \sum_{i=1}^3 r_i F_i &lt;/math&gt;, with the electric field: &lt;math&gt;F_i \equiv  -\left. \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial r_i} \right)\right|_{\mathbf{0}}&lt;/math&gt;,
where we took the origin '''0''' somewhere within ρ.
Setting ''V''(0) as the zero energy, the interaction becomes
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{int}} = - \sum_{i=1}^3 F_i  \int \rho(\mathbf{r}) r_i d\mathbf{r} \equiv
- \sum_{i=1}^3 F_i  \mu_i = - \mathbf{F}\cdot \boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;.
Here we have introduced the [[dipole|dipole moment]]  '''μ''' of ρ as an integral over the charge distribution. In case ρ consists of ''N'' point charges ''q''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; this definition becomes a sum
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu} \equiv \sum_{j=1}^N  q_j \mathbf{r}_j&lt;/math&gt;.

===Perturbation theory===
Electric-field perturbation applied to a classical hydrogen atom produces a distortion of the electron orbit in a direction perpendicular to the applied field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J. C.|year=1987|title=The strange polarization of the classical atom|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=55|issue=10|pages=906–909|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/55/10/10.1119/1.14951|bibcode = 1987AmJPh..55..906S |doi = 10.1119/1.14951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Anchor|perpendicular2016-01-29}}This effect can be shown without perturbation theory using the relation between the angular momentum and the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biedenharn|first=L.

This approach can also lead to an ''exactly solvable'' approximate model Hamiltonian for an atom in a strong oscillatory field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biedenharn|first=L.

Turning now to quantum mechanics an atom or a molecule can be thought of as a collection of point charges (electrons and nuclei), so that the second definition of the dipole applies. The interaction of atom or molecule with a uniform external field is described by the operator
:&lt;math&gt; V_{\mathrm{int}} = - \mathbf{F}\cdot \boldsymbol{\mu}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This operator is used as a perturbation in first- and second-order [[perturbation theory]] to account for the first- and second-order Stark effect.

====First order====
Let the unperturbed atom or molecule be in a ''g''-fold degenerate state with orthonormal zeroth-order state functions &lt;math&gt; \psi^0_1, \ldots, \psi^0_g &lt;/math&gt;. (Non-degeneracy is the special case ''g'' = 1). According to perturbation theory the first-order energies are the eigenvalues of the ''g'' x ''g''  matrix with general element 
:&lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{int}})_{kl} = \langle \psi^0_k |  V_{\mathrm{int}} | \psi^0_l \rangle =
-\mathbf{F}\cdot \langle \psi^0_k | \boldsymbol{\mu} | \psi^0_l \rangle,
\qquad k,l=1,\ldots, g.
&lt;/math&gt;
If ''g'' = 1 (as is often the case for electronic states of molecules)  the first-order energy becomes proportional to the expectation (average) value of the dipole operator &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
E^{(1)} = -\mathbf{F}\cdot \langle \psi^0_1 | \boldsymbol{\mu} | \psi^0_1 \rangle =
-\mathbf{F}\cdot \langle  \boldsymbol{\mu} \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

Because a dipole moment is a [[Polar and axial vectors|polar vector]], the diagonal elements of the perturbation  matrix '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; vanish for systems with an [[parity (physics)|inversion center]] (such as atoms). Molecules with an inversion center in a non-degenerate electronic state do not have a (permanent) dipole and hence do not show a linear Stark effect.

In order to obtain a non-zero matrix '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; for systems with an inversion center it is necessary that some of the unperturbed functions &lt;math&gt; \psi^0_i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite parity (obtain plus and minus under inversion), because only functions of opposite parity give non-vanishing matrix elements. Degenerate zeroth-order states of opposite parity occur for excited hydrogen-like (one-electron) atoms or Rydberg states. Neglecting [[fine structure|fine-structure]] effects, such a state with the principal quantum number ''n'' is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-fold degenerate and
:&lt;math&gt;
n^2 = \sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1} (2 \ell + 1),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\ell &lt;/math&gt; is the azimuthal (angular momentum) quantum number. For instance, the excited ''n'' = 4 state contains the following &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; states,
:&lt;math&gt;
16 = 1 + 3 + 5 +7 \;\; \Longrightarrow\;\;  n=4\;\hbox{contains}\; s\oplus p\oplus d\oplus f.
&lt;/math&gt;
The one-electron states with even &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are even under parity, while those with odd &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are odd under parity. Hence hydrogen-like atoms with ''n''&gt;1 show first-order Stark effect.

The first-order Stark effect occurs in rotational transitions of [[Rotational spectroscopy#Classification of molecules based on rotational behavior|symmetric top molecules]] (but not for linear and asymmetric molecules). In first approximation a molecule may be seen as a rigid rotor. A symmetric top [[rigid rotor]] has the unperturbed eigenstates
:&lt;math&gt;
|JKM \rangle = (D^J_{MK})^* \quad\mathrm{with}\quad M,K= -J,-J+1,\dots,J
&lt;/math&gt;
with 2(2''J''+1)-fold degenerate energy for |K| &gt; 0 and (2''J''+1)-fold degenerate energy for K=0.
Here ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''MK''&lt;/sub&gt; is an element of the [[Wigner D-matrix]]. The first-order perturbation matrix  on basis of the unperturbed rigid rotor function is non-zero and can be diagonalized. This gives shifts and splittings
in  the rotational spectrum. Quantitative analysis of these Stark shift yields the permanent [[electric dipole moment]] of the symmetric top molecule.

====Second order====
As stated, the quadratic Stark effect is described by second-order perturbation theory.
The zeroth-order [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenproblem]]
:&lt;math&gt;
H^{(0)} \psi^0_k = E^{(0)}_k \psi^0_k, \quad k=0,1, \ldots, \quad E^{(0)}_0 &lt; E^{(0)}_1 \le E^{(0)}_2, \dots 
&lt;/math&gt;
is assumed to be solved. The perturbation theory gives
:&lt;math&gt;
E^{(2)}_k = \sum_{k^\prime \neq k} \frac{\langle \psi^0_k | V_\mathrm{int} | \psi^0_{k^\prime} \rangle \langle \psi^0_{k^\prime} | V_\mathrm{int} | \psi^0_k \rangle}{E^{(0)}_k - E^{(0)}_{k^\prime}} \equiv -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^3 \alpha_{ij} F_i F_j
&lt;/math&gt;
with the components of the [[polarizability|polarizability tensor]] α defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{ij} = -2\sum_{k^\prime \neq k} \frac{\langle \psi^0_k | \mu_i | \psi^0_{k^\prime} \rangle \langle \psi^0_{k^\prime} | \mu_j | \psi^0_k \rangle}{E^{(0)}_k - E^{(0)}_{k^\prime}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The energy ''E''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; gives the quadratic Stark effect.

Neglecting the [[hyperfine structure]] (which is often justified — unless extremely weak electric fields are considered), the polarizability tensor of atoms is isotropic,
:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{ij} \equiv \alpha_0 \delta_{ij} \Longrightarrow E^{(2)} = -\frac{1}{2} \alpha_0 F^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
For some molecules this expression is a reasonable approximation, too.

It is important to note that for the ground state &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt; is ''always'' positive, i.e., the quadratic Stark shift is always negative.

====Problems====
The perturbative treatment of the Stark effect has some problems. In the presence of an electric field, states of atoms and molecules that were previously bound ([[square-integrable]]), become formally (non-square-integrable) [[resonance]]s of finite width.
These resonances may decay in finite time via field ionization. For low lying states and not too strong fields the decay times are so long, however, that for all practical purposes the system can be regarded as bound. For highly excited states and/or very strong fields ionization may have to be accounted for. (See also the article on the [[Rydberg atom]]).

== Quantum-confined Stark effect ==
{{main article|Quantum-confined Stark effect}}
In a semiconductor heterostructure, where a small bandgap material is sandwiched between two layers of a larger bandgap material, the Stark effect can be dramatically enhanced by bound [[excitons]]. This is because the [[electron]] and [[Electron hole|hole]] which form the exciton are pulled in opposite directions by the applied electric field, but they remain confined in the smaller bandgap material, so the exciton is not merely pulled apart by the field. The quantum-confined Stark effect is widely used for semiconductor-based optical modulators, particularly for [[optical fiber]] communications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

==Content==

''The Genius of Birds'' highlights new findings and discoveries in the field of [[bird intelligence]]. The book explores birds as thinkers (contrary to the cliché "[[wikt:birdbrain|bird brain]]") in the context of observed behavior in the wild and brings to it the scientific findings from lab and field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ackerman |first=Jennifer |date=12 April 2016 |title=The Genius of Birds |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Press |page= |isbn=1594205213 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New research suggests that some birds, such as those in the family [[Corvidae#Intelligence|corvidae]], can rival primates and even [[human intelligence|humans]] in forms of [[intelligence]]. Much like humans, birds have [[Brain size|enormous brains]] relative to the rest of their bodies.

Ackerman highlights the complex social structures of avian society. They are capable of [[Abstraction|abstract thinking]], problem solving, recognizing faces, gift giving, sharing, grieving, and meaningful communication with humans. Ackerman goes in depth to highlight scientific studies that uncover behavior such as [[Bird_intelligence#Tool_use|tool usage]], speaking in regional accents, navigation, and [[theory of mind]].

==Reception==
The book is a [[New York Times Bestseller]],&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2703">'''Thin-film thickness monitors''', '''deposition rate controllers''', and so on, are a family of instruments used in high and [[ultra-high vacuum|ultra-high]] [[vacuum]] systems.  They can measure the thickness of a [[thin film]], not only after it has been made, but while it is still being [[Thin-film deposition|deposited]], and some can control either the final thickness of the film, the rate at which it is deposited, or both.  Not surprisingly, the devices which control some aspect of the process tend to be called controllers, and those that simply monitor the process tend to be called monitors.

Most such instruments use a [[quartz crystal microbalance]] as the sensor.  Optical measurements are sometimes used; this may be especially appropriate if the film being deposited is part of a [[Thin-film optics|thin film optical device]].

A thickness monitor measures how much material deposited on its sensor.  Most deposition processes are at least somewhat directional.  The sensor and the sample generally cannot be in the same direction from the deposition source (if they were, the one closer to the source would shadow the other), and may not even be at the same distance from it.  Therefore, the rate at which the material is deposited on the sensor may not equal the rate at which it is deposited on the sample.  The ratio of the two rates is sometimes called the "tooling factor".  For careful work, the tooling factor should be checked by measuring the amount of material deposited on some samples after the fact and comparing it to what the thickness monitor measured.  [[Fizeau interferometer]]s are often used to do this.  Many other techniques might be used, depending on the thickness and characteristics of the thin film, including [[profilometer|surface profilers]], [[ellipsometry]], [[dual polarisation interferometry]] and [[electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] of cross-sections of the sample.  Many thickness monitors and controllers allow tooling factors to be entered into the device before deposition begins.

The correct tooling factor can be calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;F_m = F_i \, \frac{T_m}{T_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial tooling factor, T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the film thickness indicated by the instrument, and T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the actual, independently measured thickness of the deposited film. If no tooling factor has been preset or used before, F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; equals 1.

'''Vacuum evaporation''' is the process of causing the [[pressure]] in a liquid-filled container to be reduced below the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid, causing the liquid to evaporate at a lower temperature than normal. Although the process can be applied to any type of liquid at any vapor pressure, it is generally used to describe the boiling of [[water]] by lowering the container's internal pressure below standard [[atmospheric pressure]] and causing the water to boil at [[room temperature]].

The vacuum evaporation treatment process consists of reducing the interior pressure of the evaporation chamber below atmospheric pressure. This reduces the boiling point of the liquid to be evaporated, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for heat in both the boiling and condensation processes. In addition, there are other technical advantages such as the ability to distill other liquids with high boiling points and avoiding the decomposition of substances that are sensitive to temperature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutiérrez|first1=Gemma|last2=Cambiella|first2=Ángel|last3=Benito|first3=José M.|last4=Pazos|first4=Carmen|last5=Coca|first5=José|title=The effect of additives on the treatment of oil-in-water emulsions by vacuum evaporation|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|date=June 2007|volume=144|issue=3|pages=649–654|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.01.090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
When the process is applied to [[food]] and the water is [[evaporate]]d and removed, the food can be stored for long periods of time without spoiling. It is also used when boiling a substance at normal temperatures would chemically change the consistency of the product, such as [[egg whites]] [[coagulating]] when attempting to [[dehydrate]] the [[albumen]] into a powder.

This process was invented by [[Henri Nestlé]] in 1866, of [[Nestlé]] Chocolate fame,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  although the [[Shakers]] were already using a [[vacuum pan]] earlier than that (see [[condensed milk]]).

This process is used industrially to make such food products as [[evaporated milk]] for [[milk chocolate]], and [[tomato paste]] for [[ketchup]].

[[File:Vacuum evaporation plant.jpg|thumb|Vacuum evaporation plant]]
[[File:00-vacuum-pan-sugar-factory.JPG|thumb|right|vacuum pans in a beet sugar factory]]In the sugar industry vacuum evaporation is used in the [[crystallization]] of [[sucrose]] solutions. Traditionally, this process was performed in batch mode, but nowadays continuous vacuum pans are available.&lt;ref&gt;BMA Gruppe. [http://www.bma-worldwide.com/products/sugar-and-sweeteners/vacuum-pans-batch-and-continuous-types-vkt.html Article on continuous vacuum pans.] Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wastewater treatment==
Vacuum evaporators are used in a wide range of industrial sectors to treat [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;Condorchem Envitech. [http://condorchem.com/en/view/50-Vacuum-evaporators "Vacuum evaporators"] as a technology for industrial water-based liquid waste minimization and treatment. Retrieved 27 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a clean, safe and very versatile technology having low management costs, which in most cases serves as a zero-discharge treatment system.

==Thin film deposition==
Vacuum evaporation is also a form of [[physical vapor deposition]] used in the [[semiconductor]], [[microelectronics]], and [[optic]]al industries and in this context is a process of depositing [[thin films]] of material onto surfaces.  Such a technique consists of pumping a [[vacuum chamber]] to pressures of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]] and heating a material to produce a [[flux]] of [[vapor]] in order to deposit the material onto a surface. The material to be vaporized is typically heated until its [[vapor pressure]] is high enough to produce a flux of several [[Angstroms]] per second by using an [[electrical]]ly [[resistive]] heater or bombardment by a high [[voltage]] beam.

{{Quantum field theory|cTopic=Topics}}

In [[quantum field theory]], the '''quantum vacuum state''' (also called the '''quantum vacuum''' or '''vacuum state''') is the [[quantum state]] with the lowest possible [[energy]]. Generally, it contains no physical particles. '''Zero-point field''' is sometimes used as a synonym for the vacuum state of an individual quantized field.

According to present-day understanding of what is called the vacuum state or the quantum vacuum, it is "by no means a simple empty space".&lt;ref name=Lambrecht&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to quantum mechanics, the vacuum state is not truly empty but instead contains fleeting electromagnetic waves and particles that pop into and out of existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/pnu/1996/split/pnu300-3.htm AIP Physics News Update,1996]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.aps.org/story/v2/st28 Physical Review Focus Dec. 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dittrich&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[QED vacuum]] of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (or QED) was the first vacuum of [[quantum field theory]] to be developed. QED originated in the 1930s, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was reformulated by [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga|Tomonaga]] and [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], who jointly received the Nobel prize for this work in 1965.&lt;ref name=history&gt;

For an historical discussion, see for example {{cite book |title=Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences |volume=1 |editor=Ari Ben-Menaḥem |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tUrarQYhKMC&amp;pg=PA4892 |chapter=Quantum electrodynamics (QED) |pages=4892 ''ff'' |isbn=3-540-68831-5 |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |edition=5th}} For the Nobel prize details and the Nobel lectures by these authors see {{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1965 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/ |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2012-02-06}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Today the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]s and the [[weak interaction]]s are unified in the theory of the [[electroweak interaction]].

The [[Standard Model]] is a generalization of the QED work to include all the known [[elementary particle]]s and their interactions (except gravity). [[Quantum chromodynamics]] is the portion of the Standard Model that deals with [[strong interaction]]s, and [[QCD vacuum]] is the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics. It is the object of study in the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]], and is related to the so-called ''vacuum structure of [[strong interactions]]''.&lt;ref name= Letessier&gt;{{cite book |title=Hadrons and Quark-Gluon Plasma |author=Jean Letessier |author2=Johann Rafelski |page=37 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSnFPyQaSTsC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;vq=Qgp+state&amp;dq=weinberg+%22symmetry+%22 |isbn=0-521-38536-9 |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-zero expectation value==
{{main|Vacuum expectation value}}
[[File:Vacuum fluctuations revealed through spontaneous parametric down-conversion.ogv|thumb|right|350px| The video of an experiment showing [[vacuum fluctuations]] (in the red ring) amplified by [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]]. ]]

If the quantum field theory can be accurately described through [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], then the properties of the vacuum are analogous to the properties of the [[ground state]] of a quantum mechanical [[harmonic oscillator]], or more accurately, the [[ground state]] of a [[measurement problem]]. In this case the [[vacuum expectation value]] (VEV) of any [[quantum field theory#Field operators|field operator]] vanishes. For quantum field theories in which perturbation theory breaks down at low energies (for example, [[Quantum chromodynamics]] or the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconductivity]]) field operators may have non-vanishing [[vacuum expectation value]]s called [[condensate (quantum field theory)|condensate]]s. In the [[Standard Model]], the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the [[Higgs field]], arising from [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], is the mechanism by which the other fields in the theory acquire mass.

==Energy==
{{main|Vacuum energy}}
In many situations, the vacuum state can be defined to have zero energy, although the actual situation is considerably more subtle. The vacuum state is associated with a [[zero-point energy]], and this zero-point energy has measurable effects. In the laboratory, it may be detected as the [[Casimir effect]]. In [[physical cosmology]], the energy of the cosmological vacuum appears as the [[cosmological constant]]. In fact, the energy of a cubic centimeter of empty space has been calculated figuratively to be one trillionth of an [[erg]] (or 0.6 eV).&lt;ref&gt;Sean Carroll, Sr Research Associate - Physics, [[California Institute of Technology]], June 22, 2006 [[C-SPAN]] broadcast of Cosmology at Yearly Kos Science Panel, Part 1&lt;/ref&gt; An outstanding requirement imposed on a potential [[Theory of Everything]] is that the energy of the quantum vacuum state must explain the physically observed cosmological constant.

==Symmetry==
For a [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] field theory, the vacuum is [[Poincaré symmetry|Poincaré invariant]], which follows from
[[Wightman axioms]] but can be also proved directly without these axioms.&lt;ref name=proof-vac&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bednorz|first=Adam|title=Relativistic invariance of the vacuum|journal=The European Physical Journal C|date=November 2013|volume=73|issue=12|pages=2654|doi=10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2654-9|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2654-9|accessdate=26 November 2013|arxiv = 1209.0209 |bibcode = 2013EPJC...73.2654B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré invariance implies that only [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] combinations of field operators have non-vanishing [[vacuum expectation value|VEV's]]. The [[vacuum expectation value|VEV]] may break some of the [[internal symmetries]] of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of the field theory. In this case the vacuum has less symmetry than the theory allows, and one says that ''[[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]'' has occurred. See [[Higgs mechanism]], [[standard model]].

==Electrical permittivity==
In principle, quantum corrections to Maxwell's equations can cause the experimental electrical permittivity ε of the vacuum state to deviate from the defined scalar value ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[electric constant]].&lt;ref name=Delphenich&gt;{{cite arXiv|title=Nonlinear Electrodynamics and QED |author=David Delphenich |date=2006 |eprint=hep-th/0610088}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theoretical developments are described, for example, in Dittrich and Gies.&lt;ref name=Dittrich/&gt;
In particular, the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] predicts that the [[QED vacuum]] should exhibit [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear effects]] that will make it behave like a [[birefringent]] material with ε slightly greater than ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for extremely strong electric fields.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, James J. and B. P. Nigam, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v135/i5B/pB1279_1 ''Birefringence of the vacuum''], ''Physical Review'' vol. '''135''', p. B1279-B1280 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mourou&gt;Mourou, G.

==Virtual particles==
{{main|Virtual particle}}
The presence of virtual particles can be rigorously based upon the [[commutator|non-commutation]] of the [[Quantization of the electromagnetic field|quantized electromagnetic field]]s. Non-commutation means that although the [[average]] values of the fields vanish in a quantum vacuum, their [[variance|variances]] do not.&lt;ref name=commutator&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s" refers to the variance of the field strength in the minimal energy state,&lt;ref name=Klyshko&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes attempted to provide an intuitive picture of virtual particles, or variances, based upon the Heisenberg [[Uncertainty principle#Energy.E2.80.93time uncertainty principle|energy-time uncertainty principle]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta t \ge \hbar \ , &lt;/math&gt;
(with ''ΔE'' and ''Δt'' being the [[energy]] and [[time]] variations respectively; ''ΔE'' is the accuracy in the measurement of energy and ''Δt'' is the time taken in the measurement, and {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[Reduced Planck constant]]) arguing along the lines that the short lifetime of virtual particles allows the "borrowing" of large energies from the vacuum and thus permits particle generation for short times.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt; Although the phenomenon of virtual particles is accepted, this interpretation of the energy-time uncertainty relation is not universal.&lt;ref name=Allday/&gt;&lt;ref name=King/&gt; One issue is the use of an uncertainty relation limiting measurement accuracy as though a time uncertainty ''Δt'' determines a "budget" for borrowing energy ''ΔE''. Another issue is the meaning of "time" in this relation, because energy and time (unlike position {{math|''q''}} and momentum {{math|''p''}}, for example) do not satisfy a [[canonical commutation relation]] (such as {{math|[''q'', ''p''] {{=}} i&amp;thinsp;''ħ''}}).&lt;ref name=commutation/&gt; Various schemes have been advanced to construct an observable that has some kind of time interpretation, and yet does satisfy a canonical commutation relation with energy.&lt;ref name=Busch0/&gt;&lt;ref name=Busch/&gt; The very many approaches to the energy-time uncertainty principle are a long and continuing subject.&lt;ref name=Busch/&gt;

==Physical nature of the quantum vacuum==
According to Astrid Lambrecht (2002): "When one empties out a space of all matter and lowers the temperature to absolute zero, one produces in a ''Gedankenexperiment'' [mental experiment] the quantum vacuum state."&lt;ref name=Lambrecht/&gt; According to [[Ralph Fowler|Fowler]] &amp; [[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim]] (1939/1965), the [[third law of thermodynamics]] may be precisely enunciated as follows:
&lt;Blockquote&gt;''It is impossible by any procedure, no matter how idealized, to reduce any assembly to the absolute zero in a finite number of operations.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Fowler|Fowler, R.]], [[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1965). ''Statistical Thermodynamics. A Version of Statistical Mechanics for Students of Physics and Chemistry'', reprinted with corrections, Cambridge University Press, London, page 224.&lt;/ref&gt; (See also.&lt;ref&gt;Partington, J.R. (1949). ''An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry'', volume 1, ''Fundamental Principles. The Properties of Gases'', Longmans, Green and Co., London, page 220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, J. (1971). The Third Law of Thermodynamics, Chapter 6 in ''Thermodynamics'', volume 1, ed. W. Jost, of H. Eyring, D. Henderson, W. Jost, ''Physical Chemistry. An Advanced Treatise'', Academic Press, New York, page 477.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, New York, {{ISBN|0-88318-797-3}}, page 342.&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;/Blockquote&gt;

Photon-photon interaction can occur only through interaction with the vacuum state of some other field, for example through the Dirac electron-positron vacuum field; this is associated with the concept of [[vacuum polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;Jauch, J.M., Rohrlich, F. (1955/1980). ''The Theory of Photons and Electrons. The Relativistic Quantum Field Theory of Charged Particles with Spin One-half'', second expanded edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, {{ISBN|0-387-07295-0}}, pages 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter W. Milonni|Milonni]] (1994): "... ''all quantum fields have zero-point energies and vacuum fluctuations.''"&lt;ref&gt;Milonni, P.W. (1994). ''The Quantum Vacuum. An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics'', Academic Press, Inc., Boston, {{ISBN|0-12-498080-5}}, page xv.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there is a component of the quantum vacuum respectively for each component field (considered in the conceptual absence of the other fields), such as the electromagnetic field, the Dirac electron-positron field, and so on. According to Milonni (1994), some of the effects attributed to the [[QED vacuum|vacuum electromagnetic field]] can have several physical interpretations, some more conventional than others. The [[Casimir effect|Casimir attraction]] between uncharged conductive plates is often proposed as an example of an effect of the vacuum electromagnetic field. Schwinger, DeRaad, and Milton (1978) are cited by Milonni (1994) as validly, though unconventionally, explaining the Casimir effect with a model in which "the vacuum is regarded as truly a state with all physical properties equal to zero."&lt;ref&gt;Milonni, P.W. (1994). ''The Quantum Vacuum. An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics'', Academic Press, Inc., Boston, {{ISBN|0-12-498080-5}}, page 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwinger | first1 = J. | last2 = DeRaad | first2 = L.L. | last3 = Milton | first3 = K.A. | year = 1978 | title = Casimir effect in dielectrics | url = | journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi=10.1016/0003-4916(78)90172-0| bibcode = 1978AnPhy.115....1S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the observed phenomena are explained as the effects of the electron motions on the electromagnetic field, called the source field effect. Milonni writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The basic idea here will be that the Casimir force may be derived from the source fields alone even in completely conventional QED, ... Milonni provides detailed argument that the measurable physical effects usually attributed to the vacuum electromagnetic field cannot be explained by that field alone, but require in addition a contribution from the self-energy of the electrons, or their radiation reaction. He writes: "The radiation reaction and the vacuum fields are two aspects of the same thing when it comes to physical interpretations of various QED processes including the [[Lamb shift]], [[van der Waals forces]], and Casimir effects.&lt;ref&gt;Milonni, P.W. (1994). ''The Quantum Vacuum. An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics'', Academic Press, Inc., Boston, {{ISBN|0-12-498080-5}}, page 418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

This point of view is also stated by Jaffe (2005): "The Casimir force can be calculated without reference to vacuum fluctuations, and like all other observable effects in QED, it vanishes as the fine structure constant, {{math|''α''}}, goes to zero."&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, R.L. (2005). Casimir effect and the quantum vacuum, ''Phys. Rev. D'' '''72''': 021301(R), http://1–5.cua.mit.edu/8.422_s07/jaffe2005_casimir.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notations==
The vacuum state is written as &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The [[vacuum expectation value]] (see also [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|Expectation value]]) of any field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; should be written as &lt;math&gt;\langle0|\phi|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5340">The '''Wigner effect''' (named for its discoverer, [[Eugene Wigner]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1707653 | title = Theoretical Physics in the Metallurgical Laboratory of Chicago | year = 1946 | last1 = Wigner | first1 = E. P. | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 857–863|bibcode = 1946JAP....17..857W }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''discomposition effect''' or '''Wigner's Disease''',&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard; (1995); "Dark Sun: The Making Of The Hydrogen Bomb"; Simon &amp; Schuster; pg 277.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[dislocation]] of [[atom]]s in a solid caused by [[neutron radiation]]. 

Any solid can display the Wigner effect. The effect is of most concern in [[neutron moderator]]s, such as [[graphite]], intended to reduce the speed of [[Neutron temperature#Fast|fast neutrons]], thereby turning them into [[Neutron temperature|thermal neutrons]] capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction involving [[uranium-235]].

== Explanation ==
To create the Wigner effect, [[neutron]]s that collide with the atoms in a [[crystal structure]] must have enough [[energy]] to displace them from the lattice. This amount ([[threshold displacement energy]]) is approximately 25 [[Electronvolt|eV]]. A neutron's energy can vary widely, but it is not uncommon to have energies up to and exceeding 10 MeV (10,000,000 eV) in the centre of a [[nuclear reactor]]. A neutron with a significant amount of energy will create a [[Collision cascade|displacement cascade]] in a matrix via [[elastic collision]]s. For example, a 1 MeV neutron striking [[graphite]] will create 900 displacements; not all displacements will create defects, because some of the struck atoms will find and fill the vacancies that were either small pre-existing voids or vacancies newly formed by the other struck atoms.

The atoms that do not find a [[vacancy defect|vacancy]] come to rest in non-ideal locations; that is, not along the symmetrical lines of the lattice. These atoms are referred to as [[interstitial defect|interstitial atoms]], or simply interstitials. An interstitial atom and its associated vacancy are known as a [[Frenkel defect]]. Because these atoms are not in the ideal location, they have an energy associated with them, much as a ball at the top of a hill has [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential energy]]. This energy is referred to as [[Wigner energy]]. When a large number of [[interstitial defect|interstitials]] have accumulated, they pose a risk of releasing all of their energy suddenly, creating a rapid, very great increase in temperature. Sudden, unplanned increases in temperature can present a large risk for certain types of nuclear reactors with low operating temperatures; one such was the indirect cause of the [[Windscale fire]]. Accumulation of energy in irradiated graphite has been recorded as high as 2.7 kJ/g, but is typically much lower than this.&lt;ref&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency. [http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1521_web.pdf Characterization, Treatment and Conditioning of Radioactive Graphite from Decommissioning of Nuclear Reactors] (September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Graphite, having a heat capacity of 0.720 J/g°C, could see a sudden increase in temperature of about 3750&amp;nbsp;°C (6780&amp;nbsp;°F).

Despite some reports,&lt;ref&gt;Workshop on Short-Term Health Effects of Reactor Accidents: Chernobyl, August 8–9, 1986
V.P. Bond and E.P. Cronkite, Editors　[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/6905797-IIYHeP/6905797.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Wigner energy buildup had nothing to do with the cause of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]: this reactor, like all contemporary power reactors, operated at a high enough temperature to allow the displaced graphite structure to realign itself before any potential energy could be stored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/chernobyl-meltdown-no-graphite-us-nuclear-reactors-2016-4&lt;/ref&gt; Wigner energy may have played some part following the [[prompt criticality|prompt critical]] neutron spike, when the accident entered the graphite fire phase of events.

== Dissipation of Wigner energy ==
A buildup of Wigner energy can be relieved by heating the material. This process is known as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. In graphite this occurs at 250&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/w/wigner-energy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intimate Frenkel pairs ==
In 2003, it was postulated that Wigner energy can be stored by the formation of metastable defect structures in graphite. Notably, the large energy release observed at 200–250&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] has been described in terms of a metastable interstitial-vacancy pair.&lt;ref&gt;Metastable Frenkel Pair Defect in Graphite: Source of Wigner Energy? C. P. Ewels, R. H. Telling, A. A. El-Barbary, M. I. Heggie, and P. R. Briddon Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 025505 – Published 10 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The interstitial atom becomes trapped on the lip of the vacancy, and there is a barrier for it to recombine to give perfect graphite.

The most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world. In Canada and northwest China, lightning operates as the major source of ignition. In other parts of the world, human involvement is a major contributor. In Africa, Central America, Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and land-conversion burning. In China and in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhihua|last2=Yang|first2=Jian|last3=Chang|first3=Yu|last4=Weisberg|first4=Peter J.|last5=He|first5=Hong S.|date=June 2012|title=Spatial patterns and drivers of fire occurrence and its future trend under climate change in a boreal forest of Northeast China|journal=Global Change Biology|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=2041–2056|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02649.x|issn=1354-1013|bibcode=2012GCBio..18.2041L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Rigo|first=Daniele|last2=Libertà|first2=Giorgio|last3=Houston Durrant|first3=Tracy|last4=Artés Vivancos|first4=Tomàs|last5=San-Miguel-Ayanz|first5=Jesús|title=Forest fire danger extremes in Europe under climate change: variability and uncertainty|page=71|date=2017|publisher=Publication Office of the European Union|location=Luxembourg|isbn=978-92-79-77046-3|doi=10.2760/13180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Australia, the source of wildfires can be traced both to lightning strikes and to human activities (such as machinery sparks, cast-away cigarette butts, or [[arson]]).&lt;ref name="Krock"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|title=The World on Fire|last=Krock|first=Lexi|date=June 2002|publisher=NOVA online – Public Broadcasting System (PBS)|accessdate=13 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027041902/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|archivedate=27 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balch|first=Jennifer K.|last2=Bradley|first2=Bethany A.|last3=Abatzoglou|first3=John T.|last4=Nagy|first4=R.

The spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present, its vertical arrangement and moisture content, and weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., iv"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., iv.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by [[topography]], as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth. Overall, fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows: 
* '''Ground''' fires are fed by subterranean roots, [[forest floor|duff]] and other buried [[organic matter]]. This fuel type is especially susceptible to ignition due to spotting. Ground fires typically burn by smoldering, and can burn slowly for days to months, such as [[Peat#Peat Fires|peat fires]] in [[Kalimantan]] and Eastern [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], which resulted from a [[Mega Rice Project (Kalimantan)|riceland creation project]] that unintentionally drained and dried the peat.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 9, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | title = Asian peat fires add to warming | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News | last = Rincon | first = Paul | date = 9 March 2005 | accessdate = 9 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219064000/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | archivedate = 19 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Crawling''' or '''surface''' fires are fueled by low-lying vegetation on the [[forest floor]] such as leaf and timber litter, debris, grass, and low-lying shrubbery.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al'' ., iv, 10, 14&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of fire often burns at a relatively lower temperature than crown fires (less than {{convert|400|C|F}}) and may spread at slow rate, though steep slopes and wind can accelerate the rate of spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fire on earth : an introduction|last=C.|first=Scott, Andrew|others=Bowman, D.

* '''Ladder''' fires consume material between low-level vegetation and tree canopies, such as small trees, downed logs, and [[vine]]s. [[Kudzu]], [[Old World climbing fern]], and other [[invasive plant]]s that scale trees may also encourage ladder fires.&lt;ref name="FireInitiative"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tncfire.org/crosscutting_fandi.htm | title = Global Fire Initiative: Fire and Invasives | publisher = The Nature Conservancy | accessdate = 3 December 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090412054533/http://www.tncfire.org/crosscutting_fandi.htm | archivedate = 12 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Crown''', '''canopy''', or '''aerial''' fires burn suspended material at the canopy level, such as tall trees, vines, and mosses. The ignition of a crown fire, termed ''crowning'', is dependent on the density of the suspended material, canopy height, canopy continuity, sufficient surface and ladder fires, vegetation moisture content, and weather conditions during the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., iv, 8, 11, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Stand-replacing fires lit by humans can spread into the [[Amazon rain forest]], damaging ecosystems not particularly suited for heat or arid conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2010|title=Global Commodities Boom Fuels New Assault on Amazon|last=Butler|first=Rhett|publisher=Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies|accessdate=9 July 2009|date=19 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411124535/http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2010|archivedate=11 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildfires occur when all of the necessary elements of a [[fire triangle]] come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as [[vegetation]], that is subjected to sufficient heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are required to evaporate any water within the material and heat the material to its [[fire point]].&lt;ref name = FireBehavior/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIFC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|title=The Science of Wildland fire|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|accessdate=21 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105175208/http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|archivedate=5 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater [[humidity]], and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., 12"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants continuously lose water by [[evapotranspiration]], but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | title = Ashes cover areas hit by Southern Calif. fires | agency = Associated Press | publisher = MSNBC | date = 15 November 2008 | accessdate = 4 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081209033149/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | archivedate = 9 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.&lt;ref name=Structure&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | title = Influence of Forest Structure on Wildfire Behavior and the Severity of Its Effects | date = November 2003 | format = PDF | publisher = US Forest Service | accessdate = 19 November 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217125731/http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | archivedate = 17 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | title = Prepare for a Wildfire | publisher = Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) | accessdate = 1 December 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081029025706/https://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | archivedate = 29 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wildfire ''front'' is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the [[smolder]]ing transition between unburned and burned material.&lt;ref&gt;''Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through [[convection]] and [[thermal radiation]]. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of {{convert|100|C|F}}. Next, the [[pyrolysis]] of wood at {{convert|230|C|F|sigfig=2}} releases flammable gases.

Wildfire's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry, hot periods.&lt;ref name=NOVA /&gt; Such places include the vegetated areas of Australia and [[Southeast Asia]], the [[veld]] in southern Africa, the [[fynbos]] in the Western Cape of South Africa, the forested areas of the United States and Canada, and the [[Mediterranean Basin]].

High-severity wildfire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat (also called “snag forest habitat”), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plant and animal species in most types of North American forests evolved with fire, and many of these species depend on wildfires, and particularly high-severity fires, to reproduce and grow. Fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil, the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds, and the snags (dead trees) and early successional forests created by high-severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Early successional forests created by high-severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donato|first=Daniel C.|last2=Fontaine|first2=Joseph B.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Although some ecosystems rely on naturally occurring fires to regulate growth, some ecosystems suffer from too much fire, such as the [[chaparral]] in [[southern California]] and lower-elevation deserts in the American Southwest. The increased fire frequency in these ordinarily fire-dependent areas has upset natural cycles, damaged native plant communities, and encouraged the growth of non-native weeds.&lt;ref&gt;''Interagency Strategy for the Implementation of the Federal Wildland Fire Policy'', 3, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.werc.usgs.gov/seki/pdfs/Future%20of%20California%20Floristics%20and%20Systematics%20Wildfire%20Th.pdf | format = PDF | title = Future of California floristics and systematics: wildfire threats to the California flora | author = Keeley, J.E. | journal = Madrono | volume = 42 | pages = 175–179 | date = 1995 | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090507033351/http://www.werc.usgs.gov/seki/pdfs/Future%20of%20California%20Floristics%20and%20Systematics%20Wildfire%20Th.pdf | archivedate = 7 May 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Zedler | first = P.H. | title = Fire frequency in southern California shrublands: biological effects and management options | date = 1995 | booktitle = Brushfires in California wildlands: ecology and resource management | editor = Keeley, J.E. | editor2 = Scott, T. | pages = 101–112 | place = Fairfield, WA | publisher = International Association of Wildland Fire}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Invasive species]], such as ''[[Lygodium microphyllum]]'' and ''[[Bromus tectorum]]'', can grow rapidly in areas that were damaged by fires.

{{Main|Fire adaptations}}
Plants in wildfire-prone [[ecosystems]] often survive through adaptations to their local [[fire regime]]. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate [[competition]]. For example, plants of the genus ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard [[sclerophyll]] leaves to resist heat and drought, ensuring their dominance over less fire-tolerant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | title=Section Three: Problems, Cares, Economics, and Species | work=The Eucalyptus of California | first=Robert L. | last=Santos | publisher=California State University | date=1997 | accessdate=26 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602175115/http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | archivedate=2 June 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fire.

Wildfires during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times. Surface fires driven by dry seasons{{clarify|does this mean annual dry seasons or erratic droughts?|date=October 2015}} are evident in Devonian and Carboniferous [[progymnosperm]] forests.  [[Lepidodendron]] forests dating to the Carboniferous period have charred peaks, evidence of crown fires. In Jurassic [[gymnosperm]] forests, there is evidence of high frequency, light surface fires.&lt;ref name="Pausas 594" /&gt; The increase of fire activity in the late [[Tertiary]]&lt;ref name="cenozoic-division"&gt;Historically, the [[Cenozoic]] has been divided up into the [[Quaternary]] and [[Tertiary]] sub-eras, as well as the [[Neogene]] and [[Paleogene]] periods.

The human use of fire for agricultural and hunting purposes during the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] ages altered the preexisting landscapes and fire regimes. Woodlands were gradually replaced by smaller vegetation that facilitated travel, hunting, seed-gathering and planting.&lt;ref&gt;Pausas and Keeley, 597&lt;/ref&gt; In recorded human history, minor allusions to wildfires were mentioned in the [[Bible]] and by classical writers such as [[Homer]]. However, while ancient Hebrew, Greek, and Roman writers were aware of fires, they were not very interested in the uncultivated lands where wildfires occurred.&lt;ref name=RackhamFire&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/OALS/ALN/aln54/rackham.html#hist|title=Fire in the European Mediterranean: History|last=Rackham|first=Oliver|authorlink=Oliver Rackham|accessdate=17 July 2009|journal=AridLands Newsletter|volume=54|date=November–December 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011110940/http://ag.arizona.edu/OALS/ALN/aln54/rackham.html#hist|archivedate=11 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RackhamHist&gt;Rackham, 229–230&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires were used in battles throughout human history as [[early thermal weapons]]. From the [[Middle ages]], accounts were written of [[occupational burning]] as well as customs and laws that governed the use of fire. In Germany, regular burning was documented in 1290 in the [[Odenwald]] and in 1344 in the [[Black Forest]].&lt;ref name="Goldammer" /&gt; In the 14th century [[Sardinia]], firebreaks were used for wildfire protection.

Scottish botanist [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]] noted the native use of fire for tobacco cultivation, to encourage deer into smaller areas for hunting purposes, and to improve foraging for honey and grasshoppers.

Wildfires typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought. An increase in fire-related [[debris flow]] in [[alluvial fan]]s of northeastern [[Yellowstone National Park]] was linked to the period between AD 1050 and 1200, coinciding with the [[Medieval Warm Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=G.A. |last2=Wells |first2=S.G.|last3=Jull|first3=A.J.T.|date=1995|title=Fire and alluvial chronology in Yellowstone National Park: Climatic and intrinsic controls on Holocene geomorphic processes|journal=GSA Bulletin|issue=10|pages=1211–1230 |doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107&lt;1211:FAACIY&gt;2.3.CO;2 |volume= 107 |bibcode = 1995GSAB..107.1211M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human influence caused an increase in fire frequency. [[Dendrochronological]] fire scar data and charcoal layer data in [[Finland]] suggests that, while many fires occurred during severe drought conditions, an increase in the number of fires during 850 BC and 1660 AD can be attributed to human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Pitkänen, ''et al.'', 15–16 and 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal evidence from the Americas suggested a general decrease in wildfires between 1 AD and 1750 compared to previous years. However, a period of increased fire frequency between 1750 and 1870 was suggested by charcoal data from North America and Asia, attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices. This period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th century, linked to the expansion of agriculture, increased livestock grazing, and fire prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n10/full/ngeo313.html |title=Climate and human influences on global biomass burning over the past two millennia |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |pages=697–702 |date=2008 |doi=10.1038/ngeo313 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..697M |author=J.

According to a paper published in [[Science (journal)|Science]], the number of natural and human-caused fires decreased by 24.3% between 1998 and 2015. Researchers explain this a transition from [[nomadism]] to settled lifestyle and intensification of [[agriculture]] that lead to a drop in the use of fire for land clearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90493|title= Researchers Detect a Global Drop in Fires|author= &lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date= June 30, 2017|website= [[NASA Earth Observatory]]|publisher= |access-date= July 4, 2017|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171208175626/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90493|archivedate= 8 December 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Andela|first1= N.|last2= Morton|first2= D.C.|display-authors= etal|date= June 30, 2017|title= A human-driven decline in global burned area|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1356|journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume= 356|issue= 6345|pages= 1356–1362|doi= 10.1126/science.aal4108|pmid= 28663495|pmc= 6047075|access-date= July 4, 2017|bibcode= 2017Sci...356.1356A|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170702220009/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1356|archivedate= 2 July 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases of certain native tree species (i.e. [[conifers]]) in favor of others (i.e. leaf trees) also increases wildfire risk, especially if these trees are also planted in [[monoculture]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-07-biodiversity-criticism-sweden-forest-industry.html Fires spark biodiversity criticism of Sweden's forest industry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BE6B5/(httpNews)/531DAFFB8B319F69C125792E00499ED1 The Great Lie: Monoculture Trees as Forests]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[invasive species]], moved in by humans (i.e., for the [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper industry]]) have in some cases also increased the intensity of wildfires. Examples include species such as [[Eucalyptus]] in California&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.sc.us/forest/scplants.pdf Plant flammability list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.firesafemarin.org/plants/fire-prone Fire-prone plant list]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gamba grass]] in Australia.

However, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology. Early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the [[incident commander|fire manager]]. During the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]], a data station was established in [[West Yellowstone]], permitting the delivery of satellite-based fire information in approximately four hours.&lt;ref name = Integration/&gt;

Currently, public hotlines, [[fire lookout]]s in towers, and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires. However, accurate human observation may be limited by [[asthenopia|operator fatigue]], time of day, time of year, and geographic location. Electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error. A government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in Australia did, however, conclude "...detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer". These systems may be semi- or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence, as suggested by [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data analyses.

in 2015 a new fire detection tool is in operation at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) which uses data from the [[Suomi NPP|Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership]] (NPP) satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space-based products. The high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions.  The active fire detection product using data from Suomi NPP's [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters). Previous NASA satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution. The data is one of the intelligence tools used by the USFS and Department of Interior agencies across the United States to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions. The enhanced VIIRS fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long duration wildfires – capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression. Active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center, which uses technologies developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Direct Readout Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12–18 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction. The state of Colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season.

In 2014, an international campaign was organized in South Africa's Kruger National Park to validate fire detection products including the new VIIRS active fire data. In advance of that campaign, the Meraka Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa, an early adopter of the VIIRS 375m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in Kruger.

The demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years. Wildfires in the United States burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year. For the last 10 years, the USFS and Department of Interior have spent a combined average of about $2–4 billion annually on wildfire suppression.

[[File:RIAN archive 733844 Forest fires ravaging near Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.jpg|thumb|A Russian firefighter extinguishing a wildfire]]
Wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs. In less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm fronds.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 16&lt;/ref&gt; In more advanced nations, the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity. [[Silver iodide]] can be used to encourage snow fall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |title=China Makes Snow to Extinguish Forest Fire |publisher=FOXNews.com |accessdate=10 July 2009 |date=18 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813173448/http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |archivedate=13 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[fire retardant]]s and water can be dropped onto fires by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, [[airtanker|planes]], and [[helitack|helicopters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP//projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=21 July 2009 |title=Disaster Management Applications – Fire |first=Vincent G. |last=Ambrosia |publisher=NASA-Ames Research Center |date=2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724081427/http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP/projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plucinski, ''et al.'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; Complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation, but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control. While more than 99% of the 10,000 new wildfires each year are contained, escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather. Wildfires in Canada and the US burn an average of {{convert|54500|km2|acre|sigfig=2|sp=us}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |title=Fighting fire in the forest |publisher=CBS News |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619212242/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | title = Climate of 2008 Wildfire Season Summary | publisher = National Climatic Data Center | date = 11 December 2008 | accessdate = 7 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151023095354/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | archivedate = 23 October 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all, fighting wildfires can become deadly. A wildfire's burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks. Intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire, which can make fires particularly dangerous. For example, during the 1949 [[Mann Gulch fire]] in [[Montana]], USA, thirteen [[smokejumper]]s died when they lost their communication links, became disoriented, and were overtaken by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | title = General Technical Report INT-GTR-299 – Mann Gulch Fire: A Race That Couldn't Be Won | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station | date = May 1993 | last = Rothermel | first = Richard C. | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813122911/http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | archivedate = 13 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Australian [[February 2009 Victorian bushfires]], at least 173 people died and over 2,029 homes and 3,500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire.&lt;ref name="homeslost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|title=Victorian Bushfires|date=13 March 2009|publisher=New South Wales Government|work=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227231203/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|archivedate=27 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs of wildfire suppression ===
In California, the U.S. Forest Service spends about $200 million per year to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to $1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires that escape initial attack and become large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|title=Region 5 – Land &amp; Resource Management|website=www.fs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823005834/http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|archivedate=23 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wildland firefighting safety ===
[[File:Wildfire fighter.jpg|thumb|right|Wildfire fighters cutting down a tree using a chainsaw]]
Wildland fire fighters face several life-threatening hazards including [[heat stress]], [[fatigue (safety)|fatigue]], [[smoke]] and [[dust]], as well as the risk of other injuries such as [[burn]]s, [[wound|cuts]] and [[Abrasion (medical)|scrapes]], [[animal bites]], and even [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref name=niosh-blog&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting Safety and Health|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|work=NIOSH Science Blog|publisher=National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=6 August 2012|first=Corey|last=Campbell|author2=Liz Dalsey|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809023909/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|archivedate=9 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hot Tips from NIOSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030104/http://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000&amp;ndash;2016, more than 350&amp;nbsp;wildland firefighters died on-duty.&lt;ref name="NIOSH Wildland Firefighting default page"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/firefighting/default.html |title=CDC - Fighting Wildfires - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic |date=May 31, 2018 |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] |language=en-us |access-date=2018-11-27 |quote=Between 2000-2016, based on data compiled in the NIOSH Wildland Fire Fighter On-Duty Death Surveillance System from three data sources, over 350 on-duty WFF fatalities occurred.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in hot weather condition, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea. Heat stress can progress into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature. This can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat rash, cramps, exhaustion or [[heat stroke]]. Various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and [[Physical fitness|fitness]], dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome [[personal protective equipment]]. Rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Smoke, ash, and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland fire fighters. The smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[formaldehyde]], as well as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[silica]]. To reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up. Camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires. Protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks. Fire fighters should maintain good physical fitness. Fitness programs, medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt; Other injury hazards wildland fire fighters face include slips, trips and falls, burns, scrapes and cuts from tools and equipment, being struck by trees, vehicles, or other objects, plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy, snake and animal bites, vehicle crashes, electrocution from power lines or lightning storms, and unstable building structures.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

==Fire retardant==
Fire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion. They are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates, as well as thickening agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Agueda |author2=E. Pastor |author3=E. Planas |year=2008|title=Different scales for studying the effectiveness of long-term forest fire retardants|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|volume=24|issue=6|pages=782–796|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to apply retardant depends on the magnitude, location and intensity of the wildfire.   In certain instances, fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense measure.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Magill, B.|title=Officials: Fire slurry poses little threat|work=Coloradoan.com|url=http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20120706/NEWS01/307060035/Officials-Fire-slurry-poses-little-threat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical fire retardants contain the same agents as fertilizers.  Fire retardant may also affect water quality through leaching, eutrophication, or misapplication. Fire retardant's effects on drinking water remain inconclusive.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boerner, C. |author2=Coday B. |author3=Noble, J. |author4=Roa, P. |author5=Roux V. |author6=Rucker K. |author7=Wing, A. |year=2012 |title=Impact of wildfire in Clear Creek Watershed of the city of Golden's drinking water supply |publisher=Colorado School of Mines |url=http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112021046/http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilution factors, including water body size, rainfall, and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire retardant.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt; Wildfire debris (ash and sediment) clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and/or damage water treatment systems.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eichenseher, T.|year=2012|title=Colorado Wildfires Threaten Water Supplies|work=National Geographic Daily News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710084010/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land, water, wildlife habitats, and watershed quality, additional research is needed. However, on the positive side, fire retardant (specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components) has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient-deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt;

Current USDA procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the United States must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet in order to safeguard effects of retardant runoff. Aerial uses of fire retardant are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species (plant and animal habitats).  After any incident of fire retardant misapplication, the U.S. Forest Service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made in order to determine mitigation, remediation, and/or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area.

Using [[computational science]], wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior. Various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models. Early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity. However, the exact behavior of a wildfire's front is dependent on a variety of factors, including windspeed and slope steepness. Modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and [[Huygens' Principle]] to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon.&lt;ref&gt;G.D.

However, large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses, even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires.&lt;ref name="Alvarado, et al., 66-68"&gt;Alvarado, ''et al''., 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human risk and exposure==
{{wide image|2009 California Wildfires at JPL - Pasadena, California.jpg|933px|2009 California Wildfires at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|NASA/JPL]] – Pasadena, California}}

Wildfire risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does. Risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities, weather patterns, availability of wildfire fuels, and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Oregon State University|title=About Oregon wildfire risk|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218072405/http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations. However, human induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk. It is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire-prone wildlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |title=The National Wildfire Mitigation Programs Database: State, County, and Local Efforts to Reduce Wildfire Risk |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907045339/http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health.

===Airborne hazards===
The most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property. However, the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans.

Wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and benzene.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment|year=2008|title=Wildfire smoke: A guide for public health officials|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516071549/http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke. 80 -90% of wildfire smoke, by mass, is within the fine particle size class of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildlife Coordination Group|year=2001|title=Smoke management guide for prescribed and wildland fire|location=Boise, ID|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011200515/http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite carbon dioxide's high concentration in smoke, it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity. Rather, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter, particularly 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and smaller, have been identified as the major health threats.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt; Other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects.

The degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length, severity, duration, and proximity of the fire. People are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract though inhalation of air pollutants. Indirectly, communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) developed the [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI), a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants. The public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|year=2009|title=Air quality index: A guide to air quality and health|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507130507/http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-fire risks===
After a wildfire, hazards remain. Residents returning to their homes may be at risk from falling fire-weakened trees. Humans and pets may also be harmed by falling into [[ash pit]]s.

=== At-Risk Groups ===

==== Firefighters====
Firefighters are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure. Due to firefighters' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to [[Chemical hazard|hazardous chemicals]] at a close proximity for longer periods of time. A case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]-permissible exposure limits (PEL) and ACGIH threshold limit values (TLV). 5–10% are overexposed. The study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline. The firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritant (combination of particulate matter 3.5&amp;nbsp;µm and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehype) levels. Carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the TLV irritant index value reached a high of 10. In contrast, the OSHA PEL for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the TLV respiratory irritant index, the calculated threshold limit value is 1; any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Reinhardt|first2=T.E.|last3=Quiring|first3=S.J.|last4=Ottmar|first4=R.D.|year=2004|title=A screening-level assessment of the health risks of chronic smoke exposure for wildland firefighters|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|journal=Journal Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=1|issue=5|pages=296–305|doi=10.1080/15459620490442500|pmid=15238338|last1=Booze|first1=T.F.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530185250/https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2017|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.5076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2012, over 200 [[Occupational fatality|fatalities]] occurred among wildland firefighters. In addition to heat and chemical hazards, firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines; injuries from equipment; [[Occupational injury|slips, trips, and falls]]; injuries from vehicle rollovers; [[Heat illness|heat-related illness]]; [[insect bites and stings]]; [[Occupational stress|stress]]; and [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|title=CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy (2013–158)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122154309/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=dmy-all|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2013158|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Residents ====
Residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals, but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination. Exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility. Vulnerable persons such as children (ages 0–4), the elderly (ages 65 and older), smokers, and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems, even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov" /&gt;

==== Fetal exposure ====
Additionally, there is evidence of an increase in maternal stress, as documented by researchers M.H. O'Donnell and A.M. Behie, thus affecting birth outcomes.  In Australia, studies show that male infants born with drastically higher average birth weights were born in mostly severely fire-affected areas.  This is attributed to the fact that maternal signals directly affect fetal growth patterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=1&amp;SID=3A7lyhAIveCBgjBAcZa&amp;page=2&amp;doc=16{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/11/15/emph.eov027.abstract?papetoc|title = Effects of wildfire disaster exposure on male birth weight in an Australian population.|last = O'Donnell|first = M H|date = November 15, 2015|journal = Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health|doi = 10.1093/emph/eov027|pmid = 26574560|access-date = January 27, 2016|last2 = Behie|first2 = A M|volume = 2015|issue = 1|issn = 2050-6201|pages = 344–354|pmc = 4697771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jia Coco|last2=Wilson|first2=Ander|last3=Mickley|first3=Loretta J.|last4=Dominici|first4=Francesca|last5=Ebisu|first5=Keita|last6=Wang|first6=Yun|last7=Sulprizio|first7=Melissa P.|last8=Peng|first8=Roger D.|last9=Yue|first9=Xu|date=January 2017|title=Wildfire-specific Fine Particulate Matter and Risk of Hospital Admissions in Urban and Rural Counties|journal=Epidemiology|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=77–85|doi=10.1097/ede.0000000000000556|issn=1044-3983|pmc=5130603|pmid=27648592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[water vapor]], [[particulate matter]], organic chemicals, [[Nitrogen oxide|nitrogen oxides]] and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |title=1 Wildfire Smoke A Guide for Public Health Officials |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509110731/http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jin-Zhun|last2=Ge|first2=Dan-Dan|last3=Zhou|first3=Lin-Fu|last4=Hou|first4=Ling-Yun|last5=Zhou|first5=Ying|last6=Li|first6=Qi-Yuan|date=June 2018|title=Effects of particulate matter on allergic respiratory diseases|journal=Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine|volume=4|issue=2|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.04.001|issn=2095-882X|pmc=6034084|pmid=29988900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In asthma patients, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream like PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; however studies show that it works into the blood much quicker. The inflammation and epithelial damage done by UFP has also shown to be much more severe.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is of the largest concern in regards to wildfire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is particularly hazardous to the very young, elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions. The illnesses most commonly with exposure to fine particle from wildfire smoke are bronchitis, exacerbation of asthma or COPD, and pneumonia. Symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, rapid heart rate and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nurpra.2011.07.001 |title=Wildfire Smoke Exposure: A Guide for the Nurse Practitioner |date=2012 |last1=Forsberg |first1=Nicole T. |last2=Longo |first2=Bernadette M. |last3=Baxter |first3=Kimberly |last4=Boutté |first4=Marie |journal=[[The Journal for Nurse Practitioners]] |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=98–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with [[asthma]] related to PM from wildfires, a possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is the increased use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]], such as inhalers, in response to elevated levels of smoke among those already diagnosed with [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Colleen E.|last2=Brauer|first2=Michael|last3=Johnston|first3=Fay H.|last4=Jerrett|first4=Michael|last5=Balmes|first5=John R.|last6=Elliott|first6=Catherine T.|date=2016-04-15|title=Critical Review of Health Impacts of Wildfire Smoke Exposure|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en|volume=124|issue=9|pages=1334–43|doi=10.1289/ehp.1409277|issn=0091-6765|pmc=5010409|pmid=27082891}}&lt;/ref&gt; In investigating the association of medication use for obstructive lung disease and wildfire exposure, researchers found increases both in the usage of inhalers and initiation of long-term control as in oral steroids.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; More specifically, some people with [[asthma]] reported higher use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] (inhalers).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; After two major wildfires in California, researchers found an increase in physician prescriptions for [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] in the years following the wildfires than compared to the year before each occurrence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 

There is consistent evidence between wildfire smoke and the exacerbation of asthma.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Carbon monoxide danger ===
{{Main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be found at the highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire. For this reason, carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters. CO in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs. At high concentrations, it can cause headache, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, disorientation, visual impairment, coma and even death. However, even at lower concentrations, such as those found at wildfires, individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt;  A recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990–2006 found that 21.9% of the deaths occurred from heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildfire Coordinating Group|date=June 2007|title=Wildland firefighter fatalities in the United States 1990–2006|publisher=NWCG Safety and Health Working Team|url=http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315081248/http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders. Both adults and children from countries ranging from the United States and Canada to Greece and Australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with the wildfires. These include [[Post-traumatic stress disorder among athletes|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, and [[Phobia|phobias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21957753 |date=2011 |last1=Papanikolaou |first1=V |last2=Adamis |first2=D |last3=Mellon |first3=RC |last4=Prodromitis |first4=G |title=Psychological distress following wildfires disaster in a rural part of Greece: A case-control population-based study |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=11–26 |journal=International Journal of Emergency Mental Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jts.20411 |title=Locus of control and psychopathology in relation to levels of trauma and loss: Self-reports of Peloponnesian wildfire survivors |date=2009 |last1=Mellon |first1=Robert C. |last2=Papanikolau |first2=Vasiliki |last3=Prodromitis |first3=Gerasimos |journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=189–96 |pmid=19452533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.58.4.509 |title=Psychiatric Disorders Among Adults Seeking Emergency Disaster Assistance After a Wildland-Urban Interface Fire |date=2007 |last1=Marshall |first1=G.

In a new twist to wildfire health effects, former uranium mining sites were burned over in the summer of 2012 near North Fork, Idaho. This prompted concern from area residents and Idaho State Department of Environmental Quality officials over the potential spread of radiation in the resultant smoke, since those sites had never been completely cleaned up from radioactive remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Idaho Wildfire: Radiation Raises Slight Concern As Blaze Hits Former Uranium, Gold Mines|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|publisher=Huffington Post|first=Jessica|last=Leader|date=21 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021734/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|archivedate=26 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epidemiology ===
The western US has seen an increase in both frequency and intensity of wildfires over the last several decades. This increase has been attributed to the arid climate of the western US and the effects of global warming. An estimated 46 million people were exposed to wildfire smoke from 2004 to 2009 in the Western United States. Evidence has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can increase levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air, through the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|title=Particulate Matter (PM) Standards|date=April 24, 2016|publisher=EPA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815125540/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas, epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke.

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards are part of the Clean Air Act and provide mandated guidelines for pollutant levels and the monitoring of ambient air quality.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In addition to these monitoring programs, the increased incidence of wildfires near populated areas have precipitated several epidemiological studies. Such studies have demonstrated an association between negative human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke. The size of the particulate matter is significant as smaller particulate matter (fine) is easily inhaled into the human respiratory tract. Often, small particulate matter can be inhaled into deep lung tissue causing respiratory distress, illness, or disease.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

An increase in PM smoke emitted from the Hayman fire in Colorado in June 2002, was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2004.11.030 |title=Wildfire smoke and respiratory symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |date=2005 |last1=Sutherland |first1=E.

Children participating in the Children's Health Study were also found to have an increase in eye and respiratory symptoms, medication use and physician visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1164/rccm.200604-519OC |title=Health Effects of the 2003 Southern California Wildfires on Children |date=2006 |last1=Kunzli |first1=N. |last2=Avol |first2=E. |last3=Wu |first3=J. |last4=Gauderman |first4=W.

Suggesting that pregnant women may also be at greater risk to adverse effects from wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.1104515 |title=Birth Weight Following Pregnancy During the 2003 Southern California Wildfires |date=2012 |last1=Holstius |first1=David M. |last2=Reid |first2=Colleen E. |last3=Jesdale |first3=Bill M. |last4=Morello-Frosch |first4=Rachel |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=120 |issue=9 |pages=1340–5 |pmid=22645279 |pmc=3440113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide it is estimated that 339,000 people die due to the effects of wildfire smoke each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Fay H.|display-authors=etal|title=Estimated global mortality attributable to smoke from landscape fires|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=May 2012|url=http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/vfe/Landscape-Fire-Smoke-Global-Mortality-Johnston-2012.pdf|volume=120|issue=5|pages=695–701|doi=10.1289/ehp.1104422|pmc=3346787|pmid=22456494|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522061115/http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/vfe/Landscape-Fire-Smoke-Global-Mortality-Johnston-2012.pdf|archivedate=22 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the size of particulate matter is an important consideration for health effects, the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) from wildfire smoke should also be considered. Antecedent studies have demonstrated that the chemical composition of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; from wildfire smoke can yield different estimates of human health outcomes as compared to other sources of smoke.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Health outcomes for people exposed to wildfire smoke may differ from those exposed to smoke from alternative sources such as solid fuels.

The '''World Pantheist Movement''' ('''WPM''') is the world's largest organization of people associated with [[pantheism]], a [[philosophy]] which asserts that [[spirituality]] should be centered on [[nature]]. The WPM promotes [[naturalistic pantheism]]&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Bron|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|date=2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=1441122788|pages=1341–1342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4mvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1342&amp;lpg=PA134|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WPM grew out of a mailing list started by [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]] in 1997, arising around his Scientific Pantheism website. An initial group of 15 volunteers worked on a joint statement of agreed beliefs (the Pantheist Credo).&lt;ref name=Credo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheist Credo|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WPM officially opened for membership in December 1999.

== Beliefs and practices ==
The official views of the World Pantheist Movement are listed in the nine points of the Belief Statement (see external links).
These are summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=Credo /&gt;
    
* Reverence, awe, wonder and a feeling of unity with Nature and the wider Universe.
* Respect and active care for the rights of all humans and other living beings.
* Celebration of our lives in our bodies on this beautiful earth as a joy and a privilege.
* Realism - acceptance that the external world exists independently of human consciousness or perception.
* Strong naturalism - without belief in supernatural realms, afterlives, beings or forces.
* Respect for reason, evidence and the scientific method as our best ways of understanding nature and the Universe.
* Promotion of religious tolerance, freedom of religion and complete separation of state and religion.

The specific Statement is as follows:&lt;ref name=Credo /&gt;

* 1. We revere and celebrate the Universe as the totality of being, past, present and future. It is self-organizing, ever-evolving and inexhaustibly diverse. Its overwhelming power, beauty and fundamental mystery compel the deepest human reverence and wonder.
* 2. All matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part. We rejoice in our existence and seek to participate ever more deeply in this unity through knowledge, celebration, meditation, empathy, love, ethical action and art.
* 3. We are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally. We acknowledge the inherent value of all life, human and non-human, and strive to treat all living beings with compassion and respect.
* 4. All humans are equal centers of awareness of the Universe and nature, and all deserve a life of equal dignity and mutual respect. To this end we support and work towards freedom, democracy, justice, and non-discrimination, and a world community based on peace, sustainable ways of life, full respect for human rights and an end to poverty.
* 5. There is a single kind of substance, energy/matter, which is vibrant and infinitely creative in all its forms. Body and mind are indivisibly united.
* 6. We see death as the return to nature of our elements, and the end of our existence as individuals. The forms of "afterlife" available to humans are natural ones, in the natural world. Our actions, our ideas and memories of us live on, according to what we do in our lives. Our genes live on in our families, and our elements are endlessly recycled in nature.
* 7. We honor reality, and keep our minds open to the evidence of the senses and of science's unending quest for deeper understanding. These are our best means of coming to know the Universe, and on them we base our aesthetic and religious feelings about reality.
* 8. Every individual has direct access through perception, emotion and meditation to ultimate reality, which is the Universe and Nature. There is no need for mediation by priests, gurus or revealed scriptures.
* 9. We uphold the separation of religion and state, and the universal human right of freedom of religion. We recognize the freedom of all pantheists to express and celebrate their beliefs, as individuals or in groups, in any non-harmful ritual, symbol or vocabulary that is meaningful to them.

The WPM encourages wonder and awe at the beauty and mystery of the Universe and fosters the full range of positive emotional responses to life. It promotes ethical principles such as respect for the rights of humans and other living creatures, non-discrimination, justice and peace.

It respects the scientific method as humanity's most accurate approach for deepening its understanding of nature, while accepting that science is a never-ending quest and that some technologies have created massive social and environmental problems. It accepts that there are some questions that science may never answer - such as why anything exists, rather than nothing at all. It does not give any credence to ideas such as a separate soul distinct from the body, or of the consciousness' survival after death, but believes that people achieve a form of immortality through the ongoing effects of their actions, the things they create, others' memories, the legacy of their genes, and the recycling of their elements in nature.

It does not prescribe any particular set of religious practices, instead leaving the matter up to individuals. Pantheistic activity is viewed not as a ritual that must be upheld in order to placate gods and spirits, or to follow rules prescribed in scripture, but rather as an individual expression of one's deep feelings towards Nature and the wider Universe. Among members and friends of the WPM, the most common practices are meditation and close, daily observation of nature. Both of these are sometimes accompanied by the use of natural objects such as pebbles, shells, bark etc. About a quarter of WPM members report using some form of [[pagan]] celebration, but this is done for self-expression and fun, rather than out of literal belief in pagan theologies.

Members and friends may meet in small groups, the format of which varies. Groups may discuss general ideas; watch and discuss relevant (often nature-related) books, or films; share personal experiences; go on nature outings; or participate in nature conservation projects or other forms of community service.

Viewing the recycling of human elements in soil, water, and the atmosphere as a major element of human "immortality," the WPM supports the "natural death" approach. In this context, it seeks to return the elements to the natural cycle in the fastest and most responsible way possible, such as burial in a biodegradable container in nature-reserve type grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naturalizing Death|url=http://www.pantheism.net/pan/free/pan15s.pdf|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and activities ==
The WPM is governed by a board of 13 directors. Its main forms of activity consist of:
* A Facebook Page with over 162,000 members&lt;ref name=Facebook&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantheism Facebook group|url=http://www.facebook.com/Pantheism?v=wall|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A richly featured social network with over 3,000 members with wide-ranging discussions and interest groups, as well as 34 local forum groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantheism Forum at Ning|url=http://pantheists.ning.com/|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Its periodical, ''Pan''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public PAN Magazine Issues|url=https://www.scribd.com/pan8009/shelf|publisher=[[Scribd]]|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  explores the possibilities of naturalistic spirituality across a wide range of fields.
* Saving land to be managed in the interests of native wildlife, through direct sponsorship of conservation organizations, member click groups, and a pantheist wildlife reserves scheme. {{convert|300|acre|km2}} have been saved to date.
* A small [[Folding@home]] group that has contributed 204 work units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Team 13161's contributions to Folding@home|url=http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&amp;teamnum=13161|publisher=Folding@Home|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An associated [[SETI@home]] group that has amassed 2,138,435 credits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Pantheist|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=31590|publisher=SETI@Home|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Pantheist Movement symbol is the spiral as seen in the curves of the nautilus shell, or in the spiral arms of a galaxy, showing the link between the cosmic physical (thousands of light years) and the biological. Sometimes the Nautilus spiral alone is used; it embodies the [[Fibonacci series]] and the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Pantheist Art|url=http://www.pantheism.net/pan/free/pan9.pdf|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diversity of beliefs ==
The WPM has a policy of accepting a diversity of language and methods of celebration among its members, although - following large surveys of its website visitors' preferences - it generally avoids overtly theistic or religious language in its official literature. Some members view themselves as [[atheism|atheists]], while others hold [[agnosticism|agnostic]] stances. Some members use [[theism|theistic]] vocabulary, however they do not believe in a thinking [[Creator deity|creator god]], and simply use the word "[[God]]" to describe their feelings of reverence towards Nature and the wider Universe. Some members, while accepting the basic naturalistic beliefs of the WPM, like to combine these with symbols and ceremonies from other traditions, most commonly paganism, philosophical [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]].

The WPM does not interfere with or promote any specific personal choices regarding sexuality or the use of recreational or psychotropic drugs. Similarly, members have a diversity of views on [[vegetarianism]], hunting, non-violence, and many other political, social, and technological issues. All these issues are left to members' understanding of Naturalistic Pantheistic morality and the Belief Statement.

== Relationship to other pantheist organizations ==
[[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]], the World Pantheist Movement founder, was vice president of the [[Universal Pantheist Society]] (UPS) in the mid-1990s, but resigned after becoming skeptical of the possibility of promoting "generic" pantheism given the very wide variety of beliefs held by different types of pantheist (specifically, by those with naturalistic beliefs and those with dualist or idealist beliefs). The WPM has since gained a membership considerably larger than the UPS, along with a wider circle of non-members who participate in its online forum and Facebook pages.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
