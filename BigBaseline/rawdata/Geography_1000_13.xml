The '''Age of Discovery''', or the '''Age of Exploration''' (approximately from the beginning of the [[15th century]] until the end of the [[18th century]]) is an informal and loosely defined term for the [[historical period|period]] in [[Europe]]an  history in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and was the beginning of [[globalization]]. It also marks the rise of the period of widespread adoption in Europe of [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] as national policies. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents. 
 
Global exploration started with the [[Portuguese discoveries]] of the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], the coast of Africa, and the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498; and the [[Crown of Castile]] ([[Spain]]) the trans-Atlantic [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas between 1492 and 1502 and the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late [[19th century]], and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the [[20th century]].

European overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the ''[[Old World]]'' (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ''[[New World]]'' (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]; a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. This represented one of the most-significant [[globalization|global]] events concerning ecology, agriculture and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary: A History of Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]]. Under the direction of [[Henry the Navigator]], the Portuguese developed a new, much lighter ship, the [[caravel]], which could sail further and faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1488 [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reached the Indian Ocean by this route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/bartolomeudias.html |title=Bartolomeu Dias |website=infoplease |publisher=Sandbox Networks, Inc. |date= |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] funded [[Christopher Columbus]]'s plan to sail west to reach the [[Indies]] by crossing the Atlantic. He landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a [[new world]], the Americas. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus – Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, "Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580", p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years [[Portuguese India Armadas]] also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and later by Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], sailing westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas – The Story of Magellan", Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4067-6006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s'' explored the interior of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.

Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of [[John Cabot]] in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s, Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of [[Russian conquest of Siberia|Siberia]], and Alaska in the 1730s.

==Background==
{{See also|Early world maps|Chronology of European exploration of Asia}}

===Rise of European trade===
Between the 12th and 15th centuries the European economy was transformed by the interconnecting of river and sea trade routes, causing Europe to become one of the world's most prosperous trading networks.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC |location= New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} 

Before the 12th century the main obstacle to trade east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] was lack of commercial incentive rather than inadequate ship design.  Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus|parts of Muslim Spain]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|316-38}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|328}}

===Technology: ship design and the compass===
[[File:Sd11-boom.JPG|thumb|left|A large dhow with two lateen sail rigs and a [[headsail]].  Dhows had superior maneuverability and were used in the Indian Ocean before being built in Italy in the 13th century.]]Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Exploration were the adoption of the [[compass|magnetic compass]] and advances in ship design.  

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars.  The compass had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last=Merson |first= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7|pages=|postscript = &lt;A companion to the PBS Series "The Genius That Was China"&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|351-2}} The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  The Europeans used a "dry" compass, with a needle on a pivot.  The compass card was also a European invention.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

[[File:Adler von Lübeck. Model ship 05.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] stern-post rudder of the [[Hanseatic league]] flagship ''[[Adler von Lübeck]]'' (1567–1581]] The Chinese also made several important improvements in ship design, such as the sternpost rudder, multiple masts and lateen sails.  These improvements gave greater maneuverability and allowed ships to sail at any time of the year.  These new style ships were produced in Italian states between 1280 and 1330, resulting in a boost in trade and connectivity between northern and southern Europe.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"/&gt;  [[Cog (ship)|Cogs]] remained popular for trade because of their low cost. [[Galley]]s were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Ships grew in size, required smaller crews and were able to sail longer distances without stopping.  This led to significant lower long distance shipping costs by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

===Geography and maps===
The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], a document dating from 40-60 AD, describes a newly discovered route through the Red Sea to India, with descriptions of the markets in towns around Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, including along the eastern coast of Africa, which states "for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea (possible reference to the Atlantic Ocean)".  European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back from the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. 
Another source was the [[Radhanite|Radhanite Jewish trade networks]] of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the [[Crusader states]].

[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - world map.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century) in a 15th-century reconstruction]]
In 1154, the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] created a description of the world and a [[world map]], the [[Tabula Rogeriana]], at the court of King [[Roger II of Sicily]],&lt;ref name=houben&gt;Houben, 2002, pp. 102–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley &amp; Woodward, 1992, pp. 156–61.&lt;/ref&gt; but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African [[Sahara]], but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from [[Early world maps|old]] Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] exploration of [[Mauritania]]. The [[Red Sea]] was barely known and only trade links with the [[Maritime republics]], the [[Republic of Venice]] especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the [[Yongle Emperor]] of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] sponsored a series of long range [[Treasure voyages|tributary missions]] under the command of [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleets visited [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Thailand]]. But the journeys, reported by [[Ma Huan]], a [[Muslim]] voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and were not followed up, as the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade.

By 1400 a Latin translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; both for mapmaking and worldview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Love 2006|Love 2006]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.

=== Medieval travel (1241–1438) ===
[[File:Silk route copy.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Silk Road]] and [[spice trade]] routes later blocked by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453 spurring exploration to find alternative sea routes]]
[[File:Travels of Marco Polo.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Marco Polo]] travels (1271–1295)]]

A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing [[Eurasia]] by land in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#silk-road 2008|silk-road 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Mongols]] had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'' allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the [[Maritime republics]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The close [[Italian city-states|Italian]] links to the [[Levant]] raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Fortune|last=Crowley|first=Roger|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571245956|edition=Main|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

There are a few accounts of merchants from North Africa and the Mediterranean region who traded in the Indian Ocean in late medieval times.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Christian embassies were sent as far as [[Karakorum]] during the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]], from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first of these travellers was [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], dispatched by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Great Khan]], who journeyed to [[Mongolia]] and back from 1241 to 1247.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; About the same time, Russian prince [[Yaroslav of Vladimir]], and subsequently his sons [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir]], travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French [[André de Longjumeau]] and Flemish [[William of Rubruck]], who reached China through Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo]], a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the [[Yuan Dynasty]] court of [[Kublai Khan]] in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', and it was read throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1291, in a first Atlantic exploration attempt, merchant brothers [[Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi]] sailed from Genoa with two galleys but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding the fears of oceanic travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 2006|Parry 2006]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1325 to 1354, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar from [[Tangier]], [[Ibn Battuta]], journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar he met in Granada, the ''[[Rihla]]'' ("The Journey"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunn 2004|Dunn 2004]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by [[John Mandeville]] acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts it was used as a reference&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the [[Axis mundi|centre of the world]].

Following the period of [[Timurid relations with Europe]], in 1439 [[Niccolò de' Conti]] published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia and, later in 1466–1472, Russian merchant [[Afanasy Nikitin]] of [[Tver]] travelled to India, which he described in his book ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''.

These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The [[Mongol Empire]] collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The [[Black Death]] of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] further limited the possibilities of European overland trade.

===Chinese missions (1405–1433)===
{{Further|Treasure voyages|Chinese exploration}}
[[File:Stellardiagram-Zhengho.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|"Mao Kun map", believed to be based on [[Zheng He]]'s travels, showing sailing directions between ports of SE Asia and as far as Malindi, in ''[[Wu Bei Zhi]]'' (1628)]]
The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and had been sailing to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]] since the [[Tang Dynasty]] (AD 618–907). Between 1405 and 1421 the third Ming emperor [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] sponsored a series of long range [[tribute|tributary missions]] in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A large fleet of new [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships was prepared for these international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks—that the Chinese termed [[Chinese treasure ship|''bao chuan'' (treasure ships)]]—may have measured 121 metres (400&amp;nbsp;feet) stem to stern, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Malay Archipelago]] and [[Thailand]] (at the time called [[Siam]]), exchanging goods along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tamura 1997|Tamura 1997]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented gifts of gold, silver, [[porcelain]] and [[silk]]; in return, received such novelties as [[ostrich]]es, [[zebra]]s, [[camel]]s, [[ivory]] and [[giraffe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cromer 1995|Cromer 1995]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tsai 2002|Tsai 2002]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; After the emperor's death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is very likely that this last expedition reached as far as [[Madagascar]]. The travels were reported by [[Ma Huan]], a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zheng He on three of the seven expeditions, his account published as "Ying-Yai Sheng-Lam" (Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) (1433).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

These long distance journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands turning inward,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; [[Hongxi Emperor]] ended further expeditions and [[Xuande Emperor]] suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's voyages.

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]]]]

From the 8th century until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] and neighbouring [[maritime republics]] held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East.   The [[Silk Road|silk]] and [[spice trade]], involving [[spice]]s, [[incense]], [[herb]]s, [[drug]]s and [[opium]], made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in [[medieval medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Spice importance for medieval [[humorism]] principles of medicine was such that shortly after entering the trade, apothecaries and physicians like [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Garcia de Orta|Garcia da Orta]] (see [[#Burns 2001|Burns 2001]], p. 14) were sent to India having studied spices in works like ''Suma Oriental'' (see [[#Pires 1512|Pires 1512]], p. lxii) and ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' ("Conversations on the simples, drugs and materia medica of India)&lt;/ref&gt; religious [[ritual]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]ry, as well as [[food additive]]s and [[Food preservatives|preservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ScienceDaily 1998|ScienceDaily 1998]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They were all imported from Asia and Africa.

Muslim traders—mainly descendants of Arab sailors from [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]—dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly [[Kozhikode]], westward to [[Ormus]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Jeddah]] in the [[Red Sea]]. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], that eventually led to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1453-09&gt;{{cite web|title=

Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] had turned to North African trade of wheat, [[olive oil]] (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant [[Commercial Revolution#Monetary factors|deficit in silver and gold]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], pp. 339–49.&lt;/ref&gt; as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of [[bullion]] leading to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, ''[[Bank of Saint George|Banco di San Giorgio]]'', was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of [[Bruges]] (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.

European sailing had been primarily close to land [[cabotage]], guided by [[portolan chart]]s. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a [[compass]] heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the [[compass]], as well as progressive new advances in [[cartography]] and [[astronomy]]. Arab navigational tools like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] were used for [[celestial navigation]].

===Portuguese exploration===

In 1297, with the Portuguese part of the [[reconquista]] completed, King [[Dinis of Portugal]] took personal interest in exports and in 1317 he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor [[Manuel Pessanha]] (Pesagno), appointing him first [[admiral]] of the [[Portuguese navy]], with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1325 and 1357 [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1960|Diffie 1960]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canary Islands]], already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under patronage of the Portuguese but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butel 1999|Butel 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure their monopoly on trade, Europeans (beginning with the Portuguese) attempted to install a mediterranean system of trade which used military might and intimidation to divert trade through ports they controlled; there it could be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade and Civilization in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750|last=Chaudhuri|first=K. N.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1415, [[Ceuta]] was [[Battle of Ceuta|conquered]] by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes. For centuries [[Arab slave trade|slave and gold]] trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.

Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; like the long-lost Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and to probe whether it was possible to reach the [[Indies]] by sea, the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of [[Mauritania]], gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1419) and the [[Azores]] (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was [[João Gonçalves Zarco]].&lt;ref&gt;Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age Of Prince Henry The Navigator. (New York: Dutton), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Non]] (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Locke 1824|Locke 1824]], p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Prince Henry's navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult [[Cape Bojador]] that in 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]], finally passed.

A major advance was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail [[Windward and leeward|windward]] more than any other in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal [[cabotage]] navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For [[celestial navigation]] the Portuguese used the [[Ephemerides]], which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician [[Abraham Zacuto]], the [[Almanach Perpetuum]] included some of these tables for the movements of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Nissan Mindel, Rabbi Abraham Zacuto – (1450–1515), http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111917/jewish/Rabbi-Abraham-Zacuto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of [[latitude]]. Exact [[longitude]], however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russell-Wood 1998|Russell-Wood 1998]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] and [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445 and in 1446, [[Álvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]].

In 1453 the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the hands of the [[Ottomans]] was a blow to Christendom and the established business relations linking with the east. In 1455 [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' reinforcing the previous ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his successors, as well as trade and conquest against Muslims and pagans, initiating a ''[[mare clausum]]'' policy in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daus 1983|Daus 1983]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], which arrived in Lisbon in 1459.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagrow 1964|Bagrow 1964]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1456 [[Diogo Gomes]] reached the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago. In the next decade several captains at the service of Prince Henry – including the Genoese [[Antonio da Noli]] and Venetian [[Alvise Cadamosto]] – discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.

==== Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry ====
In 1460 [[Pedro de Sintra]] reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant [[Fernão Gomes]] in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} each year for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 145–48.&lt;/ref&gt; With his sponsorship, explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gonçalves, [[Fernão do Pó]], and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the [[Southern Cross]] as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the "Gold Coast" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.

In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479. (See entry on Elmina.) This was the first colonial war among European powers.

In 1481 the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|João II]] decided to build [[Elmina Castle|São Jorge da Mina]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]]. In 1482 the [[Congo River]] was explored by [[Diogo Cão]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1486 continued to [[Cape Cross]] (modern [[Namibia]]).

The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at [[Mossel Bay]] and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the [[Great Fish River]], proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously [[Pêro da Covilhã]], sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]] having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the cape was renamed by king [[John II of Portugal]] the "[[Cape of Good Hope]]" (Cabo da Boa Esperança), because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the Indian Ocean was [[Landlocked country|land-locked]].

Based on much later stories of the [[phantom island]] known as [[Bacalao]] and the carvings on [[Dighton Rock]] some have speculated that Portuguese explorer [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] discovered [[Newfoundland]] in 1473, but the sources cited are considered by mainstream historians to be unreliable and unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lusa|title=Portugueses chegaram à América 19 anos antes de Colombo|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/cultura/2016-02-27-Portugueses-chegaram-a-America-19-anos-antes-de-Colombo|publisher=Expresso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish exploration: Columbus and the West Indies===
{{see also|Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Viajes de colon en.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The four voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] 1492–1503]]

Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], had begun to establish its rule over the [[Canary Islands]], located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ''[[reconquista]]'', did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Sardinia]], with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Niña]]''. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the [[Sargasso Sea]].

Land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', in what he thought to be the "[[Caribbean|West Indies]]". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagaríx|Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
[[File:TresCarabelas.jpg|thumb|left|Replicas of ''[[Niña]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' and ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' at [[Palos de la Frontera]], Spain]] Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maclean 2008|Maclean 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native 'Indians' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forbes 1993|Forbes 1993]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
On the return, a storm forced him to dock in [[Lisbon]], on 4 March 1493. After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in [[Barcelona]], where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries—unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.

===Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)===
{{Main|Treaty of Tordesillas}}
[[File:Spain and Portugal.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesilhas Treaty]] meridian (purple) and the later [[Maluku Islands]] [[180th meridian|antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]]]]

Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] received a [[Papal bull|bull]] (''[[Inter caetera]]'') from [[Pope Alexander VI]] stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

King [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land—preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.

Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.

===A New World: Americas===
[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseemüller map]] showing the name "America" for the first time.]]
Very little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.

====North America====
That year [[John Cabot]], also a commissioned Italian, got [[letters patent]] from King [[Henry VII of England]]. Sailing from [[Bristol]], probably backed by the local [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the "West Indies" would be shorter&lt;ref&gt;[[#Croxton 2007|Croxton 2007]], web (on subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].
In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they first sighted [[Labrador]], which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 463–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of [[Greenland]] and also Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 464–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations are noted in the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

====The "True Indies" and Brazil====
In 1497, newly crowned King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]] on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.

As shipping between [[Seville]] and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew.
One of these Spanish fleets, that of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1499–1500, reached land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in July 1499,&lt;ref name=Pohl1966&gt;{{cite book

In the beginning of 1500 [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzon]] was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of [[Pernambuco]]. His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named ''Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce'' (''Saint Mary's River of the Freshwater Sea'').&lt;ref name=Morison1974&gt;{{cite book

The 1515–16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.

In April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "[[volta do mar]]" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de Pêro Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494—so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crow 1992|Crow 1992]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India.

At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 456–62.&lt;/ref&gt;—a Florentine who had been working for a branch of the [[Medici Bank]] in [[Seville]] since 1491, fitting oceanic expeditions and travelling twice to [[The Guianas]] with [[Juan de la Cosa]] in the service of Spain&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2|Catholic Encyclopædia 2]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—participated as observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "[[New World]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arciniegas 1978|Arciniegas 1978]], pp. 295–300.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mundus novus'', Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], which had become widely popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. [[America (name)|The Americas were named]] in 1507 by [[Cartography|cartographer]]s [[Waldseemüller map|Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]], probably after Amerigo Vespucci.

In 1501–1502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] (and/or [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52° S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern [[Patagonia]] (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50°/52° S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/839287/language/en-US/Default.aspx The Invention of America].

In 1503, [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville]], challenging the Portuguese policy of ''[[mare clausum]]'', led one of the earliest [[French people|French]] [[Normandy|Normand]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope his ship was diverted to west by a storm, and landed in the present day state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.

In 1511–1512, Portuguese captains [[João de Lisboa]] and Estevão de Fróis reached the [[Rio de La Plata|River Plate]] estuary in present-day [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]], and went as far south as the present-day [[Gulf of San Matias]] at 42°S (recorded in the ''Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt'' meaning "New Tidings from the Land of Brazil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After they had navigated for nearly {{convert|300|km|0|abbr=on}} to round the cape, they again sighted the continent on the other side, and steered towards the northwest, but a storm prevented them from making any headway.

Nuno Manuel), who would serve the Spanish Crown after 1516, believed that the navigators had discovered a southern ''strait'' to west and Asia.

In 1519, an expedition sent by the Spanish Crown to find a way to Asia was led by the experienced Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. The fleet explored the rivers and bays as it charted the South American coast until it found a way to the Pacific Ocean through the [[Strait of Magellan]].

In 1524–1525, [[Aleixo Garcia]], a Portuguese conquistador (possibly a veteran of the Solís expedition of 1516), led a private expedition of a few shipwrecked Castilian and Portuguese adventurers, that recruited about 2000 [[Guaraní people|Guaraní Indians]]. They explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], using the native trail network, the ''Peabiru''. They were also the first Europeans to cross the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reach the outer territories of the Inca Empire on the hills of the [[Andes]], near [[Sucre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/sv/svh009b.htm ''Peabiru, the route lost''] in English&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian Ocean (1497–1513)==

===Gama's route to India===

{{see also|Portuguese India Armadas}}

[[File:Caminho maritimo para a India.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1497–1499 travel to India (black). Previous travels of [[Pêro da Covilhã]] (orange) and [[Afonso de Paiva]] (blue), and their common route (green)]]

Protected from direct Spanish competition by the treaty of Tordesillas, Portuguese eastward exploration and colonization continued apace. Twice, in 1485 and 1488, Portugal officially rejected [[Christopher Columbus]]'s idea of reaching India by sailing westwards. King [[John II of Portugal]]'s experts rejected it, for they held the opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was undervalued,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morison 1942|Morison 1942]], pp. 65–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in part because [[Bartolomeu Dias]] departed in 1487 trying the rounding of the southern tip of Africa, therefore they believed that sailing east would require a far shorter journey. Dias's return from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, and [[Pêro da Covilhã]]'s travel to [[Ethiopia]] overland indicated that the richness of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Sea]] was accessible from the Atlantic. A long-overdue expedition was prepared.

[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Outward and return voyages of the [[Portuguese India Armadas]] in the Atlantic and the Indian oceans, with the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] (''[[Volta do mar]]'') picked up by [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]]'s navigators, and the outward route of the South Atlantic westerlies that [[Bartolomeu Dias]] discovered in 1488, followed and explored by the expeditions of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]]]

Under new king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], on July 1497 a small exploratory fleet of four ships and about 170 men left [[Lisbon]] under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]]. By December the fleet passed the [[Great Fish River]]—where Dias had turned back—and sailed into unknown waters. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favourable trading conditions were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World|last=Bernstein|first=William J.|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802144164|date=2008|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India.

In 1500, a second, larger fleet of thirteen ships and about 1500 men were sent to India. Under command of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] they made a first landfall on the Brazilian coast; later, in the Indian Ocean, one of Cabral's ships reached [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] in 1507; [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506. In the same year [[Lourenço de Almeida]] landed in [[Sri Lanka]], the eastern island named "[[Names of Sri Lanka|Taprobane]]" in remote accounts of [[Alexander the Great]]'s and 4th-century BC Greek [[geographer]] [[Megasthenes]]. On the Asiatic mainland the first [[factory (trading post)|factories (trading-posts)]] were established at Kochi and Calicut (1501) and then [[Old Goa|Goa]] (1510).

===The "Spice Islands" and China===
[[File:Malaccaship.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Replica of ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' [[carrack]] housing the Maritime Museum of [[Malacca]]]]

In 1511, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]] for Portugal, then the centre of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic missions: [[Duarte Fernandes]] as the first European envoy to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (modern [[Thailand]]).

Getting to know the secret location of the so-called "spice islands"—the [[Maluku Islands]], mainly the [[Banda Islands|Banda]], then the single world source of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s, was the main purpose for the travels in the Indian sea—he sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] to Banda (via [[Java]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]), where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512, after taking a route through which they also reached first the islands of [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milton 1999|Milton 1999]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Armando|last=Cortesão|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false|title=The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512–1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515|publisher=The [[Hakluyt Society]]|year=1944|accessdate=2016-02-10|isbn=9788120605350}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Banda Abreu returned to Malacca, while his vice-captain [[Francisco Serrão]], after a separation forced by a shipwreck and heading north, reached once again Ambon and sank off [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the Fort of São João Baptista de Ternate, which founded the Portuguese presence in the [[Malay Archipelago]].

In May 1513 [[Jorge Álvares]], one of the Portuguese envoys, reached China. Although he was the first to land on [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]], it was [[Rafael Perestrello]]—a cousin of the famed [[Christopher Columbus]]—who became the first European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in [[Guangzhou]] in 1516, commanding a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] vessel with a crew from a Malaysian junk that had sailed from [[Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfoundes 1882|Pfoundes 1882]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nowell 1947|Nowell 1947]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China. The Portuguese were defeated by the Chinese in 1521 at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] and in 1522 at the [[Battle of Xicaowan]], during which the Chinese captured Portuguese [[breech-loading swivel gun]]s and reverse engineered the technology, calling them "Folangji" 佛郎機 ([[Farangi|Frankish]]) guns, since the Portuguese were called "Folangji" by the Chinese. After a few decades, hostilities between the Portuguese and Chinese ceased and in 1557 the Chinese allowed the Portuguese to occupy [[Macau]].

To enforce a trade monopoly, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], were seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507 and in 1515, respectively. He also entered into [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1513 while trying to conquer [[Aden]], an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the [[Red Sea]] inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], and sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island. In 1521, a force under [[António Correia (admiral)|António Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]], ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole 2002|Cole 2002]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Red Sea, [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]].

==Pacific Ocean (1513–1529)==
[[File:Balboa Voyage 1513.PNG|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s travel to the "[[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]", 1513]]

===Discovery of the Pacific Ocean===
In 1513, about {{convert|40|mi|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Acandí]], in present-day [[Colombia]], Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] heard unexpected news of an "other sea" rich in gold, which he received with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otfinoski 2004|Otfinoski 2004]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With few resources and using information given by ''[[cacique]]s'', he journeyed across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] with 190 Spaniards, a few native guides, and a pack of dogs.

Using a small [[brigantine]] and ten native [[canoe]]s, they sailed along the coast and made landfalls. On September 6, the expedition was reinforced with 1,000 men, fought several battles, entered a dense jungle and climbed the mountain range along the [[Chucunaque River]] from where this "other sea" could be seen. Balboa went ahead and, before noon September 25, he saw in the horizon an undiscovered sea, becoming the first European to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. The expedition descended towards the shore for a short reconnaissance trip, thus becoming the first Europeans to navigate the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the New World. After travelling more than {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, Balboa named the bay where they ended up [[Bay of San Miguel|''San Miguel'']]. He named the new sea [[Pacific Ocean|''Mar del Sur'' (South Sea)]], since they had travelled south to reach it. Balboa's main purpose in the expedition was the search for gold-rich kingdoms. To this end, he crossed through the lands of ''caciques'' to the islands, naming the largest one ''Isla Rica'' (Rich Island, today known as [[Isla del Rey (Panama)|Isla del Rey]]). He named the entire group ''[[Pearl Islands|Archipiélago de las Perlas]]'', which they still keep today.

===Subsequent developments to the east===
In 1515–1516, the Spanish fleet led by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] sailed down the east coast of South America as far as [[Río de la Plata]], which Solís named shortly before he died, while trying to find a passage to the "South Sea".

At the same time, the Portuguese in Southeast Asia made the [[First Europeans in the Philippines|first European report on the western Pacific]], having identified [[Luzon]] east of [[Borneo]] and named its inhabitants the "[[Luções]]", in the modern [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

===First circumnavigation===
[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Route of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] world circumnavigation (1519–1522)]]

By 1516 several Portuguese navigators, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, had gathered in [[Seville]] to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. Among them were explorers Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[Estêvão Gomes]], [[João Serrão]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], cartographers [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]], cosmographers Francisco and [[Rui Faleiro|Ruy Faleiro]] and the Flemish merchant [[Christopher de Haro]]. Ferdinand Magellan—who had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the [[Maluku Islands]] were reached, kept contact with [[Francisco Serrão]] living there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zweig 1938|Zweig 1938]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donkin 2003|Donkin 2003]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;—developed the theory that the islands were in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] Spanish area, supported on studies by Faleiro brothers.

Aware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan's expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships—the [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan's command, ''San Antonio'', ''Concepcion'', ''Santiago'' and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the first being a [[caravel]], and all others rated as [[carrack]]s or "naus"—with a crew of about 237 men from several nations, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain's economic and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the single ship to have completed the first world [[circumnavigation]]. (Detail from ''[[Maris Pacifici]]'' by [[Ortelius]], 1589.)]]

The fleet sailed further and further south, avoiding the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and became the first to reach [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the tip of the Americas. On October 21, starting in [[Cape Virgenes]], they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600&amp;nbsp;km) long strait that Magellan named ''Estrecho de Todos los Santos'', the modern [[Strait of Magellan]]. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named ''Mar Pacífico'' because of its apparent stillness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2007|Catholic Encyclopædia 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], leaving the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] the task of completing the voyage, reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1521. On September 6, 1522 ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, thus completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.

This round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]]. Although this was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Strait of Magellan]] was too far south, and the Pacific Ocean too vast to cover in a single trip from Spain) successive Spanish expeditions used this information to explore the Pacific Ocean and discovered routes that [[Manila galleon|opened up trade]] between [[Acapulco]], [[New Spain]] (present-day [[Mexico]]) and [[Manila]] in the Philippines.

===Westward and eastward exploration meet===

[[File:Saavedra-1527-1529.svg|thumb|Saavedra's failed attempts to find a return route from the Maluku to New Spain (Mexico) in 1529]]
Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese rushed to seize the surviving crew and built a fort in [[Ternate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1525, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] sent another expedition westward to colonize the [[Maluku Islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] and included the most notable Spanish navigators: [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and Loaísa, who lost their lives then, and the young [[Andrés de Urdaneta]].

Near the [[Strait of Magellan]] one of the ships was pushed south by a storm, reaching 56° S, where they thought seeing "''earth's end''": so [[Cape Horn]] was crossed for the first time. The expedition reached the islands with great difficulty, docking at [[Tidore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The conflict with the Portuguese established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named "Islands de Sequeira".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea. Based on these explorations stands the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]], one among several competing theories about the early discovery of Australia, supported by Australian historian [[Kenneth McIntyre]], stating it was discovered by [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] and Gomes de Sequeira.

In 1527 [[Hernán Cortés]] fitted out a fleet to find new lands in the "South Sea" (Pacific Ocean), asking his cousin [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] to take charge. On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519–1532)==
Rumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the "[[conquistadors]]", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.

In 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de León]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt; With three ships and about 200 men, Léon set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513. In April they sighted land and named it ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''—because it was [[Easter]] (Florida) season—believing it was an island, becoming credited as the first European to land in the continent. The arrival location has been disputed between [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ponce de León Inlet]] and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. They headed south for further exploration and on April 8 encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards: this was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] that would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Weddle 1985|Weddle 1985]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They explored down the coast reaching [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Dry Tortugas]] and then sailing southwest in an attempt to circle [[Cuba]] to return, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on July.

===Cortés' Mexico and the Aztec Empire===

[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|Route of Cortés inland progress 1519–1521]]
In 1517 [[Cuba]]'s governor [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] commissioned a fleet under the command of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Hernández de Córdoba]] to explore the [[Yucatán peninsula]]. They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Velázquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Velázquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hernán Cortés]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.

In February 1519 Cortés went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucatán, in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory,&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"&gt;[[#Grunberg 2007|Grunberg 2007]], magazine&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From [[Trinidad]] he proceeded to [[Tabasco]] and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was [[La Malinche]], his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) [[Nahuatl language]] and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Through her, Cortés learned about the wealthy [[Aztec Empire]].

In July his men took over [[Veracruz]] and he placed himself under direct orders of new king [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; There Cortés asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor [[Montezuma II]], who repeatedly refused. They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.
[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitlán]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cortés' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]
Arriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cortés enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned then that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] or Quetzalcoatl himself—a belief contested by a few modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Restall 2004|Restall 2004]], pp. 659–87.&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.

Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], to oppose Cortès, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitlán one of Cortés's lieutenants committed a [[massacre in the Great Temple]], triggering local rebellion. Cortés speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castillo 1963|Castillo 1963]], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'', where they managed a narrow escape while their back guard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; After [[Battle of Otumba|a battle in Otumba]] they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Having prevailed with the assistance of allies and reinforcements from [[Cuba]], Cortés [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|besieged Tenochtitlán]] and captured its ruler [[Cuauhtémoc]] in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.

===Pizarro's Peru and the Inca Empire===
[[File:Conquest peru 1531 edited.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Francisco Pizarro]]'s route of exploration during the conquest of [[Peru]] (1531–1533)]]

A first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pirú. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about "Pirú" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hernán Cortés]], caught the attention of Pizarro.

[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the "''Empresa del Levante''": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.

Pizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian."'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.

They decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called "little camels". The natives named the Spanish "Children of the Sun" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.

In the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulación de Toledo''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hernándo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].

Pizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Huáscar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would "be no man's tributary." There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.

In 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: "''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&amp;nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.

==New trade routes (1542–1565)==
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]

In 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]] attributed to [[Kanō Naizen]], 1570–1616 Japan]]

He reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Thus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.

==Northern European involvement (1595 – 17th century)==
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the "first modern atlas". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]

Nations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.

In 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.

Philip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.

The emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten"'' (''"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East"'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book&lt;/ref&gt; This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.

Dutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploring North America===
[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609–1611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]

The 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520–1521 the Portuguese [[João Álvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban Gómez|Estevão Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named "The Country of Canadas]]", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]

Europeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California]] was a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gutierrez 1998|Gutierrez 1998]]. pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his discoveries, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an [[Island of California|island]]. His account provided the first recorded use of the name "California". [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo|João Rodrigues Cabrilho]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542 on the shores of [[San Diego Bay]] and claiming California for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San Diego HS|San Diego HS]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; He also landed on [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], and continued as far as [[Point Reyes]]. After his death the crew continued exploring as far north as [[Oregon]].

The English naval commander [[Francis Drake]] sailed along the coast in 1579 somewhere north of Cabrillo's landing site—the actual location of Drake's landing was secret and is still undetermined
&lt;ref&gt;Sir Francis Drake Association | http://www.SirFrancisDrakeAssociation.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Drake N.Guild|Drake N.Guild]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—and claimed the land for England,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wright's World Chart 1599 documents a Land Claim | http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0082288414Z.00000000027&lt;/ref&gt; calling it [[New Albion|Nova Albion]]. The term "Nova Albion" was therefore used on many European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#USF 2010|USF 2010]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1609 and 1611, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]] to India, Kingdom of England's [[Henry Hudson]], under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].

===Search for a northern route===
[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]

France, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

In 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were separated by "terrible whirlwinds" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].

====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====
5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.

The following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt; The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.

[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]

The ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.

In 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, "the unknown land of the south") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.

[[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136–246.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luís Vaz de Torres|Luis Váez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del [[Espiritu Santo]]. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].
[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]
[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning "Little Dove"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in "the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands." On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.

In 1642–1644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581–1660)==
{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}
[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]
In the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.

===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===
Around 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.

===Siberian river routes===
In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While [[Cossacks]] came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].

Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.

In 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]
In 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russians reach the Pacific===
In 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.

In 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

[[File:Krsk koch.JPG|upright=0.7|thumb|left|A 17th-century [[Koch (boat)|koch]] in a museum in [[Krasnoyarsk]]. Kochi were the earliest [[icebreaker]]s and were widely used by Russians in the [[Arctic]] and on [[Siberia]]n rivers.]]
In 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].

In 1649–50 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650–53. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).

In 1659–65 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.

So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733–1743.

European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref name="Mayne 2009"&gt;[[#Mayne 2009|Mayne 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.

The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.

Similarly, in coastal Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European [[History of slavery|slave traders]], changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of [[African slave trade|African slavery]], causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland. (See [[Atlantic slave trade]]).

Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50–90% of their population. (See [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cook 1998|Cook 1998]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maize]] and [[Cassava|manioc]] were introduced into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSU 2006|OSU 2006]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scitizen 2007|Scitizen 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred W. Crosby]] speculated that increased production of maize, manioc, and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of population in the areas from which slavers captured their victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th-century economy of China, the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]. China became involved in a new global trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Trade with [[Early modern Europe|European powers]] and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper [[banknote]]s as the common [[medium of exchange]] in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.

New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the Asia's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Columbia University 2009|Columbia University 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the [[Spanish Empire]]. This included [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize]], and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops—wheat, millet, and rice—could not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"&gt;[[#Ebrey 2006|Ebrey 2006]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], pp. 198–201&lt;/ref&gt; In the Song Dynasty (960–1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gernet 1962|Gernet 1962]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the [[Nanban trade|Nanban trade period]], with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City. He taught the Chinese how to construct and play the [[spinet]], translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562–1633) on mathematical work.

As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for [[luxury good]]s stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.

The European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became "the centre of the ''entire'' international economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; and the richest city in Europe at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], "[[Dutch Golden Age]]" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551–1559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.

Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DelftChina18thCenturyCompanieDesIndes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Delftware]] depicting Chinese scenes, 18th century. [[Ernest Cognacq Museum]]]]
From China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly–used synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]—where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;—and ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

[[File:Heem, Jan Davidsz. de - A Richly Laid Table with Parrots - detail cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], detail of silverware from "A Richly Laid Table with Parrots", c. 1650]]

[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559–1636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, [[Manila galleon|transported via Manila]]. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"/&gt;

The increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potosí]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. "I learnt a proverb here", said a French traveller in 1603: "Everything is dear in Spain except silver".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523–25&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial [[middle class]] in Europe, the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.

One effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small land-owing farmers such as [[yeoman]] and gentlemen farmers.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Americas''', also known as '''America''',&lt;ref name=oxfordc&gt;"America." ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'' ({{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}). McArthur, Tom, ed., 1992. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 33: "[16c: from the feminine of ''Americus'', the Latinized first name of the explorer Amerigo Vespucci (1454-1512). A claim is also made for the name of Richard Ameryk, sheriff of Bristol and patron of John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto), the 16c Anglo-Italian explorer of North America. The name ''America'' first appeared on a map in 1507 by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, referring to the area now called Brazil]. Since the 16c, a name of the western hemisphere, often in the plural ''Americas'' and more or less synonymous with ''the New World''. Since the 18c, a name of the United States of America. The second sense is now primary in English: ... However, the term is open to uncertainties: ..."&lt;/ref&gt; are lands of the [[western hemisphere]], composed of numerous entities and regions variably defined by geography, politics, and culture.

The [[Americas]] are recognised in the [[English-speaking world]] to comprise two separate [[continent]]s: [[North America]] and [[South America]]. The Americas are also considered to comprise a single continent named America in parts of Europe, [[Latin America]] and some other areas.&lt;ref name="MoC"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of Continents|author1=Martin W.

* [[United States|United States of America]]—a [[federalism|federal]] [[republic]] in North America founded in 1776 and comprising [[U.S. state|50 states]] (one of which, [[Hawaii]], is not considered to be located in North America) and one federal district (the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]), with [[Political divisions of the United States#Territories of the United States|several outlying territories of varying affiliation]]; commonly referred to as ''the U.S.'' or simply ''America''.
** [[Confederate States of America]]—a former [[confederation]] in North America from 1861 to 1865, comprising eleven [[southern United States|southern states]] that attempted to [[secession|secede]] from the United States of America: [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], and [[Virginia]].  Their rebellion precipitated the [[American Civil War]]; upon its conclusion, the Confederate States were readmitted to representation in the United States Congress.
* [[British America]]—former designation for British possessions in the Americas.
* [[British North America]]—former designation for territories in North America colonised by [[Great Britain]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly after 1783 and in reference to [[Canada]].  At the start of the [[American Revolution]] in 1775, the [[British Empire]] in North America included twenty colonies north of [[Mexico]].  In 1783, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the American Revolution and established boundaries between the [[United States]] and British North America; [[East Florida]] and [[West Florida]] were also ceded to [[Spain]] in the treaty, and then ceded by Spain to the US in 1819.  From 1867 to 1873, all but one of the remaining colonies of British North America [[Canadian Confederation|confederated]] (through a [[British North America Acts|series of eponymous acts]]) into the [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] joined Canada in 1949.
* [[British West Indies]]—the islands and territories of the Caribbean under British colonial influence.
* [[United Provinces of Central America|Federal Republic of Central America]]—formerly the ''United Provinces of Central America'', a federal republic in Central America from 1823 to 1840 comprising the newly independent [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish territories]]: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and (later) [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]].  In 1838, the federation succumbed to [[civil war]] and dissolved.

* [[West Indies Federation]]—a [[federation]] of several Caribbean island [[colony|colonies]] and [[British overseas territory|territories of the United Kingdom]] (''see also: [[British West Indies]]'') from 1958 to 1962.  This was followed by the [[West Indies Associated States]], a smaller, looser polity, from 1967 to 1981.

===Linguistic/cultural regions===
* [[Anglo-America]]—the region of the Americas having significant historical, linguistic, and cultural links to [[England]] or the [[British Isles]], e.g., where [[English language|English]] (a [[Germanic language]]) is officially or primarily spoken; often just Canada and the United States.
* [[Latin America]]—the region of the Americas where [[Romance language]]s derived from [[Latin language|Latin]]–namely [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and variably [[French language|French]]–are officially or primarily spoken. Though French is spoken in [[Quebec]], it is typically not included due to Canada's links to Britain.
** [[Ibero-America]]—the region of the Americas having significant historical, linguistic, and cultural links to [[Spain]] or [[Portugal]] (both on the [[Iberian peninsula]].)
*** [[Hispanic America]] (also [[Spanish America]])—those countries inhabited by Spanish-speaking populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/library/faq/blqzamericas.htm What's the difference between North, Latin, Central, Middle, South, Spanish and Anglo America?]  Geography at about.com. Accessed on line October 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mesoamerica]]—a region of the Americas extending from central Mexico southeast to Nicaragua and Costa Rica; a term used especially in [[archaeology]] and [[ethnohistory]] for the region where an array of civilizations had flourished during the [[pre-Columbian]] era, and which shared a number of historical and cultural traditions.
** [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area]]—a ''[[sprachbund]]'', or linguistic region, defined as the area inhabited by speakers of a set of indigenous languages which have developed certain similarities as a result of their historic and geographical connections; roughly co-terminate with the archaeological/ethnohistorical Mesoamerica.
* [[Aridoamerica]]—an archaeological/ethnohistorical regional division, essentially comprising the arid/semi-arid northern portion of present-day Mexico, whose historical peoples are generally characterised by a nomadic existence and minimal reliance on agriculture.
* [[Oasisamerica]]—an occasionally used archaeological/ethnohistorical term for a (pre-Columbian) cultural region of North America.

The '''clock code''' is a method of mentally computing the [[sine]] of an angle between zero and sixty [[degree (angle)|degrees]]. [[Aviator|Pilot]]s sometimes need to do this to estimate the heading correction due to the wind, and [[sailor]]s may find it useful to do the same thing to allow for the current due to the [[tide]]s.

The basic assumption is that for angles up to around 60°, it is adequately accurate to assume that sine(A) = A, when A is expressed as a fraction of 60. Thus, the sine of 30° = 30/60 = 1/2 = 0.5.

The clock code is a further method of visualising fractions of 60, since we are very used to expressing fractions of an hour (60 minutes) when telling the time.

Thus:

* 10/60 = 1/6 = 0.167 (true sine = 0.1736, error = -4%)
* 15/60 = 1/4 = 0.25 (0.259, -3.4%)
* 20/60 = 1/3 = 0.33 (0.342, -3.5%)
* 30/60 = 1/2 = 0.5 (0.5, 0%)
* 40/60 = 2/3 = 0.66 (0.643, +2.6%)
* 45/60 = 3/4 = 0.75 (0.707, +5.7%)
* 50/60 = 5/6 = 0.8 (0.766, +4.2%)
* 60/60 = 1/1 = 1.0 (0.866, +13.4%)

The angle is the angle of the wind or tide as it presents itself relative to the ship or aircraft, so if the wind is coming from the left at a relative angle of 30°, we use a sine of 0.5. Once the sine has been estimated, the drift due to wind or tide can be estimated accordingly by resolving the velocity of the wind or tide into a forward component and a sideways component. The sideways component is the windspeed x the sine, and the forward component is (1 - the sine) x windspeed (i.e. the [[cosine]]). Naturally we must apply these corrections to our groundspeed in the appropriate  direction according to logic - a wind from the left will blow us off course in that direction; a headwind will slow our progress, a tailwind will increase it. Converting this back to a heading correction can be done using the [[1 in 60 rule]].

For wind angles greater than 60°, it is adequate to assume it's at 90°, i.e. a side wind.

More accurate corrections are done when possible, but in the particular case of a [[Visual flight rules|VFR]] pilot mentally calculating an unexpected diversion, using tables or the [[E6B]] slide rule in flight is usually not an option, so the clock code is one method of handling the required calculation without excessive error. In practice the wind strength can only be guessed or based on earlier reports, and the error due to the sine calculation will usually be much less than that due to the wind itself. Fine tuning of the heading can be done en route using the usual methods for doing so.

A '''county surveyor''' is a public official in many [[County (United States)|counties of the United States]]. At the bottom of this page are working "External Links" as at 4 November 2011 to websites of a selection of such County Surveyor's departments. Most of these officials are elected on the partisan ballot to four-year terms. They administer the county [[Surveying|land survey]] records, re-establish and maintain the [[Survey marker|official government survey monuments]], and review property boundaries surveys and subdivision plans. Other duties vary from state to state. Those marked with an asterisk (*) are nominated by the National Association of County Surveyors (NACS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscounties.org/nacs/index.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919043213/http://www.uscounties.org/nacs/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-19 |title=Welcome to the NACS Web Site |publisher=Uscounties.org |date=2009-02-22 |accessdate=2012-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NACS is part of the National Association of Counties of the USA (NACo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naco.org/Pages/default.aspx |title=The Voice of America's Counties |publisher=NACo |date= |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923064440/http://www.naco.org/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NACo website sets out its perception of the history of county government in the USA, tracing it to Anglo-Saxon England (initial division of land into holdings for government purposes called 'shires', hence 'shire-reeve', the origin of 'sheriff'), Anglo-Norman feudalism (renaming shires conquered by William I as 'counties' and establishing his [[allodial title]] to them via the [[Domesday Book]] survey), and the increasingly "plural executive structure" commissioned by his successors to the royal throne of England to defend the peace and enforce the complex of chivalric, common, and statutory laws of England (and of Wales from the reign of Edward I) up to the time of the first county government established in America ([[James City County, Virginia|County of James City, Virginia]]).&lt;ref&gt;For related references to early county surveyor arrangements in Virginia see {{cite book |title=Kegley's Virginia Frontier: The Beginning of the Southwest : the Roanoke of Colonial Days, 1740-1783 |first=Frederick Bittle |last=Kegley |publisher= originally published Roanoke, Virginia, 1938; reprinted Genealogical Publishing Co.

It was the framework that the King of England applied to his colonies in America and sufficiently successful as to have since been adopted by many other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/HistoryofCountyGovernmentPartI.aspx |title=History of County Government Part I |publisher=Naco.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202050821/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/HistoryofCountyGovernmentPartI.aspx |archivedate=2011-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter V 'The Development of an Extra-Legal Constitution', of 'English Local Government from the Revolution to the Municipal Corporations Act: The Parish and The County' by Sidney Webb and Beatrice Potter Web, describes the increasing chaos that began to prevail within this same period on the 'county surveying' front in England and Wales. Eventually, the military defence component of county surveying in the UK began to separate from the civil in 1791, with the Crown's 'Board of Ordnance' being commissioned to carry out a comprehensive survey of the South Coast of England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/about-us/our-history/index.html |title=About Ordnance Survey, Britain's national mapping agency |publisher=Ordnancesurvey.co.uk |date=2012-09-06 |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005070314/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/about-us/our-history/index.html |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, as a result of 'the last invasion of Britain 1797', at [[Battle of Fishguard|Fishguard]] in South West Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishguardonline.com/last_inv.html |title=Last Invasion |publisher=Fishguardonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately extended to all of the UK. With that shift in emphasis, county surveying began to concentrate more on its civil engineering and civic architecture roles, producing the historically famous British county surveyors such as [[Thomas Telford]], [[John Loudon McAdam]] and [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]];&lt;ref&gt;'The Life and Work of John Nash Architect' Summerson, John: 1980: George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd: England; 'John Nash - A Complete Catalogue': Mansbridge, Michael: 1991: Phaidon Press: London and New York; and 'John Nash Architect-Pensaer': Suggett, Richard: 1995: The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, Aberystwyth; and, The National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth&lt;/ref&gt; the expression, "County Surveyor", became a UK statutory title ([[Bridges Act 1530|Bridges Act 1803]]); and, in England and Wales, its incumbents were appointed by elected councils as of the coming into effect of the [[Local Government Act 1888]] rather than being Crown-appointed by Justices of the Peace.

The UK equivalent of NACS, namely, the County Surveyors Society (CSS) founded in 1885, was subsumed into the pluralistic Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (ADEPT) in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adeptnet.org.uk/ adeptnet.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119151458/http://www.adeptnet.org.uk/ |date=November 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''draft''' or '''draught''' of a ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] is the vertical distance between the [[waterline]] and the bottom of the hull ([[keel]]), with the thickness of the hull included; in the case of not being included the draft outline would be obtained.  Draft determines the minimum depth of water a ship or boat can safely navigate. The draft can also be used to determine the weight of the cargo on board by calculating the total displacement of water and then using [[Archimedes' principle]]. A table made by the shipyard shows the water displacement for each draft. The density of the water (salt or fresh) and the content of the ship's [[Bunkering|bunkers]] has to be taken into account.  The closely related term "trim" is defined as the difference between the forward and aft drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/nomenclature-of-naval-vessels/glossary-of-shipbuilding-terms-s-z.html|title=Glossary of Shipbuilding Terms S-Z|publisher=US Navy Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The draft aft ([[stern]]) is measured in the [[Length between perpendiculars|perpendicular of the stern]].
* The draft forward ([[bow (ship)|bow]]) is measured in the perpendicular of the bow.
* The mean draft is obtained by calculating from the averaging of the stern and bow drafts, with correction for water level variation and value of the position of F{{what|date=October 2016}} with respect to the average perpendicular.{{fact|date=October 2016}}
* The trim of a ship is the difference between the forward and aft draft. When the aft draft is greater the vessel is deemed to have a negative trim, and it has a positive trim when the forward draft is the greater.&lt;ref name="derrett-1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrett|first=Captain D R|title=Ship Stability for Masters and Mates|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Sixth|pages=143–144|chapter=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case it is often referred to as being ''down-by-the-head''.

In commercial ship operations, the ship will usually quote the mean draft as the vessel's draft. However in navigational situations, the maximum draft, usually the aft draft, will be known on the bridge and will be shared with the [[maritime pilot|pilot]]. 

=== Variations ===
The draft of a ship can be affected by multiple factors, not considering the rise and fall of the ship by displacement:
* Variation by trim
* Variation by [[list (watercraft)|list]]
* Variation by [[sea level|water level]] change{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}
* Allowance of fresh water draft variation by passage from fresh to sea water or vice versa
* Heat variation in navigating shallow waters{{fact|date=October 2016}}
* Variation as a result of a ship moving in shallow waters, or [[squat effect|squat]]

== Draft scale ==
The drafts are measured with a "banded" scale, from bow and to stern, and for some ships, the average perpendicular measurement is  also used.  The scale may use traditional English units or metric units.  If the English system ([[Imperial units]]) is used, the bottom of each marking is the draft in feet and markings are 6 inches high.  In metric marking schemes, the bottom of each draft mark is the draft in [[decimeters]] and each mark is one decimeter high.

==Implications==

=== Large ships ===
Larger ships try to maintain an average water draft when they are light (without [[cargo]]), in order to make a better sea crossing and reduce the effects of the wind (high center of velic force). In order to achieve this they use [[sailing ballast]]s to stabilize the ship, following the unloading of cargo.

The water draft of a large ship has little direct link with its stability because stability depends solely on the respective positions of the [[metacenter]] of the hull and the center of gravity. It is also true, however, that a "light" ship has quite high stability which can lead to implying too much rolling of the ship (due to memory). A fully laden ship (with a large draft) can have either a strong or weak stability, depending upon the manner by which the ship is loaded (height of the [[center of gravity]]).

The draft of ships can be increased when the ship is in motion in shallow water, a phenomenon known as [[squat (shipping term)|squat]] (nautical term for the hydrodynamic effect of lower pressure pulling the ship down as it moves).

Draft is a significant factor limiting navigable waterways, especially for large vessels. This includes many shallow coastal waters and reefs, but also some major shipping lanes. [[Panamax]] class ships—the largest ships able to transit the [[Panama Canal]]—do have a draft limit (and an "air draft" limit for passing under bridges) but are usually limited by [[beam (nautical)|beam]], or sometimes [[length overall]],  for fitting into [[lock (water transport)|lock]]s. However, ships can be longer, wider and higher in the [[Suez Canal]], the limiting factor for [[Suezmax]] ships is draft. Some [[supertanker]]s are able to transit the Suez Canal when unladen or partially laden, but not when fully laden.

Canals are not the only draft-limited shipping lanes. A [[Malaccamax]] ship, is the deepest draft able to transit the very busy but relatively shallow [[Strait of Malacca]]. The Strait  only allows ships to have {{convert|.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} more draft than the Suez Canal. [[Capesize]], [[Ultra Large Crude Carrier]]s and a few [[Chinamax]] carriers, are some of the ships that have too deep a draft when laden, for either the Strait of Malacca or the Suez Canal.

=== Pleasure boats ===
A ''small draft'' allows [[pleasure boat]]s to navigate through shallower water. This makes it possible for these boats to access smaller ports, to travel along rivers and even to 'beach' the boat.

A ''large draft'' ensures a good level of stability in strong wind, as the center of gravity is lower (ballast over the keel of the boat). For example: Ballasts placed very low in the keel of a boat such as a [[dragon boat]] with a draft of 1.20 m for a length of 8.90 m.

A boat like a [[catamaran]] can mitigate the problem by retrieving good stability in a small draft, but the width of the boat increases.

=== Submarines ===
For [[submarines]], which can submerge to different depths at sea, a term called [[keel depth]] is used, specifying the current distance from the water surface to the bottom of the submarine's keel.  It is used in navigation to avoid underwater obstacles and hitting the ocean floor, and as a standard point on the submarine for depth measurements.

Submarines usually also have a specified draft used while operating on the surface, for navigating in harbors and at docks.

'''e-Navigation''' is a strategy deveped by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO), a UN specialized agency, to l shipping through better organization of data on ships and on shore, and better data exchange and communication between ships and the ship and shore. The concept was launched when maritime authorities from seven nations requested the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee to add the development of an e-navigation strategy to the work programs of the IMO's NAV and COMSAR sub-committees. Working groups in three sub-committees (NAV, COMSAR and STW) and an intersessional correspondence group, led by Norway, has subsequently developed a Strategy Implementation  Plan (SIP). Member states of IMO and a number of Intergovernmental and non-governmental  organisations have contributed to the work, including  the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO), [[Comité International Radio-Maritime]] (CIRM), the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities]] (IALA), the [[International Chamber of Shipping]] (ICS), the [[Baltic and International Maritime Council]] (BIMCO) and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC)

==Background==

An input paper to IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee’s 81st session in 2005 from Japan, Marshall Islands, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore and the United Kingdom and the United States identified that there was a clear need to equip the master of a vessel, and those responsible for the safety of shipping ashore, with modern proven tools to make marine navigation and communications more reliable and thereby reduce errors − especially those with a potential for loss of life, injury, environmental damage and undue commercial costs.

It also identified that more substantial and widespread benefits for States, shipowners and seafarers could be expected to arise from the increased safety at sea, which was identified as the core objective of e-navigation.

Also according to the United Kingdom’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch, navigational errors and failures, including those of the human element, had been significant in over half of the incidents meriting a full investigation between 2002 and 2005. 
The input paper also noted that accidents related to navigation continue to occur despite the development and availability of a number of ship- and shore-based technologies that improve situational awareness and decision-making. These include the [[Automatic Identification System]] (AIS), [[Electronic Chart Display and Information System]] (ECDIS), [[Integrated bridge system|Integrated Bridge Systems/Integrated Navigation Systems]] (IBS/INS), [[Automatic Radar Plotting Aid]]s (ARPA), radio navigation, [[Long Range Identification and Tracking]] (LRIT) systems, [[Vessel Traffic Service]] (VTS) and the [[Global Maritime Distress Safety System]] (GMDSS).

It was therefore proposed to add a new item on e-navigation to the work programme of the Sub-Committee on Safety of Navigation (NAV) and also to that on Radiocommunications and Search and Rescue (COMSAR). The aim was to develop a strategic vision for the utilization of existing and new navigational tools, in particular electronic tools, in a holistic and systematic manner. e-navigation can thereby help reduce navigational accidents, errors and failures by developing standards for an accurate and cost-effective system that would make a major contribution to the IMO’s agenda of safe, secure and efficient shipping on clean oceans.

===Human Element, Training and Harmonization===

The last decades have seen huge developments in technology within navigation and communication systems. Sophisticated and advanced technology is developing rapidly. Mariners have never had more technological support systems than today and therefore there is a need to coordinate systems and more use of harmonised standards. Although ships now carry Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) and will soon all have reliable Electronic Chart Displays and Information Systems (ECDIS), their use on board is not fully integrated and harmonised with other existing systems and those of other ships and ashore.
At the same time it has been identified that the human element, including training, competency, language skills, workload and motivation are essential in today’s world. Administrative burden, information overload and ergonomics are prominent concerns. A clear need has been identified for the application of good ergonomic principles in a well-structured human machine interface as part of the e-navigation strategy.

===e-Navigation definition===

At MSC 85, the Committee, taking into account inputs from the industry and other relevant organizations (e.g., IALA and IHO), approved the Strategy for the development and implementation of e-navigation and developed the following definition of e-navigation:

''e-navigation is the harmonized collection, integration, exchange, presentation and analysis of marine information on board and ashore by electronic means to enhance berth to berth navigation and related services for safety and security at sea and protection of the marine environment.''

===Benefits for users and stakeholders===

On a global level e-navigation will:
*Standardize bridge design which globally enhances the opportunity to work cross-border, improves efficiency in training and reduces material cost. Similarities between nations and vessels would also increase efficiency and improve safety. 
*Reduce barriers of trade through reduction of local solutions and bureaucracy.  
*Reduce the risk of accidents and incidents.

For Coastal states, Flag states and Port states e-navigation will: 
*Improve efficiency in training, certification and supervision;
*Improve situational awareness by providing easy access to standard and reliable information;
*Improve efficiency in supervision, coordination, control, as well as coordination and information;
*Reduce the risk of accidents and incidents through efficient use of VTS services.

For branches, organizations and industry e-navigation will:
*Provide flexibility with regards to training and rotation as standardization would lead to a more efficient market for standardized bridge products;
*Simplify reporting and thereby reducing the workload for operations;
*Improve safety for own fleet;
*Improve situational awareness for bridge personnel and thereby improving the speed and efficiency of decision making; 
*Increase navigational safety in VTS regulated areas; 
*Provide a direction for product development to a wide market;
*Provide opportunity for new products and solutions;

For ship borne users e-navigation will:
*Simplify daily work and training;
*Improve human-machine interface, usability, familiarity and navigational safety;
*Improve time-saving and efficiency on board by providing easier access to information, thereby improving the response time/problem solving abilities of bridge personnel;
*Improved navigational safety by reducing the administrative workload; 
*Improve confidence in the use of navigational equipment;
*Enhance the quality, accuracy and reliability of information, thereby improving situational awareness and navigational safety;   
*Provide easy access to need-to-know information in a user friendly single window;
*Improve familiarity with systems through standardization;
*Improve service and safety in VTS-regulated areas by providing easy access to available services and warnings  
*Reduce bureaucracy and thereby support more efficient use of bridge resources; 
*Reduce the risk of accidents;

==e-navigation Strategy==

The IMO entrusted Norway and the Norwegian Coastal Administration to coordinate the work of developing a proposal for an e-navigation strategy implementation plan. Three sub-committees within the IMO - NAV, COMSAR and STW - established working groups on e-navigation; each group was chaired by John Erik Hagen of the Norwegian Coastal Administration. Further, a correspondence group overseen by the Norwegian Coastal Administration had an ongoing role in gathering input from national maritime administrations to proposals and decisions related to the process of establishing an e-navigation Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP).

The work on an e-navigation Strategy Implementation Plan was broken down into several clear phases:
#Assessing user needs
#Constructing an open, modular and scalable architecture
#Completing a series of studies: a gap analysis, cost-benefit analysis and a risk analysis

===Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP)===

With these phases complete, five agreed solutions were proposed to provide the basis for a Strategy Implementation Plan. These are:

S1:	improved, harmonized and user friendly bridge design;

S2:	means for standardized and automated reporting;

S3:	improved reliability, resilience and integrity of bridge equipment and navigation information;

S4:	integration and presentation of available information in graphical displays received via communications equipment; and

S9:	improved communication of VTS Service Portfolio.

S1, S3 and S4 address the equipment and its use on the ship, while S2 and S9 address improved communications between ships and ship to shore and shore to ship.
During the development of the SIP a number of tasks have been identified in order to continue the further development and implementation of e-navigation.  Some of these tasks may require further consideration and investigation before taking a final decision on the best way forward and subsequent tasks.
Further it was recognised that there is a need to identify shore-based functions and services. At present, there are many different types of services in most given situations or locations, such as ports, coastal and high seas. Harmonising and standardising these services results in the Maritime Service Portfolios (MSPs).

===Core elements to the Plan===

The final e-Navigation Strategy Implementation Plan contains eight core elements, defined thus:
#Identification of tasks needed to be completed to satisfy the Solutions
#A phasing of the tasks and a high level roadmap
#A list of Maritime Service Portfolios that need to be developed
#A list of key enablers of e-navigation
#The continual assessment of user needs
#Proposals for a systematic assessment of how new technology can best meet defined and evolving user needs in the longer term
#Proposals on public relations and promotion of the e-navigation concept to key stakeholder groups
#Identification of potential sources of funding for development and implementation, particularly for developing regions and countries and of actions to secure that funding.

===Guidelines===
The combination of the five e-navigation solutions, and the three guidelines, ''Guidelines on Human Centred Design (HCD) for e-navigation'', ''Guidelines on Usability Testing, Evaluation and Assessment (U-TEA) for e-navigation systems'' and ''Guidelines for Software Quality Assurance (SQA) in e-navigation'', proposes an e-navigation implementation that facilitates a holistic approach to the interaction between shipboard and shore-based users.

==Way Forward==

The SIP was presented to the new IMO sub-committee NCSR (Navigation Communication Search and Rescue) in June 2014 for endorsement, and forwarded from there to the Maritime Safety Committee where it was approved in November 2014. Along with work taking place under the aegis of the IMO, a number of public and private groups are working to advance e-navigation and topics related to e-navigation.

The '''Earth inductor compass''' (or simply '''induction compass'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2I1JWPpdusC&amp;pg=PA370|quote=induction compass|title=Modern dictionary of electronics|isbn=978-0-7506-9866-5|author1=Graf|first1=Rudolf F|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[compass]] that determines directions using the principle of [[electromagnetic induction]], with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] acting as the [[Electromagnetic induction|induction field]] for an [[electric generator]].&lt;ref name="aero-digest"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldsborough|first=Brice|date=June 1927|title=The Earth inductor compass|url=http://eaavintage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2005-Vol.-33-No.-04-The-Earth-Inductor-Compass.pdf|journal=Aero Digest|publisher=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electrical output of the generator will vary depending on its orientation with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. This variation in the generated voltage is measured, allowing the Earth inductor compass to determine direction.

==History==
The earth inductor compass was first patented by Donald M. Bliss in 1912 and further refined in the 1920s by [[Paul R. Heyl]] and [[Lyman James Briggs]] of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|United States National Bureau of Standards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heyl, P. R.|author2=Briggs, L. J.|title=The earth inductor compass|journal=Proc. Am. Philos. Soc.|volume=61|pages=15–32|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1924 by [[Morris Titterington]] at the [[Pioneer Instrument Company]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Heyl and Briggs were awarded the [[Magellanic Premium|Magellan Medal]] of the [[American Philosophical Society]] for this work in 1922. Designed to compensate for the weaknesses of the [[magnetic compass]], the Earth inductor compass provided pilots with a more stable and reliable reference instrument.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web|title=The Earth Inductor Compass|publisher=Wings Publishing|url=http://www.oldbeacon.com/beacon/earth_inductor_compass.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110083240/http://oldbeacon.com/beacon/earth_inductor_compass.htm|archivedate=2011-01-10|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used in the [[Douglas World Cruiser]]s in 1924 during the [[First aerial circumnavigation|Around-the-World flight]] by the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt; [[Charles Lindbergh]] used the compass on his [[transatlantic flight]] in the [[Spirit of St. Louis]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=Charles A|title=The Spirit of St Louis|year=1953|publisher=Poolbeg Press|isbn=1-85371-912-9|pages=153, 194}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 May 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the transatlantic leg of his voyage - a distance of about {{convert|2000|mi|km}} - he was able to navigate with a cumulative error of about {{convert|10|mi|km}} in landfall, or less than one percent of the distance travelled, by computing his position at hourly intervals by dead reckoning with the induction compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=Charles A|title=The Spirit of St Louis|year=1953|publisher=Poolbeg Press|isbn=1-85371-912-9|pages=153, 194}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 May 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Bliss' original design consisted of two [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]]s spinning on a single vertical axle.  One armature was connected to [[commutator (electric)|commutator]]s that were 90 degrees offset from the commutators connected to the other armature.  When one set of commutators is aligned with the earth's magnetic field no current is produced, but an offset angle creates a positive or negative current in proportion to the sine of the offset angle.  Since the sine of the angle peaks at 90 degrees, a reading could indicate either a certain direction or the exact opposite direction.  The solution to this was a second armature with commutators offset by 90 degrees to help distinguish the two opposite directions.

The direction of travel was read by comparing the indications on two independent [[galvanometer]]s, one for each armature.  The galvanometers had to be calibrated with the correct headings, since the voltage was proportional to the sine of the angle.  Readings could be impacted by the armature's speed of rotation and by stray magnetic fields.

Later versions simplified readings to show the offset from the intended heading, rather than the full range of compass directions.  The revised design allowed the user to rotate the commutators in such a way that zero current would be produced when the craft was traveling in the intended direction.  A single galvanometer was then used to show if the pilot was steering too far to the left or to the right.

Lindberg's compass used an [[anemometer]] to spin the armature through a [[universal joint]].  The armature was mounted on gimbals to prevent it from tilting with the airplane's pitch and roll.  Tilting the armature could have changed the angle of the Earth's flux to the armature, resulting in erroneous readings.  The [[gyroscopic effect]] of the spinning armature also helped to keep it properly aligned.

'''Environmental surveying''' is the title of a profession within the wider field of surveying, the practitioners of which are known as environmental surveyors. Environmental surveyors use [[surveying]] techniques to understand the potential impact of environmental factors on real estate and construction developments, and conversely the impact that [[real estate]] and construction developments will have on the environment.

== Professional activities ==

The exact activities that make up the day-to-day work of an environmental surveyor vary from surveyor to surveyor and from project to project. Two environmental surveyors could have careers that consist of quite different professional activities depending on their and their practices area of specialisation.

In the strictest sense, the field of environmental surveying is distinct from that of environmental consultancy. Environmental consultancies may have some overlap with the work of environmental surveyors, but may be members of different professional bodies and may carry out activities not involving the built environment. They may for example be involved with [[arboriculture]] the specifics of which fall out of the remit of environmental surveyors. The terms are however sometimes used interchangeably, and practices often use the term consultants if the practice is seeking a wider client base than would be attracted to a pure Environmental Surveyor practice.

== Main areas of operation ==

The main areas of operation for environmental surveyors in the UK include:

• [[Flood risk assessmen]]t- This is to assess how likely it is that a building or proposed building will flood. If a building is thought to be at risk it will receive a designation of either Band 1 (200:1 chance of flooding in a year) Band 2 (between 200:1 and 75:1 chance of flooding annually) or Band 3 (greater than  a 75:1 chance of flooding annually, currently thought to account for around 4% of flood risk properties in the UK).

• [[Contaminated land assessmen]]t- Contaminated land surveys are carried out to assess the level of threat posed to existing or proposed buildings. Land can be contaminated if it is on or near a site that is currently or has in the past been used for industrial or waste disposal purposes. Such surveys form part of the due diligence that must be carried out before construction or modification of a real estate asset can begin. Both during and after construction a contaminated land survey could be an important factor in informing risk management strategies.

• [[Environmental screenings]]- Provide a general overview of environmental risks proposed to an existing or proposed real estate development. The screening can help gain a picture of: whether or not the property in question might have been damaged by undermining, whether the property might be susceptible to ground gas, the closeness of government licensed waste disposal facilities and an assessment of a properties water resource vulnerability to contamination.

• [[Fire risk assessment]]- All work premises in the UK must have a fire risk assessment. The assessment is designed to ascertain what could start a fire, how the fire could be dealt with and ensuring that the staff will be sufficiently warned of a fire, have exits from the building and a safe place to congregate afterwards.

• [[Asbestos]] surveys- Because asbestos is extremely dangerous material to the health of humans, its use is strictly controlled. 52 countries globally have now banned the substance. The substance is banned by the [[European Union]], with the exception of its use in a very limited number of specific industrial applications. Because of its widespread use in the building industry before banning, many existing buildings contain asbestos and sites where buildings have been previously may have been contaminated with it. For this reason buildings may need an asbestos survey to ascertain the level of use of the substance and the level of contamination to the site this has resulted in.

== Techniques ==

Environmental Surveyors use a range of techniques to assess the environmental conditions of an area and compile their reports.

• Historical data is drawn from maps and older survey information to establish the exact boundaries of a property, and are also used to see if there has been any historical pollution or waste dumping on the site.

• Water Sampling allows Environmental Surveyors to gain a picture of the quality of and pollution levels in local water sources.

• In a similar way to Water Sampling, Earth Sampling can be used to analyse the level of pollutants in an area’s soil.

• Geometric data may used to establish areas that are likely to flood or monitor the spread of pollutants.

• [[Geographic information system]]s (GISs) can cross reference map data with statistical data. If an Environmental Surveyor was compiling a flood report for a building and wanted to establish the odds of a property flooding in any given year then they could cross reference the geographic location of a property with historically obtained statistical data on flooding in the area.

• Visual Inspection might be used if for example the surveyor wished to establish the level of asbestos contamination to a given property. This might be enhanced by or presented in reference to the collection

== Chartered practitioners ==

In the UK as well as in many other countries globally, recognition by the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] (RICS) is looked upon as conferring a high professional standard, and guaranteeing a level of quality in the work of its member surveyors. Environmental Surveyors form one professional group within RICS and are listed in their Land Professional Group. To achieve the status of chartered environmental surveyor, the candidate must pass an assessment of professional competencies (APC). This consists of completing structured work experience and providing written documents as evidence of the activities carried out during this work experience. Finally the candidate must pass an hour long oral exam. All surveyors regardless of their field are required to demonstrate mastery of RICS core competencies, and then move on to demonstrate knowledge of competencies in their specific fields. Competencies specific to environmental surveying include:

• sustainability 
• contaminated land 
• environmental assessment 
• environmental audit
• laboratory procedures
• management of the natural environment and landscape

Outside of the UK, other professional bodies may offer equivalent designations to signify the professional level of environmental surveyors.
&lt;!--
== Surveyors practices in the UK ==

General surveyors may perform the duties of an environmental surveyor as one of a range of services they supply. If they are a chartered surveyor, they will have completed an APC however it will not be in the specific area of environmental surveying. An example of a practice of this sort would be the London-based.&lt;ref&gt;Dunsin Surveyors&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively small number out of the total number of surveying companies in the UK specialise in environmental surveying. Some practices such as &lt;ref&gt;Wilbourn Associates&lt;/ref&gt; are explicitly a company of Environmental Surveyors, providing the services outlined above. Other companies such as &lt;ref&gt;Kernon Countryside Consultants&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate environmental services into a wider remit of surveying work, in this case rural surveying.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">'''Ex-meridian''' is a [[celestial navigation]] method of calculating an observer’s position on [[Earth]]. The method gives the observer a position line on which the observer is situated. It is usually used when the [[Sun]] is obscured at [[noon]], and as a result, a [[meridian altitude]] is not possible. The navigator measures the altitude of the Sun as close to noon as possible and then calculates where the position line lies.

==Methodology==
This method uses an assumed [[longitude]] and calculates the [[latitude]] that a position line crosses it. The position line obtained is actually part of a [[small circle]], as opposed to [[great circle]], where any observer can stand and the heavenly object would have the same altitude in the sky. When plotting the small segment of this circle on a chart it is drawn as a straight line, the resulting tiny errors are too small to be significant.

The assumed longitude is usually obtained from the DR or Dead Reckoning position run up from a morning sight taken at around 9.00 am. This is worked out by applying the distance from that position either by log or by the estimated speed over time with the course steered. A sight is taken, that is the distance above the horizon of a heavenly object, in this case nearly always the sun, is measured with a [[sextant]] and the exact time noted in [[UTC]]. The sextant angle obtained is corrected for dip (the error caused by the observers height above the sea) and refraction to obtain the true altitude of the object above the horizon. This is then subtracted from 90° to obtain the angular distance from the position directly above, the zenith. This is referred to as the True Zenith Distance. The true zenith distance of the object is also the distance (in arc) on the Earth's surface from the observer to where that object is overhead, the geographical position of the object.

Using a [[nautical almanac]], the [[declination]] (celestial latitude), and the [[Greenwich]] [[hour angle]] (celestial longitude) are obtained of the observed object for the time of observation. The  assumed longitude is now added or subtracted to the Greenwich Hour Angle of the object to obtain the local hour angle, that is the difference in longitude between the DR position and the geographical position of the object.

With this information it is possible using the [[haversine]] formula to calculate the latitude where the position line crosses the assumed longitude. The formula is:

&lt;math&gt;hav(MZD) = hav(TZD) - hav(LHA) cos(Lat) cos(Dec)&lt;/math&gt;

Where

&lt;math&gt;MZD&lt;/math&gt; = Meridian Zenith Distance

&lt;math&gt;TZD&lt;/math&gt; = True Zenith Distance

&lt;math&gt;LHA&lt;/math&gt; = Local Hour Angle

&lt;math&gt;Lat&lt;/math&gt; = DR Latitude

&lt;math&gt;Dec&lt;/math&gt; = Declination

Once the value of the [[meridian (astronomy)|Meridian]] Zenith Distance is obtained the algebraic sum of it with the declination of the object gives the latitude of a point where the position line crosses the meridian of DR longitude.

To draw the position line on a chart the [[azimuth]] or bearing of the heavenly object must be known. It is usually calculated but could have been observed. A line at right angles to the azimuth is drawn through the calculated position which is where the calculated latitude and the DR longitude cross. The observer is somewhere on this line.

To obtain a fix (a position) this line must be crossed with another position line either from another sight or from elsewhere. In the case of ex-meridian the position line is usually crossed with the position line obtained earlier which has been run up.

==Ex-Meridian Tables==
The first of these tables applies corrections to the altitude taken with the argument of ''Change of Altitude in one minute from Meridian Passage''. Two other tables apply more corrections until the correct latitude is arrived at. 

== Accuracy and Versatility ==
The Ex-Meridian method of calculating sights is at its most accurate when the azimuth of the object is near to south or north. As the azimuth changes towards the east or west the cross of the position line with the assumed longitude becomes more and more oblique and the position obtained is therefore less accurate. For this reason it is a less versatile method of calculating sights than the [[intercept method]] which can be used for all azimuths. The tables are a quick and easy way to correct the altitude when the object is fairly low in the sky and the observer has only missed noon by a few minutes but if noon has been missed by more than that or the sun is high in the sky it is better to work out a sight by the intercept method.

A '''garden''' is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, or enjoyment of [[plant]]s and other forms of [[nature]]. The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials. The most common form today is known as a [[residential garden]], but the term ''garden'' has traditionally been a more general one. [[Zoo]]s, which display [[wildlife|wild animals]] in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called ''[[zoological gardens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Garden history : philosophy and design, 2000 BC--2000 AD'', Tom Turner. New York: Spon Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-415-31748-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The earth knows my name : food, culture, and sustainability in the gardens of ethnic Americans'', Patricia Klindienst. Boston: Beacon Press, c2006. {{ISBN|0-8070-8562-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden often signifying a shortened form of ''[[botanical garden]]''. Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as [[Japanese rock garden|Zen gardens]], use plants sparsely or not at all.

Gardens may exhibit structural enhancements, sometimes called [[Folly|follies]], including [[water feature]]s such as [[fountain]]s, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks, dry creek beds, statuary, arbors, trellises and more. Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while some gardens also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants. Food-producing gardens are distinguished from [[farm]]s by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale). Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses.

[[Gardening]] is the activity of growing and maintaining the garden. This work is done by an amateur or professional [[gardener]]. A gardener might also work in a non-garden setting, such as a park, a roadside embankment, or other [[public space]]. [[Landscape architecture]] is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to specialise in design for public and corporate clients.

==Etymology==
[[File:Nicosia historical Municipal gardens in Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|[[Nicosia municipal gardens]], [[Cyprus]]]]
The etymology of the word ''gardening'' refers to '''enclosure''': it is from Middle English ''gardin'', from Anglo-French ''gardin'', ''jardin'', of Germanic origin; akin to Old High German ''gard'', ''gart'', an enclosure or compound, as in [[Stuttgart]]. See [[Grad (Slavic settlement)]] for more complete etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garden |title=Etymology of the modern word gardin |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Merriam Webster]] |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''yard'', ''court'', and Latin ''hortus'' (meaning "garden," hence horticulture and orchard), are cognates—all referring to an enclosed space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/garden.html |title=Etymology of words referring to enclosures, probably from a Sanskrit stem. In German, for example, Stutt'''gart'''. The word is generic for compounds and walled cities, as in Stalin'''grad''', and the Russian word for city, ''gorod''. Gird and girdle are also related |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Yourdictionary.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213101107/http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/garden.html |archivedate=2010-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "garden" in [[British English]] refers to a small enclosed area of land, usually adjoining a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/garden?view=uk|title=Oxford Dictionaries - The World's Most Trusted Dictionary Provider|website=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be referred to as a [[yard (land)|yard]] in [[American English]].

==Garden design==
{{Main|Garden design}}

Garden design is the creation of plans for the layout and planting of gardens and landscapes. Gardens may be designed by garden owners themselves, or by professionals. Professional garden designers tend to be trained in principles of design and horticulture, and have a knowledge and experience of using plants. Some professional garden designers are also [[landscape architect]]s, a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license.

Elements of garden design include the layout of hard landscape, such as paths, rockeries, walls, water features, sitting areas and decking, as well as the plants themselves, with consideration for their [[horticultural]] requirements, their season-to-season appearance, lifespan, [[Habit (biology)|growth habit]], size, speed of growth, and combinations with other plants and landscape features.  Consideration is also given to the maintenance needs of the garden, including the time or funds available for regular maintenance, which can affect the choices of plants regarding speed of growth, spreading or self-seeding of the plants, whether [[Annual plant|annual]] or [[Perennial plant|perennial]], and bloom-time, and many other characteristics. Garden design can be roughly divided into two groups, formal and naturalistic gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Gang|title=Planting design illustrated|year=2010|publisher=Outskirts Press, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4327-4197-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1z9wlhscZFgC|edition=2nd|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important consideration in any garden design is, how the garden will be used, followed closely by the desired stylistic genres, and the way the garden space will connect to the home or other structures in the surrounding areas.  All of these considerations are subject to the limitations of the budget. Budget limitations can be addressed by a simpler garden style with fewer plants and less costly hardscape materials, seeds rather than sod for lawns, and plants that grow quickly; alternatively, garden owners may choose to create their garden over time, area by area.

Most gardens consist of a mix of natural and constructed elements, although even very 'natural' gardens are always an inherently artificial creation. Natural elements present in a garden principally comprise flora (such as trees and [[weed]]s), fauna (such as [[arthropod]]s and birds), soil, water, air and light. Constructed elements include paths, patios, decking, sculptures, [[drainage]] systems, lights and buildings (such as [[shed]]s, [[gazebo]]s, [[pergola]]s and [[Folly|follies]]), but also living constructions such as flower beds, ponds and [[lawn]]s.

==Environmental impacts of gardens==
Gardeners may cause environmental damage by the way they garden, or they may enhance their local environment.
Damage by gardeners can include direct [[Habitat destruction|destruction of natural habitats]] when houses and gardens are created; indirect [[habitat destruction]] and damage to provide garden materials such as [[peat]], rock for rock gardens, and by the use of tapwater to irrigate gardens; the death of living beings in the garden itself, such as the killing not only of [[slug]]s and [[snail]]s but also their predators such as [[hedgehog]]s and [[song thrush]]es by [[metaldehyde]] slug killer; the death of living beings outside the garden, such as local species extinction by indiscriminate [[Plant collecting|plant collectors]]; and [[climate change]] caused by [[greenhouse gas]]es produced by gardening.

==Watering gardens==
Some gardeners manage their gardens without using any water from outside the garden, and therefore do not deprive wetland habitats of the water they need to survive. Examples in Britain include [[Ventnor Botanic Garden]] on the Isle of Wight, and parts of [[Beth Chatto]]'s garden in Essex, Sticky Wicket garden in Dorset, and the Royal Horticultural Society's gardens at [[RHS Garden Harlow Carr|Harlow Carr]] and [[RHS Hyde Hall|Hyde Hall]].
[[Rain garden]]s absorb rainfall falling onto nearby hard surfaces, rather than sending it into stormwater drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunnett and Clayden|first=Nigel and Andy|title=Rain Gardens:  Managing Water Sustainably in the Garden and Designed Landscape|year=2007|publisher=Timber Press|location=Portland, Oregon, USA|isbn=978-0881928266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For irrigation, see [[rainwater]], [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler system]], [[drip irrigation]], [[tap water]], [[greywater]], [[hand pump]] and [[watering can]].

==Climate change and gardens==
Climate change will have many impacts on gardens, most of them negative, and these are detailed in 'Gardening in the Global Greenhouse' by Richard Bisgrove and Paul Hadley.&lt;ref name="Bisgrove and Hadley (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bisgrove and Hadley|first=Richard and Paul|title=Gardening in the Global Greenhouse: The impacts of climate change on gardens in the UK|year=2002|publisher=UK Climate Impacts Programme|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardens also contribute to climate change. Greenhouse gases can be produced by gardeners in many ways. The three main [[greenhouse gas]]es are [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and [[nitrous oxide]]. Gardeners produce carbon dioxide directly by [[Tillage#Negative|overcultivating]] soil and destroying soil carbon, by burning garden 'waste' on [[Bonfire#Farm and garden bonfires|bonfires]], by using [http://gardenreviewers.com power tools] which burn [[fossil fuel]] or use electricity generated by fossil fuels, and by using [[peat]]. Gardeners produce methane by compacting the soil and making it anaerobic, and by allowing their [[compost heap]]s to become compacted and anaerobic. Gardeners produce nitrous oxide by applying excess [[Fertilizer#Inorganic fertilizers (mineral fertilizer)|nitrogen fertiliser]] when plants are not actively growing so that the nitrogen in the fertiliser is converted by [[Nitrous oxide#Soil|soil bacteria]] to nitrous oxide.
Gardeners can help to prevent climate change in many ways, including the use of trees, shrubs, [[Ground cover|ground cover plants]] and other perennial plants in their gardens, turning garden 'waste' into [[soil organic matter]] instead of burning it, keeping soil and compost heaps aerated, avoiding peat, switching from power tools to hand tools or changing their garden design so that power tools are not needed, and using [[Nitrogen-fixing#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing]] plants instead of nitrogen fertiliser.&lt;ref name="David S.Ingram, Daphne Vince-Prue and Peter J. Gregory (2008)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingram, Vince-Prue, and Gregory (editors)|first=David S., Daphne, and Peter J.|title=Science and the Garden: The scientific basis of horticultural practice|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=9781405160636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other similar spaces==
Other outdoor spaces that are similar to gardens include:
* A [[landscape]] is an outdoor space of a larger scale, natural or designed, usually unenclosed and considered from a distance.
* A [[park]] is a planned outdoor space, usually enclosed ('imparked') and of a larger size. [[Public park]]s are for public use.
* An [[arboretum]] is a planned outdoor space, usually large, for the display and study of [[tree]]s.
* A [[farm]] or [[orchard]] is for the production of [[food]] stuff.
* A [[botanical garden]] is a type of garden where plants are grown both for scientific purposes and for the enjoyment and education of visitors.
* A zoological garden, or [[zoo]] for short, is a place where wild animals are cared for and exhibited to the public.
* A [[Kindergarten]] is a preschool educational institution for children and in the very sense of the word should have access or be part of a garden.
* A [[Männergarten]] is a temporary day-care and activities space for men in German-speaking countries while their wives or girlfriends go  [[shopping]]. Historically, the expression has also been used for gender-specific sections in lunatic asylums, monasteries and clinics.&lt;ref&gt;See: Jakob Fischel, ''Prag's K. K.

The '''Geographical Names Board of Canada''' ('''GNBC''') is a national committee with a secretariat in [[Natural Resources Canada]], part of the [[Government of Canada]], which authorizes the names used on official federal government maps of [[Canada]] created since 1897. The board consists of 27 members, one from each of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]], and others from departments of the [[Government of Canada]]. The board also is involved with names of areas in the [[Antarctic]] through the [[Antarctic Treaty]].

==Structure==
The [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] is provided by [[Natural Resources Canada]]. In addition to the provincial and territorial members are members from the following federal government departments: [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]], [[Canada Post Corporation]], [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]], [[Elections Canada]], [[Library and Archives Canada]], [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]], Natural Resources Canada (including [[Geological Survey of Canada]] and [[Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation]]), [[Parks Canada]], [[Statistics Canada]], and the [[Translation Bureau]]. The Chair of the Geographical Names Board of Canada is Connie Wyatt Anderson from The Pas, Manitoba.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2887">'''Geoparsing''' is the process of converting free-text descriptions of places (such as "twenty miles northeast of Jalalabad") into unambiguous geographic identifiers, such as [[geographic coordinates]] expressed as [[latitude]]-[[longitude]]. One can also geoparse location references from other forms of media, for examples audio content in which a speaker mentions a place. With geographic coordinates the features can be mapped and entered into [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]]. Two primary uses of the geographic coordinates derived from unstructured content are to plot portions of the content on maps and to search the content using a map as a filter.

Geoparsing goes beyond [[geocoding]]. Geocoding analyzes unambiguous structured location references, such as postal addresses and rigorously formatted numerical coordinates. Geoparsing handles ambiguous references in unstructured discourse, such as "Al Hamra," which is the name of several places, including towns in both Syria and Yemen.

A '''geoparser''' is a piece of software or a (web) service that helps in this process.

The '''Global Earth Observation System of Systems''' ('''GEOSS''') is being built{{needs update|date=June 2018}} by the [[Group on Earth Observations]] (GEO) on the basis of a 10-Year Implementation Plan running from 2005 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/geoss/ US Environmental Protection Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; GEOSS seeks to connect the producers of environmental data and decision-support tools with the end users of these products, with the aim of enhancing the relevance of Earth observations to [[global issue]]s. GEOSS aims to produce a global public infrastructure that generates comprehensive, near-real-time environmental data, information and analyses for a wide range of users. The Secretariat Director of Geoss is Barbara Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthobservations.org/ag_geosec_d.shtml Group on Earth Observations &amp;mdash; The GEO Secretariat Director] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010224031/http://www.earthobservations.org/ag_geosec_d.shtml |date=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earth observation systems ==
[[Earth observation]] systems consist of instruments and models designed to measure, monitor and predict the physical, chemical and biological aspects of the Earth system. Buoys floating in the oceans monitor temperature and salinity; meteorological stations and balloons record air quality and rainwater trends; sonar and radar systems estimate fish and bird populations; seismic and [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) stations record movements in the Earth’s crust and interior; some 60-plus high-tech environmental satellites scan the planet from space; powerful computerized models generate simulations and forecasts; and early warning systems issue alerts to vulnerable populations.

These various systems have typically operated in isolation from one another. In recent years, however, sophisticated new technologies for gathering vast quantities of near-real-time and high-resolution Earth observation data have become operational. At the same time, improved forecasting models and decision-support tools are increasingly allowing decision makers and other users of Earth observations to fully exploit this widening stream of information.

With investments in Earth observations now reaching a critical mass, it has become possible to link diverse observing systems together to paint a full picture of the Earth’s condition. Because the costs and logistics of expanding Earth observations are daunting for any single nation, linking systems together through international cooperation also offers cost savings.

==Implementation==
As a networked system, GEOSS is owned by all of the GEO Members and Participating Organizations. Partners maintain full control of the components and activities that they contribute to the system of systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/geo/article_2450_en.htm European Commission]
&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation is being pursued through a Work Plan consisting of over 70 tasks. Each task supports one of the nine societal-benefit or four transverse areas and is carried out by interested Members and Participating Organizations. Governments and organizations have also advanced GEOSS by contributing a variety of “Early Achievements”; these “First 100 Steps to GEOSS” were presented to the 2007 Cape Town Ministerial Summit.

Interlinking observation systems requires common standards for architecture and data sharing. The architecture of an Earth observation system refers to the way in which its components are designed so that they function as a whole. Each GEOSS component must be included in the GEOSS registry and configured so that it can communicate with the other participating systems. In addition, each contributor to GEOSS must subscribe to the GEO data-sharing principles, which aim to ensure the full and open exchange of data, metadata and products. These issues are fundamental to the successful operation of GEOSS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directionsmag.com/editorials.php?article_id=2026&amp;trv=1 Directions Magazine]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grss-ieee.org/menu.taf?menu=geoss&amp;detail=Standards Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geossregistries.info/ GEOSS Registries]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/45609/story.htm Reuters]
&lt;/ref&gt;

GEOSS will disseminate information and analyses directly to users. GEO is developing the GEOPortal as a single Internet gateway to the data produced by GEOSS. The purpose of GEOPortal is to make it easier to integrate diverse data sets, identify relevant data and portals of contributing systems, and access models and other decision-support tools. For users without good access to high-speed internet, GEO has established GEONETCast, a system of four communications satellites that transmit data to low-cost receiving stations maintained by the users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Nov27/0,4670,ObservingEarth,00.html Associated Press]
&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, GEONETCast seems still in its infancy, yet some tools have already been worked out. The [http://www.itc.nl/Pub/Organization/Geonetcast-Toolbox.html GEONETCast toolbox] has been made available and contains tools to access some radar altimetry, vegetation, satellite prediction and maritime information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itc.nl/PDF/Organisation/Scientific%20departments/WRS/other_tools.pdf Information available through GEONETCast]&lt;/ref&gt; Other useful information available through GEONETCast is vegetation and desert locust information provided under the DevCoCast project, which is a subproject of GEONETCast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devcocast.eu/ViewContent.do?pageId=130 Useful data from DevCoCast project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://endeleo.vgt.vito.be/ ENDELEO, a useful vegetation map allowing comparison of vegetation over time, part of "Kenyan Forests" DevCoCast project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==User groups==
The growing demand for Earth observation data and information is the driving force behind GEOSS. The GEOSS Implementation Plan identifies nine distinct groups of users and uses, which it calls “[[Societal Benefit Areas]]”. The nine areas are disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity. Current and potential users include decision makers in the public and private sectors, resource managers, planners, emergency responders and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gbif.org/Events/geoss2006 Global Biodiversity Information Facility]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geoss-ecp.org/ GEO Energy Community of Practice]

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1205/p06s02-woaf.html The Christian Science Monitor]
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related initiatives ==
GEOSS can be characterized as a contribution towards the establishment of a [[spatial data infrastructure]]. 
It is one of three related initiatives that are the subject of the GIGAS (GEOSS, [[Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community|INSPIRE]] and [[Copernicus Programme|GMES]] an Action in Support) harmonization project under the auspices of the [[European Union|EU]] [[7th Framework Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegigasforum.eu/project/project.html The GIGAS Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4363">'''Global Maritime Situational Awareness''' ('''GMSA''') is defined in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111004213300/http://www.gmsa.gov/twiki/bin/view/Main/MDAConOps U.S. National Concept of Operations for Maritime Domain Awareness, December 2007], as "the comprehensive fusion of data from every agency and by every nation to improve knowledge of the maritime domain." It is an integral element of [[Maritime Domain Awareness|Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA)]].

Essentially, no one country, department, or agency holds all of the authorities and capabilities to have effective Maritime Domain Awareness on its own. However, by combining separate pieces of information from agencies at the federal, state, local, and tribal level around the world with information from the maritime industry and other non-governmental organizations, it is possible to keep track of the status of every ocean-bound and sea-bound vessel. GMSA results from combining intelligence given by other regions of the world into a complete picture for identifying trends and detecting anomalies.

== Development of GMSA in the U.S. ==
In the United States, the director for GMSA is responsible for managing data critical to building the situational awareness component of global MDA. The director also develops and recommends policy guidance for coordinated collection, fusion, analysis, and dissemination of GMSA information and products, as well as information integration policies, protocols and standards. The director also recommends improvements to situational
awareness-related activities supporting maritime information collection, fusion, analysis and
dissemination. The director co-chairs the U.S. National MDA Stakeholder Board, sits on the MDA Stakeholder Board Executive Steering Committee, and is a member of the U.S. Maritime Security Policy Coordinating Committee (MSPCC).

The GMSA staff consists of and is supported by dedicated subject matter experts from across the federal government as selected by the Director from departmental nominees from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[Director of National Intelligence]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], [[Department Of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy's]] [[National Nuclear Security Administration]].

The GMSA Director and staff form the [[Office of Global Maritime Situational Awareness#External links|Office of Global Maritime Situational Awareness.]]

==Maritime anomaly detection==
Maritime anomaly detection is an area of scientific study aimed at avoiding maritime collisions. There are a number of aspects to this work, and there have been several conferences and workshops exploring the domain. A google search on "Maritime anomaly detection" returns a large number of hits from a wide range of domains. Some of the related topics are:
*Maritime anomaly detection and situation awareness
*Maritime anomaly detection and [[threat assessment]]
*Visual analytics for maritime anomaly detection 
Some of the significant events exploring the area are:
*The International Workshop on Maritime Anomaly Detection - MAD 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://mad.uvt.nl/ The International Workshop on Maritime Anomaly Detection] (MAD 2011), Tilburg, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

This is achieved by casting surface points of the sphere onto a [[tangent]] plane, each landing where a ray from the center of the sphere passes through the point on the surface and then on to the plane. No distortion occurs at the tangent point, but distortion increases rapidly away from it. Less than half of the [[sphere]] can be projected onto a finite map. Consequently, a [[Rectilinear lens|rectilinear photographic lens]], which is based on the gnomonic principle, cannot image more than 180 degrees.

==History==
The gnomonic [[Map projection|projection]] is said to be the oldest map projection, developed by [[Thales]] in the 6th century BC.
The path of the shadow-tip or light-spot in a [[sundial#Nodus-based sundials|nodus-based sundial]] traces out the same [[hyperbola]]e formed by parallels on a gnomonic map.

==Properties==
Since [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] and the [[equator]] are great circles, they are always shown as straight lines on a gnomonic map.

*If the tangent point is one of the [[Geographical pole|poles]] then the meridians are radial and equally spaced. The equator is at [[infinity]] in all directions. Other [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] are depicted as concentric [[circle]]s.
*If the tangent point is not on a pole or the equator, then the meridians are radially outward straight lines from a Pole, but not equally spaced. The equator is a straight line that is perpendicular to only one meridian, indicating that the projection is not [[conformal map|conformal]]. Other parallels are depicted as [[conic section]]s.
*If the tangent point is on the equator then the meridians are parallel but not equally spaced. The equator is a straight line perpendicular to the meridians. Other parallels are depicted as [[hyperbola]]e.

[[Image:Gnomonic.png|thumb|right|300px|Great circles transform to straight lines via gnomonic projection]]

As with all [[azimuth]]al projections, angles from the tangent point are preserved. The map distance from that point is a function ''r''(''d'') of the true distance ''d'', given by

:&lt;math&gt; r(d) = R\,\tan \frac d R&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the radius of the Earth. The radial scale is

:&lt;math&gt; r'(d) = \frac{1}{\cos^2\frac d R} &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[:wikt:transverse|transverse]] scale

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\cos\frac d R} &lt;/math&gt;

so the transverse scale increases outwardly, and the radial scale even more.

==Use==
Gnomonic projections are used in [[seismic]] work because seismic waves tend to travel along great circles. They are also used by [[navy|navies]] in plotting [[direction finding]] bearings, since [[radio]] signals travel along great circles. [[Meteor]]s also travel along great circles, with the Gnomonic [[Atlas Brno 2000.0]] being the [[International Meteor Organization|IMO]]'s recommended set of star charts for visual meteor observations. Aircraft and ship pilots use the projection to find the shortest route between start and destination.

The gnomonic projection is used extensively in [[photography]], where it is called ''[[Rectilinear lens|rectilinear]] projection''.

The gnomonic projection is used in astronomy where the tangent point is centered on the object of interest.  The sphere being projected in this case is the celestial sphere, ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,  and not the surface of the Earth.

'''Hydrographic survey''' is the science of measurement and description of features which affect maritime navigation, marine construction, [[dredging]], [[Hydrocarbon exploration|offshore oil exploration]]/[[offshore oil drilling]] and related activities. Strong emphasis is placed on soundings, shorelines, tides, currents, [[seabed]] and submerged obstructions that relate to the previously mentioned activities.  The term ''hydrography'' is used synonymously to describe ''maritime [[cartography]]'', which in the final stages of the hydrographic process uses the raw data collected through hydrographic survey into information usable by the [[end user]].

[[Hydrography]] is collected under rules which vary depending on the acceptance authority.  Traditionally conducted by ships with a [[sounding line]] or  [[echo sounding]], surveys are increasingly conducted with the aid of aircraft and sophisticated electronic sensor systems in shallow waters.

==Organizations==

===National and International Maritime Hydrography===
{{main|Hydrographic office}}
Hydrographic offices evolved from naval heritage and are usually found within national naval structures, for example Spain's Instituto Hidrográfico de la Marina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/ciencia_ihm_1/ | Armada Esapñola - Instituto Hidrográfico de la Marina&lt;/ref&gt;  Coordination of those organizations and product standardization is voluntarily joined with the goal of improving hydrography and safe navigation is conducted by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO). The IHO publishes Standards and Specifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/standards-publications/introduction.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155623/http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/standards-publications/introduction.html |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }} | IHO Catalogue of Publications&lt;/ref&gt; followed by its Member States as well as Memoranda of Understanding and Co-operative Agreements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/letters-and-documents/mou-agreements.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410145023/http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/letters-and-documents/mou-agreements.html |archivedate=10 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }} | IHO Memoranda of Understanding and Co-operative Agreements&lt;/ref&gt; with hydrographic survey interests.

The product of such hydrography is most often seen on nautical charts published by the national agencies and  required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/safety/mainframe.asp?topic_id=350 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415030816/http://www.imo.org/Safety/mainframe.asp?topic_id=350 |archivedate=15 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }} | IMO&lt;/ref&gt; the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomia.com/technical-info/docs/SOLASV.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206011442/http://icomia.com/technical-info/docs/SOLASV.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }} | SOLAS CHAPTER V SAFETY OF NAVIGATION&lt;/ref&gt; and national regulations to be carried on vessels for safety purposes. Increasingly those charts are provided and used in electronic form unders IHO standards.

===Hydrographic survey conducted by non-national agencies===
Governmental entities below the national level conduct or contract for hydrographic surveys for waters within their jurisdictions with both internal and contract assets. Such surveys commonly are conducted by national [[hydrographic office|organizations]] or under their supervision or the standards they have approved, particularly when the use is for the purposes of chart making and distribution or the [[dredging]] of state-controlled waters.

In the United States, there is coordination with the National Hydrography Dataset in survey collection and publication.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/maps/gis/datahydro.html | Wisconsin DNR - Surface Water (Hydrography) Data - Conversion from Coverage to Geodatabase&lt;/ref&gt; State environmental organizations publish hydrographic data relating to their mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/water/tmdl/hydromaps.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125231253/http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/water/tmdl/hydromaps.html |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }} | Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - Hydrography Maps and Data&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrographic survey by private organizations ===
Commercial entities also conduct large-scale hydrographic and [[Geophysics|geophysical]] surveying, particularly in the dredging, marine construction, [[oil exploration]], and drilling industries. Industrial entities installing submarine communications cables&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setech-uk.com/pdf/Paper2.pdf HYDROGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND THE SUBMARINE CABLE INDUSTRY&lt;/ref&gt; or power&lt;ref&gt;http://sanpedrosun.net/old/belcable.html | BEL submarine cable survey complete&lt;/ref&gt; require detailed surveys of cable routes prior to installation and increasingly use acoustic imagery equipment previously found only in military applications when conducting their surveys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id2826-Utec_Surveyor_Equipped_for_Deep_Ocean_Cable_Route_Surveys.html | Utec Surveyor Equipped for Deep Ocean Cable Route Surveys&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized companies exist that haveboth the equipment and expertise to contract with both commercial and governmental entities to perform such surveys .

Companies, universities, and investment groups will often fund hydrographic surveys of public waterways prior to developing areas adjacent those waterways. Survey firms are also contracted to survey in support of design and engineering firms that are under contract for large public projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id3583-Infrastructure_Survey_in_Turkey.html | Infrastructure Survey in Turkey 14 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Private surveys are also conducted before dredging operations and after these operations are completed.  Companies with large private slips, docks, or other waterfront installations have their facilities and the open water near their facilities surveyed regularly, as do islands in areas subject to variable erosion such as in the Maldives.

== Hydrographic survey by crowdsourcing ==
[[Crowdsourcing]] also is entering hydrographic surveying, with projects such as [[OpenSeaMap]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openseamap.org/fileadmin/user_upload/inhalt/PDF/Artikel_Hydro_International-2013-02.pdf|title=Hydro International: Water Depths by Crowdsourcing|author=|date=|website=openseamap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.teamsurv.eu TeamSurv] and ARGUS. Here, volunteer vessels record position, depth, and time data using their standard navigation instruments, and then the data is post-processed to account for speed of sound, tidal, and other corrections. With this approach there is no need for a specific survey vessel, or for professionally qualified surveyors to be on board, as the expertise is in the data processing that occurs once the data is uploaded to the server after the voyage. Apart from obvious cost savings, this also gives a continuous survey of an area, but the drawbacks are time in recruiting observers and getting a high enough density and quality of data. Although sometimes accurate to 0.1 - 0.2m, this approach cannot substitute for a rigorous systematic survey, where this is required.  Nevertheless, the results are often more than adequate for many requirements where high resolution, high accuracy surveys are not required or are unaffordable.

==Methods==

===Lead lines, sounding poles, and single-beam echosounders===

The history of hydrographic surveying dates almost as far back as that of [[sailing]].&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/hydro_history.html|title=Page Not Found - Office of Coast Survey|author=|date=|website=www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many centuries, a hydrographic survey required the use of lead lines &amp;ndash; ropes or lines with depth markings attached to lead weights to make one end sink to the bottom when lowered over the side of a ship or boat &amp;ndash; and sounding poles, which were poles with depth markings which could be thrust over the side until they touched bottom. In either case, the depths measured had to be read manually and recorded, as did the position of each measurement with regard to mapped reference points as determined by three-point [[sextant]] fixes. The process was labor-intensive and time-consuming and, although each individual depth measurement could be accurate, even a thorough survey as a practical matter could include only a limited number of sounding measurements relative to the area being surveyed, inevitably leaving gaps in coverage between single soundings.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt;

Single-beam [[echosounder]]s and fathometers began to enter service in the 1930s which used [[sonar]] to measure the depth beneath a vessel. This greatly increased the speed of acquiring sounding data over that possible with lead lines and sounding poles by allowing information on depths beneath a vessel to be gathered in a series of lines spaced at a specified distance. However, it shared the weakness of earlier methods by lacking depth information for areas in between the strips of sea bottom the vessel sounded.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt;

===Wire-drag surveying===

[[File:Wire drag operations.jpg|300px|left|thumb|A [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] diagram of wire-drag hydrographic survey operations, ca. 1920. The basic principle is to drag a wire attached to two vessels at a set depth; if the wire encounters an obstruction it will come taut and form a "V," indicating the location of an obstruction at that depth.]]In 1904, wire-drag surveys were introduced into hydrography, and the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]]′s [[Nicholas H. Heck]] played a prominent role in developing and perfecting the technique between 1906 and 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/cgsbios/bioh14.html|title=NOAA History - Profiles in Time/C&amp;GS Biographies - Captain Nicholas H. Heck|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wire-drag method, a wire attached to two ships or boats and set at a certain depth by a system of weights and buoys was dragged between two points. If the wire encountered an obstruction, it would become taut and form a "V" shape. The location of the "V" revealed the position of submerged rocks, wrecks, and other obstructions, while the depth at which the wire was set showed the depth at which the obstruction was encountered.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt; This method revolutionized hydrographic surveying, as it allowed a quicker, less laborious, and  far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and sounding poles.

Prior to the advent of [[sidescan sonar]], wire-drag surveying was the only method for searching large areas for obstructions and lost vessels and aircraft.&lt;ref name="heck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/heck.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/HECK|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1906 and 1916, Heck expanded the capability of wire-drag systems from a relatively limited area to sweeps covering channels two to three [[nautical mile]]s (3.7 to 5.6 km) in width.&lt;ref name=NOAA200WireDrag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/hydro_survey/welcome.html#techni|title=Breakthrough article on Hydrographic Survey Techniques|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|last=Administration|date=|website=celebrating200years.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wire-drag technique was a major contribution to hydrographic surveying during much of the rest of the 20th century. So valuable was wire-drag surveying in the United States that for decades the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and later the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, fielded a pair of [[sister ship]]s of identical design specifically to work together on such surveys. [[USC&amp;GS Marindin|USC&amp;GS ''Marindin'']] and [[USC&amp;GS Ogden|USC&amp;GS ''Ogden'']] conducted wire-drag surveys together from 1919 to 1942, [[USC&amp;GS Hilgard (ASV 82)|USC&amp;GS ''Hilgard'' (ASV 82)]] and [[USC&amp;GS Wainwright (ASV 83)|USC&amp;GS ''Wainwright'' (ASV 83)]] took over from 1942 to 1967, and USC&amp;GS ''Rude'' (ASV 90) (later [[NOAAS Rude (S 590)|NOAAS ''Rude'' (S 590)]]) and USC&amp;GS ''Heck'' (ASV 91) (later [[NOAAS Heck (S 591)|NOAAS ''Heck'' (S 591)]]) worked together on wire-drag operations from 1967.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/marindin.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/MARINDIN|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/ogden.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/OGDEN|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/hilgard.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/HILGARD|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rude"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/rude.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/RUDE|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heck"/&gt;

The rise of new electronic technologies &amp;ndash; sidescan sonar and multibeam swath systems &amp;ndash; in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s eventually made the wire-drag system obsolete. Sidescan sonar could create images of underwater obstructions with the same fidelity as [[aerial photography]], while multibeam systems could generate depth data for 100 percent of the bottom in a surveyed area. These technologies allowed a single vessel to do what wire-drag surveying required two vessels to do, and wire-drag surveys finally came to an end in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOAA200WireDrag/&gt; Vessels were freed from working together on wire-drag surveys, and in the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), for example, ''Rude'' and ''Heck'' operated independently in their later years.&lt;ref name="rude"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heck"/&gt;

===Modern surveying===
[[File:Sonar operations by survey ship.jpg|thumb|Graphic depicting NOAA hydrographic survey ship conducting multibeam and side scan sonar operations]]

In suitable shallow-water areas [[lidar]] (light detection and ranging) may be used.&lt;ref Name=nhsptxt&gt;http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/docs/NHSP_2009_TextOnly.pdf | NOAA Hydrographic Survey Priorities 2009 Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Equipment can be installed on inflatable craft, such as [[Zodiac Group#Zodiac Boat|Zodiacs]], small craft, [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUVs), [[unmanned underwater vehicle]]s (UUVs) or large ships, and can include sidescan, single-beam and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070209015914/http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/hsd/wrecks.htm multibeam] equipment. At one time different data collection methods and standards were used in collecting hydrographic data for maritime safety and for scientific or engineering [[bathymetric]] charts, but increasingly, with the aid of improved collection techniques and computer processing, the data is collected under one standard and extracted for specific use.

After data is collected, it has to undergo post-processing.  A massive amount of data is collected during the typical hydrographic survey, often several soundings per [[square foot]]. Depending on the final use intended for the data (for example, [[navigation chart]]s, [[Digital Terrain Model]], volume calculation for [[dredging]], [[topography]], or [[bathymetry]]) this data must be thinned out. It must also be corrected for errors (i.e., bad soundings,) and for the effects of [[tides]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070325091416/http://www.thsoa.org/hy03/3a_3.pdf waves]/[https://web.archive.org/web/20070614123051/http://chl.erdc.usace.army.mil/library/publications/chetn/pdf/cetn-vi-17.pdf heave], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070324014031/http://www.hydrographicsociety.org/Articles/journal/2002/104-3.htm water level] and [[thermocline]]s (water temperature differences). Usually the surveyor has additional data collection equipment on site to record the data required for correcting the soundings. The final output of charts can be created with a combination of specialty charting software or a [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) package, usually [[Autocad]].

Although the accuracy of crowd-sourced surveying can rarely reach the standards of traditional methods, the [[algorithm]]s used rely on a high data density to produce final results that are more accurate than single measurements. A comparison of crowd-sourced surveys with multibeam surveys indicates an accuracy of crowd-sourced surveys of around plus or minus 0.1 to 0.2 meter (about 4 to 8 inches).

{{main|UN-OHRLLS}}

The [[United Nations]] has an Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). It mainly holds the view that high transport costs due to distance and terrain result in the erosion of competitive edge for exports from landlocked countries.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"&gt;UN-OHRLLS. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it recognizes the constraints on landlocked countries to be mainly physical, including lack of direct access to the sea, isolation from world markets and high transit costs due to physical distance.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/&gt; It also attributes geographic remoteness as one of the most significant reasons why developing landlocked nations cannot alleviate{{clarify|date=March 2017}} themselves, while European landlocked cases are mostly developed because of short distances to the sea through well-developed countries.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/&gt; One other commonly cited factor is the administrative burdens associated with border crossings as there is a heavy load of bureaucratic procedures, paperwork, custom charges, and most importantly, traffic delay due to border wait times, which affect delivery contracts.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Delays and inefficiency compound geographically, where a 2 to 3 week wait due to border customs between [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] makes it impossible to book ships ahead of time in [[Mombasa]], furthering delivery contract delays.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these explanations, it is also important to consider the transit countries that neighbour LLDCs, from whose ports the goods of LLDCs are exported.

==Dependency problems==
Although [[Adam Smith]] and traditional thought hold that geography and transportation are the culprits for keeping LLDCs from realizing development gains, Faye, Sachs and Snow hold the argument that no matter the advancement of infrastructure or lack of geographic distance to a port, landlocked nations are still dependent on their neighbouring transit nations.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Outlying this specific relationship of dependency, Faye et al. insist that though LLDCs vary across the board in terms of HDI index scores, LLDCs almost uniformly straddle at the bottom of HDI rankings in terms of region, suggesting a correlated dependency relationship of development for landlocked countries with their respective regions.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, HDI levels decrease as one moves inland along the major transit route that runs from the coast of Kenya, across the country before going through Uganda, [[Rwanda]] and then finally [[Burundi]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39"/&gt; Just recently, it has been economically modeled that if the economic size of a transit country is increased by just 1%, a subsequent increase of at least 2% is experienced by the landlocked country, which shows that there is hope for LLDCs if the conditions of their transit neighbours are addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Paudel. 2012, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some LLDCs are seeing the brighter side of such a relationship, with the Central Asian nations geographic location between three [[BRIC]] nations (China, [[Russia]] and [[India]]) hungry for the region's oil and mineral wealth serving to boost economic development.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"&gt;Fara. 2012, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The three major factors that LLDCs are dependent on their transit neighbours are dependence on transit infrastructure, dependence on political relations with neighbours, and dependence on internal peace and stability within transit neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burundi===
[[File:Map displaying landlocked Burundi's strife with finding a suitable export route.png|thumb|400px| Burundi is shown in blue. Its possible export routes were:

* dependent on infrastructure of transit neighbour Tanzania (yellow), or

&lt;br&gt;* dependent on political relations with transit neighbour Kenya (orange), or 
* dependent on internal stability of transit neighbour Mozambique (red).
When all three routes were unavailable, Burundi had to rely on the port of Durban in South Africa (brown).]]
Burundi has relatively good internal road networks, but it cannot export its goods using the most direct route to the sea since the inland infrastructure of [[Tanzania]] is poorly connected to the port of [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Burundi relies on Kenya's port of Mombasa for export; but this route was severed briefly in the 1990s when political relations with Kenya deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt; Further, Burundi's exports could not pass through [[Mozambique]] around the same time due to violent civil conflict.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47"/&gt; Thus, Burundi had to export its goods using a 4500&amp;nbsp;km route, crossing several borders and changing transport modes, to reach the port of [[Durban]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt;

===Other African countries===

* [[Mali]] had problems exporting goods in the 1990s as nearly all its transit neighbours ([[Algeria]], [[Togo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Guinea]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]]) were engaged in civil war around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The exception being Ghana which was under a military rule but did not have an active civil war
* The [[Central African Republic]]'s export routes are seasonal: in the rainy season Cameroon's roads are too poor to use; and during the dry season the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]'s [[Oubangui River]] water levels are too low for river travel.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt;

===Central Asia===

The mineral resource-rich countries of [[Central Asia]] and [[Mongolia]] offer a unique set of landlocked cases to explore in more depth, as these are nations where economic growth has grown exceptionally in recent years.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/&gt; In Central Asia, oil and coal deposits have influenced development: [[Kazakhstan]]’s GDI per capita in purchasing power parity was five times greater than [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s in 2009.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/&gt; Despite substantial development growth, these nations are not on a stable and destined path to being well developed, as the exploitation of their natural resources translates into an overall low average income and disparity of income, and because their limited deposits of resources allow growth only in the short term, and most importantly because dependence on unprocessed materials increases the risk of shocks due to variations in market prices.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"&gt;Fara. 2012, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; And though it is widely conceived that free trade can permit faster economic growth,&lt;ref&gt;Paudel. 2012, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Mongolia is now subjected to a new geopolitical game about the traffic on its railway lines between China and Russia.&lt;ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100"&gt;Bulag. 2009, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Railways]] now effectively owns 50% of Mongolia's rail infrastructure, which could mean more efficient modernization and the laying of new rail lines, but in reality also translates into powerful leverage to pressure the government of Mongolia to concede unfair terms for license grants of coal, copper, and gold mines.&lt;ref&gt;Bulag. 2009, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it can be argued that these nations with extraordinary mineral wealth should pursue economic diversification.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/&gt; All of these nations possess education qualifications, as they are inheritors of the [[Soviet Union]]'s social education system. This implies that it is due to poor economic policies that more than 40% of the labour force is bogged down in the agricultural sector instead of being diverted into secondary or tertiary economic activity.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/&gt; Yet, it cannot be ignored that Mongolia benefits exceptionally from its proximity to two giant BRIC nations, resulting in a rapid development of railway ports along its borders, especially along the Chinese border, as the Chinese seek to direct coking coal from Mongolia to China's northwestern industrial core as well as for transportation to [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], resulting in revenue generation through the port of [[Tianjin]].&lt;ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100"/&gt;

===Nepal===
[[Nepal]] is another landlocked country with extreme dependency on its transit neighbour India. India does not have poor relations with Nepal, nor does it lack relevant transport infrastructure or internal stability. In the 1970s, Nepal suffered from large commodity concentration and a high geographic centralization in its export trade: over 98% of its exports were to India, and 90% of its imports came from India.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1114.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of all this, Nepal had a poor trade bargaining position.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; In the 1950s, Nepal was forced to comply with India's external tariffs as well as the prices of India's exports.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; This was problematic since the two countries have different levels of development, resulting in greater gains for India which was larger, more advanced and with more resources.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; It was feared that a parasitic relationship might emerge, since India had a head start in industrialization, and dominated Nepal in manufacturing, which could reduce Nepal to being just a supplier of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1116-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these problems, and Nepal's inability to develop its own infant industries (as it could not compete with Indian manufactures)&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1117.&lt;/ref&gt; treaties were drafted in 1960 and 1971, with amendments to the equal tariffs conditions, and terms of trade have since progressed.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Almaty Ministerial Conference==
In August, 2003, the International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries on Transit Transport Cooperation (Almaty Ministerial Conference) was held in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, setting the necessities of LLDCs in a universal document whereas there were no coordinated efforts on the global scale to serve the unique needs of LLDCs in the past.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; Other than acknowledging the main forms of dependency that must be addressed, it also acknowledged the additional dependency issue where neighbouring transit countries are often observed to export the same products as their landlocked neighbours.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; One result of the conference was a direct call for donor countries to step in to direct aid into setting up suitable infrastructure of transit countries to alleviate the burden of supporting LLDCs in regions of poor development in general.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; The general objectives of the Almaty Program of Action is as follows:
*Reduce customs processes and fees to minimize costs and transport delays
*Improve infrastructure with respect to existing preferences of local transport modes, where road should be focused in Africa and rail in South Asia
*Implement preferences for landlocked countries’ commodities to boost their competitiveness in the international market
*To establish relationships between donor countries with landlocked and transit countries for technical, financial and policy improvements&lt;ref&gt;UN-OHRLLS. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anonymous The Noord-Nieuwland in Table Bay, 1762.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An 18th-century painting of a [[Dutch East Indies Company|VOC]] ship with [[Table Mountain]] in the background, used by navigators as the landmark to sail around [[Cape of Good Hope|southern tip of Africa]].]]

A '''landmark''' is a recognizable natural or artificial feature used for [[navigation]], a feature that stands out from its near environment and is often visible from long distances.

In modern use, the term can also be applied to smaller structures or features, that have become local or [[national symbol]]s.

==Etymology==
[[File:Welcome to the land of freedom.png|thumb|right|The [[Statue of Liberty]], a famous landmark of [[New York City]] and [[United States]], greets the newly arrived immigrants, located near [[Ellis Island]] where millions of immigrants first touched U.S. soil.]]
In old English the word ''landmearc'' (from ''land'' + ''mearc'' (mark)) was used to describe an "object set up to mark the boundaries of a kingdom, estate, etc.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=landmark |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from approx. 1560, this understanding of landmark was replaced by a more general one. A landmark became a "conspicuous object in a landscape".
A ''landmark'' literally meant a [[geographic feature]] used by [[exploration|explorers]] and others to find their way back or through an area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} For example, the [[Table Mountain]] near [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] is used as the landmark to help sailors to navigate around southern tip of [[Africa]] during the [[Age of Exploration]]. Artificial structures are also sometimes built to assist sailors in naval navigation. The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] and [[Colossus of Rhodes]] are ancient structures built to lead ships to the port.

In modern usage, a landmark includes anything that is easily recognizable, such as a [[monument]], [[building]], or other [[structure]]. In [[American English]] it is the main term used to designate places that might be of interest to [[tourist]]s due to notable physical features or historical significance. Landmarks in the [[British English]] sense are often used for casual [[navigation]], such as giving directions. This is done in American English as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In [[urban studies]] as well as in [[geography]], a landmark is furthermore defined as an external point of reference that helps orienting in a familiar or unfamiliar environment.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Kevin. "The image of the city". [[MIT Press]], 1960, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Landmarks are often used in verbal route instructions and as such an object of study by [[linguist]]s as well as in other fields of study.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Types==
[[File:Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Eiffel Tower]] - tallest in the world from 1889 to 1930 and a famous [[Paris]] landmark]]
Landmarks are usually classified as either natural landmarks or man-made landmarks, both are originally used to support navigation on finding directions. A variant is a ''[[seamark]]'' or ''[[daymark]]'', a structure usually built intentionally to aid sailors navigating featureless coasts.

===Natural===
Natural landmarks can be characteristic features, such as [[mountain]]s or [[plateau]]s. Examples of natural landmarks are Table Mountain in South Africa, [[Mount Ararat]] in Turkey, [[Uluru]] in Australia, [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan and [[Grand Canyon]] in the United States. Trees might also serve as local landmarks, such as jubilee oaks or [[conifer]]s. Some landmark trees may be nicknamed, examples being ''Queen's Oak'', ''Hanging Oak'' or ''Centennial Tree''.

===Human made===
In modern sense, landmarks are usually referred to as [[monument]]s or prominent distinctive buildings, used as the symbol of a certain area, city, or [[National symbol|nation]], such as the [[Statue of Unity]] in [[Narmada District | Narmada]] ,[[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington (D.C.)]], [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York City]], [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]] , [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]], [[Big Ben]] in [[London]], [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Bratislava Castle]] in [[Bratislava]], [[Space Needle]] in [[Seattle]],   [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] or the [[Sydney Opera House]] both in [[Sydney]], [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Berlin]], the [[CN Tower]] In [[Toronto]], or [[Palace of Culture and Science]] in [[Warsaw]]. [[Church (building)|Church]] [[spire]]s and [[mosque]]'s [[minaret]]s are often very tall and visible from many miles around, thus often serve as built landmarks. Also [[town hall]] towers and [[Belfry (architecture)|belfries]] often have a landmark character.

Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian-Gaza border. and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. &lt;br&gt;Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings. Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter pans of the territory and/or deploy missile attacks, drones and sonic bombs into Gaza. Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight. Gaza is also dependent on Israel for water, electricity, telecommunications and other utilities, currency, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory. Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker. Since 2000 aside from a limited number of exceptions Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry.&lt;br&gt;It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations, the UN General Assembly, the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza, International human rights organisations, US Government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators, to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied.|doi=10.1007/978-90-6704-811-8_14}}&lt;br&gt;* {{cite book|title=International Law and the Classification of Conflicts|editor=Elizabeth Wilmshurst|first=Iain|last=Scobbie|authorlink=Iain Scobbie|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2012|isbn=978-0-19-965775-9|page=295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM90Xp03uuEC&amp;pg=PA295|quote=Even after the accession to power of Hamas, Israel's claim that it no longer occupies Gaza has not been accepted by UN bodies, most States, nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with Gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the Rafah crossing until at least May 2011, its control of Gaza's maritime zones and airspace which constitute what Aronson terms the 'security envelope' around Gaza, as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in Gaza.}}&lt;br&gt;* {{cite book|title=Prefiguring Peace: Israeli-Palestinian Peacebuilding Partnerships|first=Michelle|last= Gawerc|publisher=Lexington Books|date=2012|isbn=9780739166109|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hka8FZ4UdWUC&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=While Israel withdrew from the immediate territory, it remained in control of all access to and from Gaza through the border crossings, as well as through the coastline and the airspace.

Dowty 2008). ln other words, while Israel maintained that its occupation of Gaza ended with its unilateral disengagement Palestinians – as well as many human right organizations and international bodies – argued that Gaza was by all intents and purposes still occupied.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations, international human rights organisations, and the majority of governments and legal commentators consider the territory to be still occupied by Israel, supported by additional restrictions placed on Gaza by Egypt. Israel maintains direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza: it controls Gaza's air and maritime space, and six of Gaza's seven land crossings. It reserves the right to enter Gaza at will with its military and maintains a no-go buffer zone within the Gaza territory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9465">This is a '''list of warehouse districts''' that are notable.

A '''warehouse district''' or '''warehouse row''' is an area found in many urban setting known for being the current or former location of numerous [[warehouses]]. Logistically, warehouses are often located in [[industrial park]]s, with access to bulk transportation outlets such as highways, railroads, and airports.&lt;ref&gt;G. Jason Goddard, Bill Marcum, ''Real Estate Investment: A Value Based Approach'' (2012), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The areas where warehouses are typically built are often designated as [[Zoning|special zones]] for [[urban planning]] purposes, and "can have their own substantial [[infrastructure]]s, comprising [[road]]s, [[Public utility|utilities]], and [[Energy industry|energy systems]]".&lt;ref&gt;Neil S. Grigg, ''Economics and Finance for Engineers and Planners'' (2009), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, where changing social and economic conditions have made it unfeasable to maintain an existing warehouse district, cities or communities will invest in converting the district to other purposes for which this infrastructure can still be used, such an art district.&lt;ref&gt;American Planning Association, ''Planning and Urban Design Standards'' (2006), p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a converted area may continue to be known as a warehouse district.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4794">'''Navigational instruments''' refers to the instruments used by nautical navigators and pilots as tools of their trade. The purpose of navigation is to ascertain the present position and to determine the speed, direction etc. to arrive at the port or point of destination.

==Charts and drafting instruments==
*'''[[Nautical chart|Charts]]''' are maps of the areas to be navigated with details specific to the marine environment.
*'''Computing aids''': used in the necessary mathematical calculations. Today electronic [[computers]] or [[calculators]] are used.  Other traditional aids used included tables (trigonometric, logarithms, etc.) and [[slide rules]].
*'''[[Caliper#Divider caliper|Dividers]]''' used for measuring lengths of lines and approximate lengths of non-linear paths on a chart.
*'''[[Nautical almanac]]''' used to determine the position in the sky of a celestial body after a sight has been taken.
*'''[[Parallel rulers|Parallel rules]]''' used for transferring a line to a parallel position.  Also used to compare the orientation of a line to a magnetic or geographic orientation on a [[compass rose]].

==Direct measuring==
*'''[[Chip log]] and [[hourglass|sand glass]]''' serve to measure the ship's speed through the water.
*'''[[Sounding line]]''' used to measure the depth of the water and to pick up samples from the bottom.

==Position finding instruments==

===Celestial navigation instruments===

These instruments are used primarily to measure the elevation or altitude of a [[celestial object]]:

*'''[[Back staff]]''', the best known of which is the Davis' quadrant.  It could measure the altitude of the sun without having the navigator directly observe the sun.
*'''[[Cross staff]]''', an older instrument long out of use.
*'''[[Kamal (navigation)|Kamal]]''' Very simple instrument used primarily by Arabian navigators. It consists of a small board with a knotted piece of twine through the center. The observer holds one of the knots in his mouth and extends the board away so that the edges make a constant angle with his eyes.
*'''[[Mariner's astrolabe]]''' Derived from the [[astrolabe]], it was developed in late 15th century and found use in the 16th to 17th centuries.  It was replaced by the [[back staff]] and later by the [[octant (instrument)|octant]] and [[sextant]].
*'''[[Quadrant (instrument)|Quadrant]]''' A very simple instrument which used a plumb bob.

These instruments are also used to measure the angular distance between objects:

*'''[[Octant (instrument)|Octant]]''', invented in 1731.  The first widely accepted instrument that could measure an angle without being strongly affected by movement.
*'''[[Sextant]]''', derived from the octant in 1757, eventually made all previous instruments used for the same purpose obsolete.

===Bearing instruments===
*'''[[Pelorus (instrument)|Pelorus]]''' used to determine bearings relative to the ship's heading of landmarks, other ships, etc.

===Compasses===
*'''[[Bearing compass]]''' used to determine magnetic bearings of landmarks, other ships or celestial bodies.
*'''[[Magnetic compass]]''' used to determine the magnetic heading of the ship.

===Timekeeping===
*'''[[Marine chronometer]]''' used to determine time at the [[prime meridian]] with great precision which is necessary when reducing sights in celestial navigation.
*'''[[Nocturnal (instrument)|Nocturnal]]''' used to determine apparent local time by viewing the [[Polaris]] and its surrounding stars.
*'''[[Sundial#Ring dials|Ring dial]]''' or '''astronomical ring''' used to measure the height of a celestial body above the horizon. It could be used to find the altitude of the sun or determine local time.  It let sunlight shine through a small orifice on the rim of the instrument.  The point of light striking the far side of the instrument gave the altitude or tell time.

All those mentioned were the traditional instruments used until well into the second half of the 20th century.  After World War II electronic aids to navigation developed very rapidly and, to a great extent, replaced more traditional tools. Electronic speed and depth finders have totally replaced their older counterparts.  [[Radar]] has become widespread even in small boats.  Some Electronic aids to navigation like [[LORAN]] have already become obsolete themselves and have been replaced by [[GPS]].

[[File:Map of America by Sebastian Munster.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Sebastian Münster]]'s map of the New World, first published in 1540]]
[[File:Graverat titelblad - Skoklosters slott - 93404.tif|thumb|History of the New World "Historia antipodum oder newe Welt". Matthäus Merian, 1631.]]

The '''New World''' is one of the names used for the majority of [[Earth]]'s [[Western Hemisphere]], specifically the [[Americas]] (including nearby islands such as those of the [[List of Caribbean islands|Caribbean]] and [[Bermuda]]).

The term originated in the early 16th century after [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Europeans made landfall]] in what would later be called the Americas in the [[age of discovery]], expanding the geographical horizon of [[Greco-Roman geography|classical geographers]], who had thought of the [[world]] as consisting of [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]], collectively now referred to as the [[Old World]] (a.k.a. [[Afro-Eurasia]]).

The phrase gained prominence after the publication of a pamphlet titled ''Mundus Novus'' attributed to [[Italians|Italian]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=upkyAQAAMAAJ Mundus Novus: Letter to Lorenzo Pietro Di Medici], by Amerigo Vespucci; translation by George Tyler Northrup, Princeton University Press; 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Americas were also referred to as the "fourth part of the world".&lt;ref name="M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417"&gt;M.H.Davidson (1997) ''Columbus Then and Now, a life re-examined. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press'', p. 417)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The terms "[[Old World]]" vs. "New World" are meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world's major [[ecozones]], and to classify plant and animal species that originated therein.

One can speak of the "New World" in a [[history|historical]] context, e.g., when discussing the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]], the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] and other events of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial]] period. For lack of alternatives, the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the Americas and the nearby [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]], such as [[Bermuda]] and [[Clipperton Island]], collectively.

The term "New World" is used in a [[biology|biological]] context, when one speaks of Old World ([[Palearctic ecozone|Palearctic]], [[Afrotropic ecozone|Afrotropic]]) and New World species ([[Nearctic ecozone|Nearctic]], [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropic]]). Biological [[Biological classification|taxonomists]] often attach the "New World" label to groups of species that are found exclusively in the Americas, to distinguish them from their counterparts in the "Old World" (Europe, Africa and Asia), e.g. [[New World monkey]]s, [[New World vulture]]s, [[New World warbler]]s.

The label is also often used in agriculture. Asia, Africa, and Europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago, making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as "Old World". Common Old World crops (e.g., [[barley]], [[lentil]]s, [[oats]], [[pea]]s, [[rye]], [[wheat]]), and domesticated animals (e.g., [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[goat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[pig]]s, [[sheep]]) did not exist in the Americas until they were introduced by post-[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbian contact]] in the 1490s (see "[[Columbian Exchange]]"). Conversely, many common [[crops]] were originally domesticated in the Americas before they spread worldwide after Columbian contact, and are still often referred to as "[[New World crops]]"; [[common bean]]s (''phaseolus''), [[maiz]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]] – the "[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]" – as well as the [[avocado]], [[tomato]], and wide varieties of [[capsicum]] ([[bell pepper]], [[chili pepper]], etc.), and the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] were originally domesticated by [[pre-Columbian]] peoples in [[Mesoamerica]], while agriculturalists in the [[Andean]] region of South America brought forth the [[cassava]], [[peanut]], [[potato]], [[quinoa]] and domesticated animals like the [[alpaca]], [[guinea pig]] and [[llama]]. Other famous New World crops include the [[cashew]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[rubber]], [[sunflower]], [[tobacco]], and [[vanilla]], and fruits like the [[guava]], [[papaya]] and [[pineapple]]. There are rare instances of overlap, e.g., the [[calabash]] (bottle-gourd), [[cotton]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], and the dog, are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the [[Old World|Old]] and New World, their early forms possibly brought along by [[Paleo-Indians]] from Asia during the [[last glacial period]].

In [[wine terminology]], "New World" has a different definition. "[[New World wines]]" include not only North American and South American wines, but also those from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and all other locations outside the traditional wine-growing regions of Europe, North Africa and the Near East.&lt;ref name="Wine Folly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://winefolly.com/review/new-world-vs-old-world-wine/|title=Real Differences: New World vs Old World Wine |publisher= Wine Folly|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==

[[File:Stradanus America.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the New World: [[Amerigo Vespucci]] awakens the sleeping America]] 
The term "New World" ("Mundus Novus") was first coined by the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], in a letter written to his friend and former patron [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463–1503)|Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici]] in the Spring of 1503, and published (in [[Latin]]) in 1503–04 under the title ''Mundus Novus''. Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted by [[Christopher Columbus]], but rather an entirely different continent, a "New World".&lt;ref name="M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417"/&gt;

Vespucci first approached this realization in June 1502, during a famous chance meeting between two different expeditions at the watering stop of "Bezeguiche" (the Bay of [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]) – his own outgoing expedition, on its way to chart the coast of newly discovered [[Brazil]], and the vanguard ships of the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second Portuguese India armada]] of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], returning home from India. Having already visited the Americas in prior years, Vespucci probably found it difficult to reconcile what he had already seen in the [[West Indies]], with what the returning sailors told him of the [[East Indies]]. Vespucci wrote a preliminary letter to Lorenzo, while anchored at Bezeguiche, which he sent back with the Portuguese fleet – at this point only expressing a certain puzzlement about his conversations.&lt;ref&gt;This preliminary letter from Bezeguiche was not published, but remained in manuscript form. It is reproduced in F.A. de Varnhagen (1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 78–82]).&lt;/ref&gt; Vespucci was finally convinced when he proceeded on his mapping expedition through 1501–02, covering the huge stretch of coast of eastern Brazil. After returning from Brazil, in the Spring of 1503, Amerigo Vespucci composed the ''Mundus Novus'' letter in Lisbon to Lorenzo in Florence, with its famous opening paragraph:&lt;ref&gt;English translation of ''Mundus Novus'' as found in Markham (1894: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8wAuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 42–52])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In passed days I wrote very fully to you of my return from new countries, which have been found and explored with the ships, at the  cost and by the command of this Most Serene King of Portugal; and it is lawful to call it a new world, because none of these countries were known to our ancestors and all who hear about them they will be entirely new.  For the opinion of the ancients was, that the greater part of the world beyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land, but only sea, which they have called the Atlantic; and even if they have affirmed that any continent is there, they have given many reasons for denying it is inhabited. But this opinion is false, and entirely opposed to the  truth. My last voyage has proved it, for I have found a continent in that southern part; full of animals and more populous than our Europe, or Asia, or Africa, and even more temperate and pleasant than any other region known to us.|}}

Vespucci's letter was a publishing sensation in Europe, immediately (and repeatedly) reprinted in several other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Varnhagen, ''Amerígo Vespucci'' (1865:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 13–26]) provides side-by-side reproductions of both the 1503 Latin version ''Mundus Novus'', and the 1507 Italian re-translation "El Nuovo Mondo de Lengue Spagnole interpretato in Idioma Ro. Libro Quinto" (from ''Paesi Nuovamente retrovati''). The Latin version of ''Mundus Novus'' was reprinted many times (see Varnhagen, 1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 9] for a list of early reprints).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prior usage ===

While Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term "New World" (''Mundus Novus'') for the Americas in his 1503 letter, certainly giving it its popular cachet, similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.

The [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] had used the term "un altro mundo" ("another world") to refer to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;Cadamosto ''Navigationi'', c. 1470, as reprinted in Giovanni Ramusio (1554: [https://books.google.com/books?id=iZ5TZHXOnYcC&amp;pg=RA2-PA106-IA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 106]). See also M. Zamora ''Reading Columbus'', (1993: p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new "fourth" part of the world. Cadamosto was quite aware sub-Saharan Africa was firmly part of the African continent.

The [[Italy|Italian]]-born Spanish chronicler [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] often shares credit with Vespucci for designating the Americas as a new world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= de Madariaga | first= Salvador | authorlink= Salvador de Madariaga | year=1952 | publisher= Editorial Hermes | location= Mexico | edition= 5th | title= Vida del muy magnífico señor Don Cristóbal Colón | page= 363 | quote= "nuevo mundo", [...] designación que Pedro Mártyr será el primero en usar | language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Martyr used the term ''Orbe Novo'' (literally, "New Globe", but often translated as "New World") in the title of his history of the discovery of the Americas as a whole, which began to appear in 1511 (cosmologically, "orbis" as used here refers to the whole hemisphere, while "mundus" refers to the land within it).&lt;ref&gt;J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: p. 268)&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Martyr had been writing and circulating private letters commenting on Columbus's discoveries since 1493 and, from the start, doubted Columbus's claims to have reached East Asia ("the Indies"), and consequently came up with alternative names to refer to them.&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Bourne ''Spain in America, 1450–580'' New York: Harper (1904: p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few weeks after Columbus's return from his first voyage, Peter Martyr wrote letters referring to Columbus's discovered lands as the "western antipodes" ("antipodibus occiduis", letter of May 14, 1493),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 72])&lt;/ref&gt; the "new hemisphere of the earth" ("novo terrarum hemisphaerio", September 13, 1493),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 133, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt; and in a letter dated November 1, 1493, refers to Columbus as the "discoverer of the new globe" ("Colonus ille novi orbis repertor").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 138, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 76])&lt;/ref&gt; A year later (October 20, 1494), Peter Martyr again refers to the marvels of the New Globe ("Novo Orbe") and the "Western hemisphere."("ab occidente hemisphero").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 156 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Columbus]] touched the continent of South America in his 1498 [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third voyage]]. In his own 1499 letter to the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain, reporting the results of his third voyage, Columbus relates how the massive waters of the [[Orinoco]] delta rushing into the [[Gulf of Paria]] implied that a previously unknown continent must lie behind it.&lt;ref&gt;"if the river mentioned does not proceed from the terrestrial paradise, it comes from an immense tract of land situated in the south, of which no knowledge has been hitherto obtained" (Columbus 1499 letter on the third voyage, as reproduced in R.H. Major, ''Select Letters of Christopher Columbus'', 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 147])&lt;/ref&gt; However, bowing to the classical tripartite division of the world, Columbus discards that hypothesis and proposes instead that the South American landmass is not a "fourth" continent, but rather the [[terrestrial paradise]] of Biblical tradition, not a previously unknown "new" part of the world, but a land already "known" (but location undiscovered) by [[Christendom]].&lt;ref&gt;J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: pp. 266–67)&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter (to the nurse of Prince John, written 1500), Columbus refers to having reached a "new heavens and world" ("nuevo cielo e mundo")&lt;ref&gt;Columbus 1500 letter to the nurse (in Major, 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 154])&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had placed "another world" ("otro mundo") under the dominion of the Kings of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus's 1500 letter to the nurse(Major, 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 170])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acceptance ===
The Vespucci passage above applied the "New World" label to merely the continental landmass of [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Ober ''Amerigo Vespucci'' New York: Harper (1907: pp. 239, 244)&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, most of the continent of [[North America]] was not yet discovered, and Vespucci's comments did not eliminate the possibility that the islands of the [[Antilles]] discovered earlier by [[Christopher Columbus]] might still be the eastern edges of Asia, as Columbus continued to insist down to his dying day.&lt;ref&gt;S.E. Morison ''The European Discovery of America, v.2: The southern voyages, 1492–1616''.(1974: pp. 265–66).&lt;/ref&gt; A critical step in the transition was the conference of navigators (''Junta de Navegantes'') assembled by the Spanish monarchs at [[Toro, Zamora|Toro]] in 1505, and continued at [[Burgos]] in 1508, to digest all existing information about the Indies, come to an agreement on what had really been discovered, and set out the future goals of Spanish exploration. Amerigo Vespucci attended both conferences, and seems to have had an outsized influence on them – Vespucci ended up being appointed the first ''piloto mayor'', the chief of navigation of Spain, at Burgos.&lt;ref&gt;For an account of Vespucci at Toro and Burgos,  see Navarette ''Colección de los viages y descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los españoles desde fines del siglo XV''(1829: v.iii, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESYW_1DUELoC&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 320–23])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the proceedings of the Toro-Burgos conferences are missing, it is almost certain that Vespucci articulated his recent "New World" thesis to his fellow navigators there. It was during these conferences when Spanish officials seem to have finally accepted that the Antilles and the known stretch of Central America were definitely ''not'' the Indies they had originally sought, and Columbus had insisted they were, and set out the new goal for Spanish explorers: to find a sea passage or [[strait]] through the Americas which would permit them to sail to Asia proper.&lt;ref&gt;C.O. Sauer ''The Early Spanish Main''. Cambridge (1966: pp. 166–67)&lt;/ref&gt; In English usage the term "New World" was problematic and only accepted relatively late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=New World Discovery|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|date=2015|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935338.001.0001|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935338.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935338-e-141|accessdate=2 June 2016|doi-broken-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cartographic representation ===

[[File:Map Diego Ribero 1529.jpg|thumb|The World Map by [[Diogo Ribeiro]] (1529) labels the [[Americas]] as ''MUNDUS NOVUS''. It traces most of South America and the east coast of North America.]]
While it became generally accepted after Vespucci that Columbus's discoveries were not Asia but a "New World", the geographic relationship between the two continents was still unclear.&lt;ref name = parry&gt;J.H. Parry, ''The Discovery of the Sea'' (1974: p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt; That there must be a large ocean between Asia and the Americas was implied by the known existence of vast continuous sea along the coasts of [[East Asia]]. Given the size of the Earth as calculated by [[Eratosthenes]] this left a large space between Asia and the newly discovered lands.  

Even prior to Vespucci, several maps, e.g. the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 and the [[Canerio map]] of 1504, placed a large open ocean between China on the east side of the map, and the inchoate largely water-surrounded North American and South American discoveries on the western side of map. However, out of uncertainty, they depicted a finger of the Asian land mass stretching across the top to the eastern edge of the map, suggesting it carried over into the western hemisphere (e.g. the Cantino Planisphere denotes [[Greenland]] as "Punta d'Asia" – "edge of Asia"). Some maps, e.g. the 1506 [[Contarini–Rosselli map]] and the 1508 [[Johannes Ruysch]] map, bowing to Ptolemaic authority and Columbus's assertions, have the northern Asian landmass stretching well into the western hemisphere and merging with known North America (Labrador, Newfoundland, etc.). These maps place the island of Japan near Cuba and leave the South American continent – Vespucci's "New World" proper – detached and floating below by itself.&lt;ref name = parry/&gt; The [[Waldseemüller map]] of 1507, which accompanied the famous ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'' volume (which includes reprints of Vespucci's letters) comes closest to modernity by placing a completely open sea (with no stretching land fingers) between Asia on the eastern side and the New World (being represented two times in the same map in a different way: with and without a sea passage in the middle of what is now named Central America) on the western side – which (on what is now named South America) that same map famously labels simply "''[[Naming of America|America]]''". However, [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s map of 1516 retreats considerably from his earlier map and back to classical authority, with the Asian land mass merging into North America (which he now calls ''Terra de Cuba Asie partis''), and quietly drops the "America" label from South America, calling it merely ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]''.&lt;ref name = parry/&gt;

The western coast of the New World – the [[Pacific Ocean]] – was only discovered in 1513 by [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]. But it would take a few more years – [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage of 1519–22 – to determine that the Pacific definitely formed a single large body of water separating Asia from the Americas. It would be several more years before the Pacific Coast of North America was mapped, dispelling lingering doubts. Until the discovery of the [[Bering Strait]]s in the 17th century, there was no absolute confirmation that Asia and North America were not connected, and some European maps of the 16th century still continued to hopefully depict North America connected by a land bridge to Asia (e.g. the 1533 [[Johannes Schöner globe]]).&lt;ref name = parry/&gt;

In 1524, the term was used by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in a record of his voyage that year along the Atlantic coast of [[North America]], land that is now part of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Verrazzano, Giovanni da (1524).[http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm "The Written Record of the Voyage of 1524 of Giovanni da Verrazzano as recorded in a letter to Francis I, King of France, July 8th, 1524"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908085440/http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm |date=2006-09-08 }}. Citing: Wroth, Lawrence C., ed. (1970). ''The Voyages of Giovanni da Verrazzano, 1524–1528''. Yale, pp. 133–43. Citing: a translation by Susan Tarrow of the ''[[Cèllere Codex]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''observation deck''', '''observation platform''' or '''viewing platform''' is an elevated [[Tourism|sightseeing]] platform usually situated upon a tall architectural structure such as a [[skyscraper]] or [[observation tower]]. Observation decks are sometimes enclosed from weather, and a few may include coin-operated telescopes for viewing distant features.

Among the pantheon of winners of this award are [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[philanthropist]] and [[mountaineer]] Sir [[Edmund Hillary]], [[ethnographer]] and [[adventurer]] [[Thor Heyerdahl]], Dr. [[William B. Walsh|William Walsh]], who started Project Hope, [[oceanographer]] and underwater archaeologist Dr. [[Robert Ballard]], oceanographer [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]], and astronaut and United States Senator [[John Glenn]].  The Magellan Award is the highest award bestowed by the Circumnavigators Club,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circumnavigators.org/magellan/past.php The Circumnavigators Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830193139/http://www.circumnavigators.org/magellan/past.php |date=2009-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1902.  
The honor is named after the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] born explorer, [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who is widely known as the first captain to sail around the world—though he didn't complete the circumnavigation as he died during the voyage in the Philippines, that being the Spanish navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], who took over command of the expedition after Magellan's death, and completed the trip.

The '''Permanent European Conference for the Study of the Rural Landscape (PECSRL)''' is an international network of [[landscape]] researchers whose interest focus on the past, present and future of European landscapes, and serves as an international platform for new initiatives, meetings and publications about European rural landscapes. It meets every two years in a different European country for lectures, discussions, working groups and landscape excursions. It has several working groups that focus on actual problems in European landscape management and landscape research. The unifying concept of PECSRL is the past, present and future of European landscapes, relating to landscape research as well as landscape policy and landscape management.

==Objectives==
The objectives of PECSRL are:
* to facilitate personal contacts and information exchange between European landscape researchers;
* to improve interdisciplinary cooperation between landscape researchers from various scientific and human landscape disciplines;
* to improve cooperation between landscape researchers and landscape managers;
* to function as a platform for new initiatives in European landscape research and landscape management.

==History and scope==
The Permanent European Conference for the Study of the Rural Landscape is one of the most stable European networks of landscape researchers. It was established in 1957 at an inaugural conference held in Nancy, France. Initially, it consisted mainly of [[Historical geography|(historical)]] [[geography|geographers]], but during the last few decades its membership has diversified to include ecologists, social scientists, rural planners, landscape architects, historians, archaeologists, landscape managers, as well as other scholars and practitioners interested in European landscapes. Members undertake both fundamental and applied research on all aspects of the rural landscape or have a position in landscape management or heritage management. PECSRL covers Pan-Europe which means that it connects researchers from Northern, Eastern, Southern, Central and Western Europe. All together more than thirty European countries take part in PECSRL.

A '''principal meridian''' is a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] used for survey control in a large region.

==Canada==
The [[Dominion Land Survey]] of [[Western Canada]] took its origin at the First (or Principal) Meridian, located at 97°27′28.41″ west of [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich]], just west of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. This line is exactly ten miles west of the Red River at the Canada-United States border.

Six other meridians were designated at four-degree intervals westward, with the seventh located in British Columbia; the second and fourth meridians form the general eastern border and the western border of [[Saskatchewan]].

==United States==
[[File:Meridians-baselines.png|thumb|300px|right|This [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] map depicts the principal meridians and [[baseline (surveying)|baselines]] used for surveying states (colored) in the PLSS.]]
In the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]], a principal meridian is the principal north-south line used for survey control in a large region, and which  divides townships between east and west. The meridian meets its corresponding [[baseline (surveying)|baseline]] at the point of origin, or [[initial point]], for the land survey. For example, the [[Mount Diablo Meridian]], used for surveys in California and Nevada, runs north-south through the summit of [[Mount Diablo State Park|Mount Diablo]].

Often, meridians are marked with roads, such as the Meridian Avenue in [[San Jose, California]], Meridian Road in [[Vacaville, California]], both on the [[Mount Diablo Meridian]], Meridian Road in [[Wichita, Kansas]] on the Sixth Principal Meridian, and Meridian Avenue in several western Washington counties generally following the Willamette Meridian.  Baseline Road or Base Line Street extends for about 40 miles from [[Highland, California]] east of San Bernardino to [[La Verne, California]] where it meets Foothill Boulevard.

In Canada, the statistical designation '''remote and isolated community''' refers to a settlement that is either a long distance from larger settlements or lacks transportation links that are typical in more populated areas. 

In responding to the [[avian flu outbreak of 2009]], a Canadian government body (the Remote and Isolated Task Group [RITG] of the Public Health Network H1N1 Task Force) published the following [[working definitions]]:
{{quote|Remote: describes a geographical area where a community is located over 350 km from the nearest service centre having year-round road access.

''Isolated'', by the Canadian government definition, means a geographical area that has scheduled flights and good telephone services, but is without year-round road access. Note that not all homes in a community have phones, and that flights may be cancelled or delayed due to weather.|RITG&lt;ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/alert-alerte/h1n1/guidance_lignesdirectrices/cdricp-cdeicp-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the above quote, the definition of isolated is borrowed from [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]] (INAC) and the definition of remote is borrowed from [[Health Canada]].&lt;ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/alert-alerte/h1n1/guidance_lignesdirectrices/cdricp-cdeicp-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada also has ''fly-in communities'' that lack road, rail, or water connections and rely entirely on [[bush aviation]]. Other remote communities lack road and rail but have water access, such as the [[Newfoundland outport]]s, and those that have road access part of the year on [[ice roads]], or can only be reached by [[gravel road]]. One academic measure of remoteness used in Canada is [[nordicity]], i.e. "northerliness".

== Healthcare in remote and isolated communities ==
{{see also|Rural health}}
In Canada, there were 76 [[nursing stations]] and over 195 [[health centres]] servicing remote communities in [[Northern Canada]] or on [[Indian reserves]] in the south. In about facilities, [[registered nurses]] are employed by [[Health Canada]], a ministry of the [[government of Canada]]. In the other communities, nurses are employed by the [[First Nations government|Band Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/services/nurs-infirm/index-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policing in remote and isolated communities ==
Policing in remote areas presents many challenges, most obviously logistical, but also social and even psychological.

The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] had 268 "isolated posts" in 2009. Isolated posts are defined by the [[Treasury Board of Canada]] as communities that face "unique challenges" related to small populations, harsh climates, and/or limited access by commercial transportation or all-weather roads.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/gazette/vol71n1/vol71n5-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; All posts located in Canada's [[Northern Canada|three northern territories]] are considered isolated as well as many in the ten provinces. Many of these posts are "fly-in only"; the police force has its own RCMP Air Services, which does everything from ferry prisoners to court to bring in new computers to offices. In 2009, in the territory of [[Nunavut]] there were 25 detachments, all fly-in (no roads), and only one RCMP airplane.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"/&gt;

'''Right to light''' is a form of [[easement]] in [[English law]] that gives a long-standing owner of a building with windows a right to maintain the level of [[illumination (lighting)|illumination]]. It is based on the '''Ancient Lights''' law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Ancient+lights+%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=On ancient lights: and the evidence ... - Google Books |publisher=books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights are most usually acquired under the [[Prescription Act 1832]].

==Rights==
In effect, the owner of a building with windows that have received natural daylight for 20 years or more is entitled to forbid any construction or other obstruction that would deprive him or her of that illumination. Neighbours cannot build anything that would block the light without permission. The owner may build more or larger windows but cannot enlarge their new windows before the new period of 20 years has expired. It is also possible for a right to light to exist if granted expressly by [[deed]], or granted implicitly, for example under the rule in ''[[Wheeldon v Burrows|Wheeldon v. Burrows]]'' (1879).

Once a right to light exists, the owner of the right is entitled to "sufficient light according to the ordinary notions of mankind": ''[[Colls v. Home &amp; Colonial Stores Ltd]]'' (1904). Courts rely on [[expert witnesses]] to define this term. Since the 1920s, experts have used a method proposed by [[Percy Waldram]] to assist them with this. Waldram suggested that ordinary people require one [[foot-candle]] of [[illuminance]] (approximately ten [[lux]]) for reading and other work involving visual discrimination. This equates to a [[sky factor]] (similar to the [[daylight factor]]) of 0.2%. Today, Waldram's methods are increasingly subject to criticism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=D62CF262C987771E9EA2A8DB73A9A48F?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1603352 Was Waldram wrong?], P Defoe, ''[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]]'', 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pitts (2000), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf&amp;contentId=844738 The grumble point: is it still worth the candle?], ''[[Structural Survey]]'' '''18'''(5):255–8&lt;/ref&gt; and the future of expert evidence in rights to light cases is currently the subject of much debate within the surveying profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rics.org/Practiceareas/Property/Rightstolight/Rights%20to%20light%20the%20debate.html Rights to light surveying practice, the debate begins], Paul Chynoweth, ''[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]]'', 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], owners of buildings could gain new rights by registering properties that had been destroyed in [[bombing]]s and the period was temporarily increased to 27 years.

In the centre of [[London]] near [[Chinatown, London|Chinatown]] and [[Covent Garden]], particularly in back alleyways, signs saying "Ancient Lights" can be seen marking individual windows. The design and construction of [[Broadcasting House]] in the early 1930s was also affected by locals declaring their right to ancient lights. It resulted in a unique asymmetrical sloped design that allowed for sunlight to pass over the building to the residential quarters eastwards, long since demolished and now home to the new Egton Wing.

Recent case law from 2010, relating to a commercial development in the centre of Leeds ([http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2245.html ''HKRUK II v Heaney'']) has significantly changed the perceptions of risk associated with right-to-light, particularly in the context of commercial schemes.  This case upheld an injunction against a commercial property. The result of this is that many developers are now looking to work with local authorities to try to use section 237 of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]].  This potentially stops injunctions against schemes that have over-riding social or economic advantages to an area.

=== United States ===
Under [[United States tort law]], in ''[[Fontainebleau Hotel]] Corp. v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five, Inc.'' (1959) the Florida [[Appellate Court]] stated that the "ancient lights" doctrine had been unanimously repudiated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/dgolash/fontainebleau%20v.%204525.htm FOUNTAINEBLEAU HOTEL CORP., a Florida corporation, and Charnofree Corporation, a Florida corporation, Appellants, v. FORTY-FIVE TWENTY-FIVE, INC., a Florida corporation, Appellee.] @ LexisNexis Academic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.uchicago.edu/~rmcnary/briefs/property/Fontainebleau/ Case @ University of Chicago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421194453/http://home.uchicago.edu/~rmcnary/briefs/property/Fontainebleau/ |date=2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, voters in [[San Francisco]] passed Proposition K, which prevents construction of any building over 40 feet that casts a shadow on a public park, unless the Planning Commission decides the shadow is insignificant. This proposition causes problems for [[Oceanwide_Center,_San_Francisco|a proposed 34-story building south of Market Street]], which would cast a shadow on a public park ten blocks away, for one hour of the day in the fall, as well as St. Mary's Square, Justin Herman Plaza, and Union Square for significant parts of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dineen|first1=J.K.|title=Long shadows create political hurdle for S.F. skyscraper project|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Long-shadows-create-political-hurdle-for-S-F-7382467.php|accessdate=30 June 2017|publisher=SF Chronicle|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] has similar laws against the casting of shadows on [[Boston Common]], the [[Public_Garden_(Boston)|Public Garden]], and other important public open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1990/1990acts0362.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rosgen [[Stream]] Classification''' is a system for natural [[river]]s in which morphological arrangements of stream characteristics are organized into relatively homogeneous stream types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rosgen, David L. 1994. “A Classification of Natural Rivers.” ''CATENA'' 22 (3): 169–99. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/0341-8162(94)90001-9&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a widely-used method for classifying streams and rivers based on common patterns of channel morphology.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, 2018. “Fundamentals of Rosgen Stream Classification System | Watershed Academy Web | US EPA.” n.d. Accessed May 6, 2018. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://cfpub.epa.gov/watertrain/moduleFrame.cfm?parent_object_id=1189&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific objectives of this stream classification system are as follows: 1) predict a rivers behavior from its appearance; 2) develop specific [[hydrologic]] and sediment relationships for a given stream type and its state; 3) provide mechanisms to extrapolate site-specific data to stream reaches having similar characteristics; and 4) provide a consistent frame of reference for communicating stream [[River morphology|morphology]] and condition among a variety of disciplines and interested parties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These objectives are met through Rosgen's four hierarchical levels (I-IV) of river morphology.

== Hierarchy of the Rosgen Stream Classification ==

=== Level I: Geomorphic Characterization ===
Level I categorize stream types into letters A - G based on their [[geomorphic]] characteristics that result from the integration of basin relief, land form, and valley morphology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rosgen, David L. and H.L. Silvey 1996. “Applied River Morphology” Second Edition. ''Wildland Hydrology''. Pagosa Springs, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a general way in which the morphology of a stream can be described. Many of the Level I criteria can be determined through [[topographic]] and landform maps, aerial imagery, and geospatial data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Level II: Morphological Description ====
Level II characterizes stream type by using numbers 1 - 6, in addition to letters A - G, to include the assessments of the channel cross-section, longitudinal profile, and plan-form pattern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cross-section measurements include a streams entrenchment ratio, width/depth ratio, and dominant substrate. The longitudinal and plan-form measurements consist of [[slope]], stream bed features, [[sinuosity]], and [[meander]] width ratio. Level II is a quantitative morphological assessment of the stream reach which provides greater detail from data collected in the field for the implementation into land management decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Level III: Assessment of Stream Condition and Departure from its Potential ====
Level III describes the existing condition of a stream as it relates to its stability, response potential, and function.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This level includes additional measurements such as, sediment supply, channel stability, and flow regime which further describe the condition or “state” of the stream.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Level IV: Field Data Verification ====
Level IV verifies the process relationships inferred from the previous three levels of classification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The objective of this level is to determine empirical relationships for use in prediction (e.g. to develop [[Manning's n|Manning’s n]] values from measured [[velocity]])&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Applications ===
The Rosgen Stream Classification is probably best applied as a communication tool to describe channel form.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Simon A., Doyle M., Kondolf M., Shields F.D., Rhoads B., and McPhillips M. 2007. “Critical Evaluation of How the Rosgen Classification and Associated ‘Natural Channel Design’ Methods Fail to Integrate and Quantify Fluvial Processes and Channel Response1.” ''JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association'' 43 (5): 1117–31. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00091.x&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses for the Rosgen Stream Classification include fish habitat indices, surveys of [[Riparian zone|riparian]] communities, [[stream restoration]] and mitigation, engineering, evaluating livestock grazing related to stream type, and the utilization of sediment and hydraulic data by stream type.

=== Limitations ===
Problems with the use of the Rosgen Stream Classification are encountered with identifying [[Bankfull discharge|bankfull]] dimensions, particularly in [[incising]] channels and with the mixing of bed and bank sediment into a single population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Its use for engineering design and restoration may be flawed by ignoring some processes governed by [[force]] and resistance, and the imbalance between [[Sediment transport|sediment]] supply and transporting power in unstable systems&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Limitations for Level II classification involve time dependence, uncertain applicability across physical environments, difficulty in identification of a true equilibrium condition, and uncertain process significance of classification criteria.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Juracek Kyle E., and Fitzpatrick Faith A. 2007. “Limitations and Implications of Stream Classification.” ''JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association'' 39 (3): 659–70. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb03683.x&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Implications of using the Rosgen Stream Classification, include: (1) acceptance of the limitations, (2) acceptance of the risk of classifying streams incorrectly, and (3) classification results may be used inappropriately&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

From the [[social sciences]]' view, it is also a "nucleated and hierarchically nested process of political governance, economic development, social order, and cultural identity" Soja.&lt;ref&gt;''Postmetropolis: Critical Studies of Cities and Regions''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 2000, p.13-14.
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In densely settled urban places, a critical-mass provides potential for innovation that is not typically available in rural environments, therefore synekism can be thought of as the geographical relationships that create and give importance to cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9333">In transport, [[tunnel]]s can be connected together to form a '''tunnel [[transport network|network]]'''. These can be used in [[mining]] to reach [[ore]] below ground, in cities for underground [[rapid transit]] systems, in [[sewer system]]s, in [[warfare]] to avoid enemy detection or attacks, as maintenance access routes beneath sites with high ground-traffic such as [[airport]]s and [[amusement park]]s, or to extend public living areas or commercial access while avoiding outdoor weather.

==In warfare==

===Sieges===
Tunnel networks were sometimes developed during [[siege warfare]], even dating back to [[classical antiquity]]. Starting with a single tunnels being dug to undermine a wall that might be detected by the defenders and met with counter-tunnels, leading to [[tunnel warfare]]. Defenders might first create a series of underground listing posts to preempt such mining attacks.

===Trench systems===
[[File:Gros Ouvrage du Michelsberg - Hohlgang.jpg|thumb|Connecting tunnel under [[Ouvrage Michelsberg]], a fortress of the [[Maginot Line]]]]

Any time the use of [[Trench warfare|trenches]] becomes extensive, this naturally leads to connecting them with tunnel networks for safe passage both along the trench lines and with rear areas. In [[World War I#Trench warfare begins|World War I]], when given enough time and resources, the underground components of the defenses could become more extensive than those above ground.

The French [[Maginot Line]], constructed from 1929 to 1939, was a chain of fortresses, bunkers, retractable turrets, outposts, obstacles, and sunken artillery emplacements, all linked by an extensive shell-proof underground tunnel network. It included underground barracks, shelters, ammo dumps and depots, and even had its own underground [[narrow gauge]] railways.

===In Vietnam===
[[Image:VietnamCuChiTunnels.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Part of the tunnel complex at Củ Chi, this tunnel has been made wider and taller to accommodate tourists.]]
The [[Củ Chi tunnels|tunnels of Củ Chi]] are an immense network of connecting underground tunnels located in the [[Củ Chi District]] of [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon), [[Vietnam]], and are part of a much larger network of tunnels that underlie much of the country. The Củ Chi tunnels were the location of several military campaigns during the [[Vietnam War]], and were the [[Viet Cong]]'s base of operations for the [[Tết Offensive]] in 1968.&lt;br/&gt;
The tunnels were used by Viet Cong soldiers as [[secret passage|hiding spots]] during combat, as well as serving as communication and supply routes, hospitals, food and weapon caches and living quarters for numerous North Vietnamese fighters. The tunnel systems were of great importance to the Viet Cong in their resistance to American forces, and helped to counter the growing American military effort.

[[Image:The Structureplan of Vinh Moc Tunnels.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Structureplan of Vinh Moc Tunnels.]]
The [[Vịnh Mốc tunnels]] are a tunnel complex in [[Quảng Trị]], [[Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]] it was strategically located on the border of [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]. The tunnels were built to shelter people from the intense bombing of Son Trung and Son Ha communes in Vinh Linh county of [[Quảng Trị Province]] in the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]].  The American forces believed the villagers of Vinh Moc were supplying food and armaments to the North Vietnamese garrison on the island of Con Co which was in turn hindering the American bombers on their way to bomb Hanoi. The idea was to force the villagers of Vinh Moc to leave the area but as is typical in Vietnam there was nowhere else to go. The villagers initially dug the tunnels to move their village 10 metres underground but the American forces designed bombs that burrowed down 10 metres. Eventually against these odds, the villagers moved the village to a depth of 30 metres. It was constructed in several stages beginning in 1966 and used until early 1972. The complex grew to include wells, kitchens, rooms for each family and spaces for healthcare. Around 60 families lived in the tunnels; as many as 17 children were born inside the tunnels.&lt;br/&gt;
The tunnels were a success and no villagers lost their lives. The only direct hit was from a bomb that failed to explode; the resulting hole was utilized as a ventilation shaft.&lt;br/&gt;
Three levels of tunnels were eventually built.

==In terrorism==
During the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], the Israeli military uncovered and destroyed 32 cross-border tunnels that went on for miles beneath [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and reached into [[State of Israel|Israeli]] territory. According to intelligence officials, Israeli engineers are developing a system that could detect and destroy cross-border tunnels for which the Israeli government has reportedly spent more than $250 million since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel Is Building a Secret Tunnel-Destroying Weapon|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/10/israel-is-building-a-secret-tunnel-destroying-weapon-hamas-us-gaza/|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21 Hamas members killed in tunnel collapses this year|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/222621|website=israelnationalnews.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaza Tunnel Collapsed; 2 Hamas Militants Killed|url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2016/12/09/074826727/Gaza-Tunnel-Collapsed-2-Hamas-Militants-Killed|website=Tempo.co|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A network of caves beneath the cities of [[Mosul]] and [[Badana]] were built by [[ISIS]]. The terrorist group avoids battlefield engagements, preferring to hide in such tunnels safe from [[satellite]] detection, [[drone strikes]] and [[artillery]], managed to maintain supply lines and communication with other areas under their control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Logan|first1=Ross|title=Eerie pictures from inside ISIS' secret underground lair in Mosul|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/eerie-pictures-inside-isis-secret-9138284|publisher=Mirror|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massive network of Islamic State underground tunnels discovered|url=http://www.9news.com.au/world/2016/05/14/10/12/massive-network-of-islamic-state-underground-tunnels-discovered|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Daesh video shows construction of intricate tunnel network|url=http://www.albawaba.com/loop/new-daesh-video-shows-constuction-intricate-tunnel-network-870888|publisher=Al Bawaba|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retaken villages show ISIS increasingly driven underground|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/retaken-villages-show-isis-increasingly-driven-underground|website=Military Times|publisher=Military Times|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underground rabbit warrens found as IS flees|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/is-living-underground-like-rabbits-its-outside-human-behaviour/news-story/236d3e88228a4807ac31ed2e5019e400|website=NewsComAu|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The weapons Islamic State could use in the battle for Mosul|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/weapons-islamic-state-could-battle-mosul-185300040.html|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retaken villages show IS increasingly driven underground|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/10/18/retaken-villages-show-is-increasingly-driven-underground.html|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9645">The '''United States Geography Olympiad''', often abbreviated as '''USGO''', is a nationwide academic geography competition for primary and secondary school students in the United States. It was introduced during the 2012-2013 school year. It currently consist of approximately 105 National Qualifying Exam sites held around the United States and its territories, along with a certain number of international schools, and a National Championships held in Arlington, VA at the end of April. The National Qualifying Exam sites are held in conjunction with the high school-level regional and state tournaments of [[National History Bee and Bowl|The National History Bee and The National History Bowl]].

The United States Geography Olympiad is also the official qualifying competition for American students looking to qualify for the [[International Geography Olympiad]], an international geography competition, which is held every summer in a different country. The international competition consists of three parts: a written test, a multimedia test and some fieldwork-related activity. James Mullen of Cupertino, CA, won the 2014 International Geography Olympiad while the USA finished 10th out of 36 countries overall.

The United States Geography Olympiad currently includes two categories: a Junior Varsity category and a Varsity category.  For each academic school year, students who are younger than 16 years of age, as of July 1 of the summer following the school year, can participate in the Junior Varsity category - there is no younger age limit. Students who are 16 or older (up to 19), as July 1 of the summer following the school year, must participate in the Varsity category. Only students in the Varsity category are eligible to qualify for the US National Team which will participate during that summer in the International Geography Olympiad.

The US Geography Olympiad is not associated with [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] or the National Geographic Bee.

== History of the competition ==
The US Geography Olympiad was founded in the summer of 2012 under the name "United States Geography Challenge" by [[David Madden (Jeopardy! contestant)|David Madden]] and Enrico Contolini. David Madden is a former 19-day champion on Jeopardy!, who also serves as Executive Director for both The National History Bee and [[National History Bowl and Bee|The National History Bowl]]. Enrico Contolini is an engineer and self-taught geography enthusiast and researcher who coached his daughter Isabella to be the top female student nationally in the National Geographic Bee in both 2010 and 2011. The name of the competition was changed to the United States Geography Olympiad in October 2013.

Along with acting as the qualifying competition for American students looking to attend the International Geography Olympiad, the US Geography Olympiad was founded to test the geography skills of American students and to help promote geography education. The competition aims to reward students who have devoted themselves to studying the world, and its countries and peoples, as a thorough knowledge of geography is essential to being an educated citizen today. The US Geography Olympiad aims at being more than a competition, and for this reason it also runs a USGeoChallenge Facebook page where geography-related articles and news, quizzes, links to relevant websites and blogs are posted on a regular bases to foster educational discussions and opportunities for those interested in geography as a subject.

The Elementary and Middle School divisions were introduced in 2015. The Middle School division was divided into 7th and 8th grade divisions in 2016.

== Format of the competition ==
The Regional and/or State Qualifying event is currently organized as a 50 multiple-choice question written test to be completed in 20 minutes. Students may take the Qualifying Exam up to three times, as three different versions of the Exam are offered at different regional tournaments. To qualify for Nationals, students must finish in either the top half of the students in their division (Varsity or JV) at their site, or in the top 50% of students taking that particular version of the Qualifying Exam nationally. 

The National competition currently consists of three different events: A written exam, a map skills exam, and an 80 question multiple choice exam. Participants are given one hour to finish the first set of 40 multiple choice questions and the map skills exam. After a break, participants are given another hour to finish the second set of 40 multiple choice questions and the written exam. The written exam is based on the written exam at the International Geography Olympiad (iGeo), and the multiple choice exam is based on the multimedia exam at iGeo. 

After the competition, participants are given a rank score in each event, based on how their scores placed within that event. Any ties are shown by a .5 ranking; thus, a student that is tied for 1st place would have a rank score of 1.5. To determine participants' final rank, rank values in the three events are added together and ranked from greatest to least. The most favorable rank score would be 3.0, signifying that the participant ranked 1st in all three events. Rankings for Junior Varsity and Varsity divisions are separate, because the top 4 students in Varsity earn a seat in the US Team going to iGeo.

==Past locations==

The JV and Varsity Championships have always been held at the Crystal Gateway Marriott in the [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City]] neighborhood of [[Arlington, Virginia]].

In 2015, the Elementary and Middle School Championships were held at the Marriott Downtown Louisville in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]]. In 2016, the Elementary, 7th Grade, and 8th Grade Championships were held at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare in [[Rosemont, Illinois]]. The Hyatt Regency O'Hare also hosted the Elementary and Middle School Championships for 2017 on Memorial Day weekend. In 2018, the Middle School and Elementary National Championships were held at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis.
