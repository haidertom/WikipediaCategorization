'''Amedy Coulibaly''' ({{IPA-fr|amɛdi kulibali}}; 27 February 1982 – 9 January 2015) was a [[Malians in France|Malian-French]] man who was the prime suspect in the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|Montrouge shooting]], in which [[Municipal Police (France)|municipal police]] officer Clarissa Jean-Philippe was shot and killed, and was the hostage-taker and gunman in the [[Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege]], in which he killed four hostages before being killed by police.

He was a close friend of [[Charlie Hebdo shooting#Ch.C3.A9rif and Sa.C3.AFd Kouachi|Saïd and Chérif Kouachi]], the gunmen in the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], to which Coulibaly's shootings were connected.  He said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/video-appears-to-show-paris-kosher-grocery-attack-suspect-coulibaly-swearing-allegiance-to-islamic-state-1420977506|title=Islamic State Releases Video Calling Grocery Store Gunman Its ‘Soldier’|author=David Gauthier-Villars in Paris, Asa Fitch in Dubai and Raja Abdulrahim in Beirut|date=12 January 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/09/fusillade-de-montrouge-suspect-identifie-deux-nouvelles-interpellations_4552503_3224.html Le suspect de Montrouge, Amedy Coulibaly, était bien le tireur de Vincennes], ''Le Monde'' (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Coulibaly had pledged allegiance to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref name="janeonyanga-omara,usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/01/11/video-gunman-islamic-state/21589723/|title=Video shows Paris gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State|author=Jane Onyanga-Omara|date=11 January 2015|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Hayat Boumeddiene]], is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic State magazine interviews Hayat Boumeddiene|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/islamic-state-magazine-interviews-hayat-boumeddiene|website=Guardian.com|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been described by newspapers as "France's most wanted woman". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-controlled border town of [[Tell Abyad]] in Syria.

==Early life==
[[File:GrandeBornePlaineCentrale.jpg|thumb|left|260px| Coulibaly grew up on [[La Grande Borne]] housing estate.]]

==Shootings on 7–9 January 2015==
{{See also|Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege|January 2015 Île-de-France attacks#Fontenay-aux-Roses and Montrouge shootings}}
Coulibaly is said to be responsible for three shootings, and he said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt; In the shootings, five people were killed and eleven others were wounded.

The first shooting was of a jogger who was wounded on the evening of 7 January in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. Shell casings found at the scene were later linked to the weapon carried by Coulibaly in his kosher supermarket attack.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;

The second shooting occurred in [[Montrouge]] on 8 January. Clarissa Jean-Philippe, an unarmed French policewoman, was killed, and a street sweeper was critically injured. DNA found at the scene was a match to Coulibaly.&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diondassanayake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/551314/Jewish-supermarket-siege-Paris-hero-hostage-tried-to-shot-Amedy-Coulibaly|title=Jewish supermarket siege: Heroic hostage executed after trying to turn weapon on gunman |author=Dion Dassanayake|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third shooting took place at [[Porte de Vincennes]], east Paris, on 9 January. Coulibaly killed four more people, all Jewish patrons at a Jewish [[Hypercacher]] supermarket at Porte de Vincennes, at the outset of an hours-long siege in which he demanded that the Kouachi brothers be freed.&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/11/french-authorities-hunt-most-wanted-woman-in-france-fears-new-terror-attack/|title=France's most wanted woman may have traveled to Syria, reports say|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBClive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-30722098|title=Charlie Hebdo attack: Manhunt – live reporting|publisher=BBC News|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.636178|title=Paris shooting updates / Charlie Hebdo attackers take hostage after car chase|date=9 January 2015|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/11/ce-que-l-on-sait-de-l-agression-d-un-joggeur-a-fontenay-aux-roses_4553732_3224.html Ce que l'on sait de l'agression d'un joggeur à Fontenay-aux-Roses] – ''Le Monde'' –  Emeline Cazi  – 11 January 2014 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/11/paris-gunman-amedy-coulibaly-allegiance-isis|title=Paris gunman Amedy Coulibaly declared allegiance to Isis|date=11 January 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset of that attack, he introduced himself to his hostages, saying: "I am Amedy Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim.

==Aftermath==
After [[Mali]] refused to accept Coulibaly's body for burial, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Muslim section of a cemetery in [[Thiais]].&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/23/terrorist-buried-near-paris-after-mali-rejects-corpse/|title=Terrorist buried near Paris after Mali rejects corpse|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Hayat Boumeddiene]], is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She has been described by newspapers as "France's most wanted woman". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-controlled border town of [[Tell Abyad]] in Syria.

The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], which lasted from March 20 – May 1, 2003, resulted in a small number of American and [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition]] [[prisoner of war|POWs]].

==507th's wrong turn==
A majority of the prisoners of war were captured from the ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. Separated from a larger convoy, they were ambushed in the Iraqi-held town of [[Nasiriyah]] on March 23, 2003. Out of thirty-three soldiers, eleven were killed and seven captured in the fire fight. Several weapons jammed in the firefight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/world/after-the-war-inquiry-report-says-errors-and-fatigue-led-to-ambush-of-convoy.html|title=AFTER THE WAR: INQUIRY; Report Says Errors and Fatigue Led to Ambush of Convoy|last=Schmitt|first=Eric|date=7/10/2003|work=New York Times|access-date=11/3/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following soldiers were captured by Iraqi forces:

|}

==Capture==
When they surrendered, they feared the worst. Miller held out little hope for mercy. "I thought they were going to kill me," he said. "That was the first thing I asked when they captured me: 'Are 
you going to kill me?' They said no. . . . I still didn't believe them."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/14/sprj.irq.pows/index.html|title=Former POW: 'We were like Custer'|accessdate=2006-12-18 |publisher=CNN|date=April 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraqi TV Interview==
Soon after their capture, Jessica Lynch was taken to an Iraqi hospital due to her serious injuries. The other five POWs did not know about Lynch surviving until after they were released.  After their capture, the five remaining members of the ambushed 507th would become famous as bloody and beaten. They were then interviewed by Iraq TV, and the footage was shown worldwide by [[Al Jazeera]]. In the interview, [[Patrick Miller (soldier)|Private First Class Patrick Miller]] was asked why he came to Iraq; his reply was "I come to fix broke stuff." Asked if he came to shoot Iraqis, he answered, "No, I come to shoot only if I am shot at. They don't bother me, I don't bother them."
&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-23-pows-iraq-usat_x.htm|title=Iraq puts captive troops on TV|accessdate=2006-12-18 |agency=Associated Press|date=March 24, 2003|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two More Makes Eight==
On March 24, they were joined by Chief Warrant Officers David Williams, 31, and [[Ron Young (US Army officer)|Ronald Young Jr.]], 26, whose Apache chopper, from the 1-227 Helicopter Attack Battalion, had been shot down in central Iraq during the [[2003 attack on Karbala|attack on Karbala.]]

==Relocation==
The prisoners were taken to [[Baghdad]], where they were isolated in separate cells of a drab [[prison]] with concrete walls and a tin roof. As American troops got closer, the soldiers were shuffled from building to building. The Iraqi captors worked feverishly to stay one step ahead of the advancing units.

==Rescue==
As it became clear that the war was over for the Iraqis, some of their captors approached a Marine unit from the [[3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion|3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, Delta Co., 3rd Platoon]] which was a part of [[Task Force Tripoli]] that had been pushing up toward [[Tikrit]], [[Saddam Hussein]]'s hometown.  A Marine battalion was sent to check on the intelligence and found the seven POWs with a confused Iraqi guard unit, whose officers had fled.

On April 13, 2003, 21 days after the 507th members were captured, the 3rd Light Armored Recon Marines burst in on the Iraqi guards who gave up without a fight.  Ordering everyone on the floor, a Marine gave an order to "stand up if you're American!"  Given dirty prison clothes and fed little food, the prisoners lost a lot of weight and with their garb, and beards they looked like Iraqis.  "At first," [[Shoshana Johnson|Spc. Shoshana Johnson]] remembers that, "they didn't realize I was American. They said, 'Get down, get down,' and one of them said, 'No, she's American.' "&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/04/14/MN252903.DTL|title=Freedom for 7 American POWs|accessdate=2006-12-18 |last=Peter Baker, Washington Post|date=
April 14, 2003|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours, the seven were on their way to Kuwait International Airport inside a Marine Corps KC-130 transport plane, the first stop before the United States. Amid sobs, cheers and laughter, they told their stories to two reporters accompanying them on the flight.  "I broke down. I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm home,'" Johnson said.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

==War crimes==
During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Iraqi [[Saddam Fedayeen]] irregular forces were involved in executing several Coalition prisoners of war.

Sergeant [[Donald Walters]] was initially reported to have been killed in the March 23 ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. However, witnesses later reported that they had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters' blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/05/27/iraq.pow/index.html Status changed for soldier killed in Iraq: Investigation shows POW was murdered - CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Lynch]] was reportedly raped and sodomized by Iraqi forces, based on scars, though she has no recollection of it happening.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/07/usa.iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on March 23, a British Army engineering unit made a wrong turn near the town of [[Az Zubayr]], which was still held by Iraqi forces. The unit was ambushed and Sapper Luke Allsopp and Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth became separated from the rest. Both were captured and executed by Iraqi forces. In 2006, a video of Allsopp lying on the ground surrounded by Iraqi irregular forces was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1530205/Soldier-killed-in-convoy-ambush-'was-alive-for-four-hours-surrounded-by-mob'.html Soldier killed in convoy ambush 'was alive for four hours surrounded by mob' - The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine Sergeant Fernando Padilla-Ramirez was reported missing from his supply unit after an ambush north of [[Nasiriyah]] on March 28. His body was later dragged through the streets of [[Ash Shatrah]] and hung in the town square. His body was later taken down and buried by sympathetic locals. His body was discovered by American forces on April 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special45/articles/profiles-part1.html |title=Invasion: Into the breach |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2006-08-04 |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID%3D3750 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910142414/http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=3750 |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright 2004, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the showing of captured soldiers on television, as was done with some of the captured soldiers of the [[507th Maintenance Company]], was a violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Apocryphal biographies in the ''Dictionary of National Biography''}}
There are '''apocryphal biographies''' in the first edition (1885–1900) of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (DNB), a major work on historical biography related to the [[United Kingdom]]. In other words, there is a biography that presents a life of a person asserted to have existed, but (in the light of later scholarship) the evidence for the person having lived has become regarded as tenuous or non-existent.

Examples are in [[:s:Category:Apocryphal biographies]], based on the updated ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (ODNB), where the corresponding article casts serious doubt on the DNB assertions.

==Kirkman Finlay==
'''Kirkman Finlay'''—supposed: (''c.'' 1802&amp;ndash;1828) was an alleged Scottish [[philhellene]].

The DNB has an article on this man,{{sfn|Goodwin|1889|p=32}} but more modern scholarship refutes its credibility. Monica Clough in the 21st century ODNB explains how the original source for the DNB probably confused fact with fiction and concludes by citing and quoting C. R. Fay (1951):
{{quote|
Perhaps, unless new evidence is found, more reliable than the obituary in the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' of April 1828 which called him into being,{{sfn|Gentlemen's Magazine staff|1828|p=372}} 'the second quite imaginary Kirkman Finlay of the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] "who was neither killed in Greece nor born anywhere"' can be safely buried.|Monica Clough&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clough|2004}} citing C. R. Fay, Huskisson and his age (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Robert Bruce (died 1094?) ==
Robert de Brus [Bruce] supposed nobleman, based on late medieval lists of those who fought at Hastings,{{sfn|Mackay|1886|p=114}} which are wholly unreliable.{{sfn|Cownie |2004}}

==Macduff 'thane' of Fife==
"A half or wholly mythical personage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle=Macduff |first=Thomas Finlayson |last=Henderson |volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; If he is not a literary invention, then he represents a supporter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], descended from [[Dub, King of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Dauvit|last= Broun|title=Dubh  (d. 966)|id= 8166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeJesus was taken under the impression that she was being dropped off, and trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. Because no one witnessed DeJesus's abduction, an [[AMBER Alert]] was not issued, which angered DeJesus's father.

==Captivity==
After Knight's kidnapping, Castro took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women "speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a [[prisoner of war]], of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]], of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom". The women were kept in locked upstairs bedrooms, where they were forced to use plastic toilets that were "emptied infrequently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/ariel_castro_sentencing_memo_r.html |title=Ariel Castro sentencing memorandum filed by prosecutors |last1=Krouse |first1=Peter |date=July 31, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804045034/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/ariel_castro_sentencing_memo_r.html |archivedate=August 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were fed one meal a day, and allowed to shower twice a week at most.&lt;ref name=cnn080213&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/01/justice/ohio-cleveland-castro-home |title=Deception, threats and abuse: Captives' hellish life inside Castro's home |last1=Botelho |first1=Greg |date=August 2, 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805195802/http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/01/justice/ohio-cleveland-castro-home |archivedate=August 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight told police that Castro had impregnated her at least five times, and had induced [[miscarriage]]s each time through beatings: hitting with [[dumbbell]]s, punching, and slamming her against walls.

He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: "I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130806234708/http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 6, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro spoke for 20 minutes in court, read what he said here |date=August 1, 2013 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=August 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: "You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us... I can forgive you, but I will never forget."&lt;ref name=pd130801/&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Survivors===
On July 9, 2013, Knight, Berry, and DeJesus broke their public silence for the first time since their rescue by releasing a video statement thanking the public for their support. An attorney for Berry and DeJesus said the women "still have a strong desire for privacy" and did not wish to speak to the media about their ordeal.&lt;ref name=pd070913&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/amanda_berry_gina_dejesus_and_2.html |title=New video: Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, Cleveland's 3 missing women, thank you for your support |last1=Caniglia |first1=John |date=July 9, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710092111/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/amanda_berry_gina_dejesus_and_2.html |archivedate=July 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/transcript-cleveland-kidnapping-victims-say-thank-for-support |title=TRANSCRIPT: Cleveland kidnapping victims say thank you for support |last1=Steer |first1=Jen |date=July 9, 2013 |publisher=newsnet5.com |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711210648/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/transcript-cleveland-kidnapping-victims-say-thank-for-support |archivedate=July 11, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cleveland Courage Fund, a bank account set up to help the women in their transition to independent life, had collected approximately $1.05&amp;nbsp;million at the time of the video's release.&lt;ref name=pd070913/&gt; Before Berry's disappearance, her grandfather had promised to give her a classic [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] from the year Berry was born.

===House demolition===
[[File:Seymour Avenue - panoramio.jpg|thumbnail|right|The site on Seymour Avenue in 2014.]]
As part of the plea bargain, the house where Castro lived, and where he had held the women captive, was demolished on August 7, 2013. Knight was present and handed out yellow balloons, which she said represented missing children, to the gathered crowd. The balloons were released before DeJesus's aunt began the demolition with a swing of a [[crane (machine)|crane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cleveland-house-horrors-destroyed-demolition-crews-tear-ariel-castro-home-article-1.1419792 |title=Cleveland house of horrors destroyed — demolition crews tear down Ariel Castro's home |last1=Kemp |first1=Joe |date=August 7, 2013 |newspaper=NY Daily News |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810195725/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cleveland-house-horrors-destroyed-demolition-crews-tear-ariel-castro-home-article-1.1419792 |archivedate=August 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-kidnapper-ariel-castros-house-horrors-demolished/story?id=19890927 |title=Cleveland Kidnapper Ariel Castro's 'House of Horrors' Demolished |last1=Ng |first1=Christina |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810182609/http://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-kidnapper-ariel-castros-house-horrors-demolished/story?id=19890927 |archivedate=August 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_cuyahoga/michelle-knight-held-captive-for-decade-by-ariel-castro-hands-out-yellow-balloons-on-seymour-avenue |title=Michelle Knight held captive for decade by Ariel Castro hands out yellow balloons on Seymour Avenue |last1=Seitz |first1=Colleen |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=newsnet5.com |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810222225/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_cuyahoga/michelle-knight-held-captive-for-decade-by-ariel-castro-hands-out-yellow-balloons-on-seymour-avenue |archivedate=August 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Castro's death ===
On the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence, Castro was found hanging with a bed sheet in his detention cell at the [[Correctional Reception Center]] in [[Orient, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="AP suicide"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |title=Cleveland man's suicide brings little sympathy |last1=Sheeran |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Welsh-Huggins |first2=Andrew |date=September 4, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20131004072333/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison staff performed [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Castro before he was taken to the [[Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University|Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Jim|title=Ariel Castro dies in apparent suicide|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906090516/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|archivedate=September 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |last1=Mungin |first1=Lateef |last2=Alsup |first2=Dave |publisher=CNN |date=September 4, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro, Cleveland kidnapper, found hanged in prison cell |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JNhFIjnY?url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] [[coroner]] Dr. Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary [[autopsy]] had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging.&lt;ref name="usatoday-Eversley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eversley|first=Melanie|title=The Ohio kidnapper was not on suicide watch, but was checked on every 30 minutes by guards.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904195004/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|archivedate=September 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2013, the [[Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction]] released a report that suggested Castro may have died accidentally from auto-[[erotic asphyxiation]] rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castro suicide report: Officers falsified reports|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=October 10, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010150554/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|archivedate=October 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was not on [[suicide watch]] at the time of his death, but had been subject to routine checks every thirty minutes due to his notoriety.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;

A consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that "all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment." The [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="suiciderpt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |title=Consultants: Kidnapper Ariel Castro's death a suicide |last=Welsh-Huggins |first1=Andrew |date=December 3, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206061146/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]] wrote [[Confessions (Augustine)|''Confessions'']], the first Western autobiography ever written, around 400. Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century.]]
An '''autobiography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]], αὐτός-''autos'' self +  βίος-''bios'' life + γράφειν-''graphein'' to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word "autobiography" was first used deprecatingly by [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]] in 1797 in the [[English language|English]] [[Periodical publication|periodical]] ''The [[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'', when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as "pedantic". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by [[Robert Southey]] in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that "[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time".&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;{{cite book|last = Pascal| first = Roy|title = Design and Truth in Autobiography|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1960 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] | pages = | url =| doi =| id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The [[memoir]] form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life.&lt;ref name=Pascal/&gt; 

''See also: [[List of autobiographies]] and [[:Category:Autobiographies]] for examples.''

== Biography ==
=== Life ===

Autobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.

=== Spiritual autobiography ===
Spiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as [[Zahid Rohari]]'s ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|An Autobiography]]'' and ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]''. The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.

=== Memoirs ===
{{Main article|Memoir}}

A memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the "life and times" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', also known as ''Commentaries on the Gallic Wars''. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the [[Gallic Wars]]. His second memoir, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (or ''Commentaries on the Civil War'') is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in [[Caesar's civil war|the civil war]] against [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Gnaeus Pompeius]] and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. 

[[Leonor López de Córdoba]] (1362–1420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir [[Edmund Ludlow]] and Sir [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet|John Reresby]]. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of [[Jean François Paul de Gondi, cardinal de Retz|Cardinal de Retz]] (1614–1679) and the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]].

=== Fictional autobiography ===
The term "fictional autobiography" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is an early example. [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' is another such classic, and [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., [[Robert Nye]]'s ''Memoirs of [[Lord Byron]]''.

=== The classical period: Apologia, oration, confession ===

In antiquity such works were typically entitled ''[[wikt:apology|apologia]],'' purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. [[John Henry Newman]]'s Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in reference to this tradition.

The Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] introduces his autobiography (''Josephi Vita'', c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mason, Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary. Life of Josephus : translation and commentary, Volume 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] [[Libanius]] (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (''Oration I'' begun in 374) as one of his [[Public speaking|orations]], not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430) applied the title ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' to his autobiographical work, and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] used the same title in the 18th century,  initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era and beyond.  Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. It tells of the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage [[Manichaeism]] in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to [[Christianity]] due to his embracement of [[philosophical scepticism|Skepticism]] and the [[New Academy]] movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology&lt;ref&gt;Fiorenza and Galvin (1991), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Confessions'' will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Henry|title=Confessions|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199537822|pages=4 (ix)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of Augustine's ''Confessions'' is the 12th-century ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' of [[Peter Abelard]], outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.

=== Early autobiographies ===

[[File:Baburnama.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the ''[[Baburnama]]'']]

In the 15th century, [[Leonor López de Córdoba]], a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her ''Memorias'', which may be the first autobiography in [[Spanish language|Castillian]].

[[Babur|Zāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur]], who founded the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] of [[South Asia]] kept a journal ''[[Baburnama|Bāburnāma]]'' ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]/{{lang-fa|بابر نامہ}}; literally: ''"Book of Babur"'' or ''"Letters of Babur"'') which was written between 1493 and 1529.

One of the first great autobiographies of the [[Renaissance]] is that of the sculptor and goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply ''Vita'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Life''). He declares at the start: "No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty."&lt;ref&gt;Benvenuto Cellini, tr. George Bull, ''The Autobiography'', London 1966 p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.

Another autobiography of the period is ''De vita propria'', by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1574).

It is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|Book of Margery Kempe]]'', describing among other things [[Margery Kempe|Kempe's]] pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] and visit to [[Rome]] although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.

Possibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captan John Smith's autobiography published in 1630 &lt;ref&gt;The True Travels, Adventures and Observations of Captain John Smith into Europe, Aisa, Africa and America from Anno Domini 1593 to 1629&lt;/ref&gt; which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's "tall tales", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted. &lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Philip L (1964) The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Other notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] (1643, published 1764) and [[John Bunyan]] (''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'', 1666).

[[Jarena Lee]] (1783 – 1864), was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Doers_of_the_Word.html?id=jrirQL5L0xgC|title=Doers of the Word: African-American Women Speakers and Writers in the North (1830-1880)|last=Peterson|first=Carla L.|date=1998|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813525143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
[[File:Memoirs of Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of the first English edition of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s autobiography, 1793]]
Following the trend of [[Romanticism]], which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. [[Stendhal]]'s autobiographical writings of the 1830s, ''[[The Life of Henry Brulard]]'' and ''[[Memoirs of an Egotist]]'', are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Stendhal|last=Wood|first=Michael|date=1971|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801491245|location=Ithaca, NY|page=97}}&lt;!--|access-date=July 21, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An English example is [[William Hazlitt]]'s ''Liber Amoris'' (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.

With the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], but also politicians (e.g. [[Henry Brooks Adams]]), philosophers (e.g. [[John Stuart Mill]]), churchmen such as [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], and entertainers such as [[P. T. Barnum]]. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of "Cellinian" autobiography.
&lt;!-- work in progress—to be developed --&gt;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
From the 17th century onwards, "scandalous memoirs" by supposed [[libertine]]s, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically [[pseudonym]]ous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by [[ghostwriter]]s. So-called "autobiographies" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a [[ghostwriter]], are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as [[Naomi Campbell]], admit to not having read their "autobiographies".{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.

Autobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. ''[[A Fortunate Life]]'' by [[Albert Facey]] (1979) has become an Australian literary classic.&lt;ref&gt;about-australia.com.au, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as ''[[Angela’s Ashes]]'' and ''[[The Color of Water]]'', more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.

A genre where the "claim for truth" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is [[autofiction]].

Furthermore, in the latter years new impulses at the Autobiographical genre arrived from the italian poet and critic Menotti Lerro. In contrast to what Philippe Lejeune asserts Lerro claims that if the truth can only be grasped in a synchronic manner (also according to postmodernist philosophers point of view) and through fragments, why not entrust this narrative to the verse? Why not consider the role of “autobiography in verse” equally dignified as a form of self-narration? For the critic this, perhaps, is the necessary leap: through poetry it is possible to get the most dramatic and highest form of autobiographical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Menotti Lerro, Autobiographical Poetry in England and Spain (1950-1980): Narrating Oneself in Verse (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2017), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bezerenbam''' (or '''Bazaram-bam''') and '''Mişelav''' were the [[Wallachia]]n (Romanian) leaders&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 552"&gt;Xenopol, p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Djuvara, cited article"&gt;Djuvara, cited article.&lt;/ref&gt; (the former a "[[Ban (title)|ban]]" according to Xenopol, Hasdeu and Constantin C. Giurescu) mentioned in 1241, in the Persian chronicle [[Jami' al-tawarikh|Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh]] written by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (Fazel-Ullah-Raschid). They appear in the context of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]. The former's army was located in ''Ilaut country'', as the chronicle says:

:''In the middle of the spring (1240), the princes crossed the (...) mountains to enter in the country of Bulars and Bashguirds. Orda, who marched on the right, passing through Ilaut country, met (Bezerenbam?) with an army; the latter has been defeated. Cardan and Buri went against the Sassans,&lt;ref&gt;"They were probably the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] who were living in the Eastern provinces of Hungary, and were attacked by prince Cardan." (author's note)&lt;/ref&gt; and  defeated them after three battles. Budjek crossed the mountains of that country in order to enter in Cara-Ulag (probably [[Transylvania]] and [[Wallachia]]), defeated the Ulags ([[Vlachs]]), crossed the (...) mountains, and entered in the country of (Mişelav?), where he beat the awaiting enemy.''.&lt;ref&gt;[[d'Ohsson]] p. 627 - 628.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, ''History of the Romanians'', [[Alexandru D. Xenopol]] considers that it is possible for Bezerenbam, or Basarab the [[Ban (title)|ban]],&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; to be the same person as [[Litovoi]], mentioned in a document from 1247 as ruler of the same [[Oltenia|land]].&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 552"/&gt; He considers Bazaram-bam is an ancestor of the Romanian dynasty of Basarab &lt;ref&gt;Les Roumains au moyen-age: une énigme historique By Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol, Publisher: Paris, E. Leroux, 1885 OCLC Number:	4153032&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] also thinks that the leader was "Basarab the [[Ban (title)|ban]]", a local leader, while [[Constantin C. Giurescu]] considers that this name was a distorted form of the title of [[Banat of Severin|Ban of Severin]] (Terra Zeurino).&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neagu Djuvara]] has considered the possibility that Mişelav was [[Seneslau]],&lt;ref name="Djuvara, cited article"/&gt; another Wallachian leader contemporary with and neighbouring Litovoi.

'''Biographical evaluation''' ({{lang-ar|عِلْمُ الرِّجال|`Ilm al-Rijāl}}), literally meaning'' 'Knowledge of Men' ''but more commonly understood as the ''Science of Narration'', refers to a discipline of [[Islam|Islamic]] religious studies within [[hadith terminology]] in which the narrators of [[hadith]] are evaluated. Its goal is to distinguish [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]] and [[Hadith terminology#Hasan|reliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] from [[Hadith terminology#Da'if|unreliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] in establishing the credibility of the narrators, using both historic and religious knowledge.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 101, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; ''`Ilm ar-rijal'' is synonymous with what is commonly referred to as ''al-jarḥ wa al-taʻdīl'' (discrediting and accrediting) – the criticism and declared acceptance of hadith narrators.{{#tag:ref|Al-[[al-Suyuti|Suyūṭī]] mentioned in the chapter of ''Tadrib al-Rawi'' entitled 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable': "''al-Jarḥ wa al-Taʻdīl'' is permissible..."&lt;ref name= "tadrib" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name= "tadrib"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', vol. 2, p. 495, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=[[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;}}

In his ''[[Introduction to the Science of Hadith]]'', [[Ibn al-Salah]], a renowned [[hadith]] specialist, explained the importance of the study of hadith narrators. Introducing the chapter entitled, 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable,' [[Ibn al-Salah]] said, "This is from the most distinguished and noble types (of hadith study) as it results in recognizing the authenticity of a hadith or its weakness."&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, published with ''Muhasin al-Istilah'' by al-Bulqini, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 654, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; He then explained that any criticism directed at a narrator was permissible due to the "maintenance of the [[Sharia]]h, purging it of any mistakes or misinformation".&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

Stressing the importance of biographical evaluation, [[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."{{#tag:ref|The other half of knowledge, according to Ibn al-Madini, is "having understanding of the meanings of hadith".&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam"&gt;''Siyar 'Alam al-Nubala’'', by [[al-Dhahabi]], vol. 11, p. 48, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, 11th edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The following [[Qur'an]]ic verse established a general principal in '''biographical evaluation''':&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt; "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"/&gt;}}

===Beginning of narrator evaluation===
The [[Qur'an]]ic verses are numerous that praise the Companions and criticize the hypocrites, both as a group and specific individuals from amongst them–as well as criticism of specific individuals other than the hypocrites. The most well-known of these is a verse of the Quran stating, "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"&gt;The [[Qur'an|Quran]], ''Surah al-Hujarat'', 6th verse.&lt;/ref&gt; While this verse was revealed regarding a particular individual, it is a general principle. Following this example, were the Prophet and then His [[Sahaba|Companions]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"&gt;''ʻIlm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', by al-Mu'allimee, pp. 18–20, Dar al-Rayah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time of the Companions===
While many [[Sahaba|Companions]] narrated [[hadith]], according to [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them, who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent. They were: [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar|Abdullah ibn Umar]], [[Aisha]], [[Jabir ibn Abd-Allah|Jabir ibn Abdullah]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] and [[Anas ibn Malik]] with [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] being the most prolific of them.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 492, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn al-Salah]] the most prolific narrators from the [[Sahaba|Companions]] was [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] followed by [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"/&gt;

In spite of the Companions' efforts in narrating their [[hadith]], there was no need for them to evaluate each other's narrating capabilities or trustworthiness. This is because, as [[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the [[Sahaba|Companions]] to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Kifayah'', by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, p. 46, ''Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah'', Beirut, Lebanon, 1988; this edition is apparently based upon the original Indian printing.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the [[Tabi'un|Followers]] with some criticism of specific individuals from them.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

===After the Companions===
As for the [[Tabi'un|Followers]], the generation following the [[Sahaba|Companions]], their praise of narrators was plentiful, while disparagement from them was seldom. Those narrators who were criticized from the Followers were not criticized for [[Hadith terminology#Mawdo|fabricating hadith]], but, instead, due to heresy, such as the [[Kharijites]], or due to weak memory or due to their condition as narrators being unknown.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

Evaluating the narrators of [[hadith]] began in the generation following that of the Companions based upon the statement of Muhammad [[Ibn Sirin]], "They did not previously inquire about the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|''isnad]]''. However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, 'Name for us your narrators.' So the people of the [[Sunnah]] would have their hadith accepted and the people of [[Bid‘ah|innovation]] would not."&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Muslim in the introduction to his [[Sahih Muslim|''Sahih]]'', vol. 1, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''turmoil'' referred to is the conflicting ideologies of the Kharijites and extreme [[Shia Islam|Shias]] that had emerged at the time of the third ''khalifas'' [[Uthman ibn Affan]]'s assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, [[Ali]] and [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]].&lt;ref&gt;This is the explanation provided by al-Qurtubi in ''al-Mufhim'', vol. 1, pgs. 122-3 as quoted in ''Qurrah Ayn Al-Muhtaj'', vol. 2, pg 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Bidayah wa Al-Nihayah'', by [[Ibn Kathir]], vol. 10, p. 323, ''Dar Alam al-Kutub''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following generation, [[Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in|that after the Followers]], and afterward, the weak, unacceptable narrators increased in number, necessitating that a group of scholars clarify the condition of the narrators and distinguishing any narrations that were not [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

====Early specialists====
According to [[Ibn al-Salah]], quoting an early religious authority, the first to specialize in the study of [[hadith]] narrators was [[Shuʿba Ibn al-Ḥajjāj]], followed by Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan and then [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] and [[Yahya ibn Ma'in]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"/&gt; Al-Bulqini added some names to the aforementioned: [[Ali ibn al-Madini]] and 'Amr ibn 'Ali al-Fallas, and then mentioned [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[Hisham ibn Urwah]] as having preceded them in evaluating narrators.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

== Overview ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision.}}

===Narrator criteria===
A [[hadith]] is subject to criticism on the basis of two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith's [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]]; if there is [[Hadith terminology#Categories of discontinuity|discontinuity]] between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the [[hadith terminology]] article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]] of a particular hadith.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', by Ibn Ḥajr, published as ''an-Nukat'', p. 108, ''Dar Ibn al-Jawzi'', Dammam, Saudi Arabia, sixth edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]] narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from the definition of a hadith that is [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|''sahih]]'' constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (''al-ʻadālah''), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (''al-taqwā'') and maintaining proper social graces (''al-murūʼah''). The second, precision (''al-ḍabṭ''), is of two types, the first is pertaining to memorization and the second to writing. Precision in memorization (''ḍabṭ al-ṣadr'') refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (''ḍabṭ al-kitāb'') is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grounds for criticism===
The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision. [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] identified and enumerated ten qualities in which a narrator could be criticized. Five relate to trustworthiness and the other five to precision; however, he presented these ten qualities in order according to severity:
# A narrator intentionally lying, claiming a statement to be a Prophetic [[hadith]] when it is not. The inclusion of a narrator of a hadith as such renders that hadith [[Hadith terminology#Maw.E1.B8.8D.C5.AB.CA.BB|fabricated (''Mawḍūʻ'')]].
# An accusation of fabricating a hadith. This would be due a narration that clearly contradicts established religious principles originating from the direction (as it pertains to that hadith's chain of narration) of that individual. Or, that a narrator is known to lie in his ordinary speech but not while narrating hadith.
# Plenitude of mistakes in a narrator's hadith.
# Lack of attention to accuracy.
# The commission of wrongdoing by statement or action as long as it does not constitute apostasy.
# Misconception due to narrating on the basis of misunderstanding.
# Contradiction of that narrator's hadith of another established narrator.
# Unspecification of that narrator's standing in their narrating capabilities.
# [[Bid‘ah|Heresy]], being the belief in an innovated matter that contradicts the established religious practice originating with the Prophet due to a misconception, not obstinateness.
# Poor memory, differing from number three above in that the mistakes of that narrator outnumber instances in which they are correct.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', pgs. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of evaluation===
[[Hadith]] scholars of the past employed various methods by which to evaluate the narrating abilities of a narrator. From these means are the following:
# Observing that narrator's religiosity and asking others about it.
# Requesting the narrator in question to narrator from a particular living scholar and then returning to that scholar and comparing his narrations with those of the narrator under examination.
# If the narrator narrates from a deceased scholar, inquiring when he, the narrator in question, was born, when he met that scholar and where and then comparing the dates provided in his response to the recognized dates of that scholars death and travels. So, perhaps, the dates provided by the narrator may contradict the established dates, for example, claiming that he heard from a particular scholar after the recognized death of that scholar.
# Comparing the narrations of the narrator with those of narrators of established reliability, comparing them seeking any distinctions that might be unique to that narrator, in particular, while contradicting the others.
# Examination of the narrations either written or memorized by that narrator after the passage of time observing any discrepancies with their initial narrations.&lt;ref&gt;''Ilm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', pp. 22–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deliberately altering the wording of a hadith or more for the purpose of examining the ability of the narrator being examined to detect those alterations. This is considered an acceptable practice as long as those alterations are brought to light following the examination process.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', [ 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation terminology ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator...}}

As a result of the evaluation of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (''taʻdīl'') and those that constitute criticism (''jarḥ''). [[al-Suyuti|al-Suyūṭī]] gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that [[al-Dhahabi]] and [[Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-'Iraqi]] added an additional level and [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] one above that. Thus according to al-Suyūṭī, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suyūṭī described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the least severe and concluding with the most severe criticism.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', by al-Suyūṭī, vol. 1, pp. 573-8, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', Riyadh, first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of praise===
#[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] held that the highest level of praise was expressed was through the use of the superlative, for example, ''the most established of the people'' (''athbat al-nās''), or ''the most reliable of the people'' (''awthaq al-nās'').
#Al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi were of the opinion that the highest level was the repetition of adjective, or adjectives, in praising a narrator. For example, ''reliably reliable'' (''thiqah thiqah''), or ''reliable, firm'' (''thiqah thabt'').
#The highest level according to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah the highest is the use of a single adjective in describing a narrator. Examples of this are: ''reliable'' (''thiqah''), ''precise'' (''mutqin'') or ''firm'' (''thabt'').
#''Trustworthy'' (''ṣadūq'') and ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') are both examples of the next category to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah while al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi consider the latter term to be from the next level.
#Next is ''respectable'' ([[Sheikh#Religious usage|''shaykh]]'') along with ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') according to some. This level would also be inclusive of an individual accused of heresy.
#The lowest of the levels of praise is, for example, ''satisfactory in hadith'' (''ṣāliḥ al-ḥadīth''), meaning according to [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]], this includes ''acceptable'' (''maqbūl'') meaning, when supported by other narrators.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As he explained in the introduction to ''Taqrib al-Tahthib'', pp. 14, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, first edition, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of criticism===
#The least severe level for the criticism of a narrator is ''soft in hadith'' (''layyin al-ḥadīth'') and, according to al-'Iraqi, ''they have spoken about him'' (''takallamū fīhi''). This level would also be taken into consideration as a corroborating narrator, but at a level less than the lowest level of praise.
#Next is ''he is not strong'' (''laysa bi l-qawī''). The hadith of a narrator determined to be at this level would also be taken into consideration, as with the previous level, however, this narrator is weaker than one of the previous level.
#More severe than ''he is not strong'' is ''weak in hadith'' (''ḍaʻīf al-ḥadīth''), however, none of these first three categories are rejected outright.
#The fourth of the levels of severity of criticism includes terms such as: ''his hadith is rejected'' (''rudd al-ḥadīth'') and ''very weak'' (''ḍaʻīf jiddan'').
#The fifth includes terms such as: ''his hadith is abandoned'' (''matrūk al-ḥadīth'') and ''destroyed'' (''hālik'').
#From the most severe level of terms of criticism are: ''compulsive liar'' (''kadhdhāb''), ''he lies'' (''yakdhib'') and ''fabricator'' (''waḍḍāʻ'') among other terms.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;

The '''biographical novel''' is a [[genre]] of [[novel]] which provides a [[fiction]]al account of a contemporary or historical person's life. This kind of novel concentrates on the experiences a person had during his lifetime, the people they met and the incidents which occurred. Like other forms of [[biographical fiction]], details are often trimmed or reimagined to meet the artistic needs of the fictional genre, the [[novel]]. These reimagined biographies are sometimes called '''semi-biographical novels''', to distinguish the relative [[historicity]] of the work from other biographical novels 

Some biographical novels bearing only superficial resemblance to the historical novels or introducing elements of other [[Genre fiction|genres]] that supersede the retelling of the historical narrative, for example ''[[Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter (novel)|Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter]]'' follows the plot devices of a [[vampire fiction]] closely.  Biographical fiction often also falls within the genres of [[historical fiction]] or [[alternative history]].

Some novels that are known best for their fictional prowess, but include extensive biographical information that is less obvious to readers. A very good example of this kind is Goldsmith's "[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]" and is believed to be the biography of a  person the author had known and observed very closely. 

Biographical novels are frequently the foundation for [[film adaptations]] into the filmographic genre of [[biographical film]].

For more reflection on the different types of biographical information used in literature, see [[Biography in literature]].

[[File:STATUE OF BLONDELL NEAR DURNSTEIN IN THE WACHAU VALLEY.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Statue of Blondel near [[Durnstein]]]]
'''Blondel de Nesle''' – either '''Jean I of Nesle''' (c. 1155 – 1202) or his son '''Jean II of Nesle''' (died 1241) – was a [[France|French]] [[trouvère]].

The name 'Blondel de Nesle' is attached to twenty-four or twenty-five courtly songs. He was identified in 1942, by [[Holger Dyggve]], as Jean II of Nesle (near [[Amiens]]), who was nicknamed 'Blondel' for his long blond hair. He married at the time of his father's death in 1202, and that same year, went on the [[Fourth Crusade]]; he later fought in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. However, in 1994, [[Yvan Lepage]] suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the [[Third Crusade]], which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]].

If the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. (The melody of "L'amours dont sui espris" is used in ''[[Carmina Burana]]'', for the song "Procurans Odium"). His works are fairly conventional, and several have been recorded in modern times.

==Legend==
By 1260, Blondel's name had become attached to a legend in the highly fictionalised ''Récits d'un Ménestrel de Reims''; this claimed that, after King Richard of England was arrested and held for ransom in 1192, he was found by the [[minstrel]] Blondel, whom he saw from his window, and to whom he sang a verse of a song they both knew. Later versions of the story related that Blondel went from castle to castle, singing a particular song that only he and Richard knew, and that the imprisoned Richard replied with the second verse – thus identifying where he was imprisoned. Then, Blondel either aided the king's escape or reported his position back to his friends. Blondel finally found Richard at [[Dürnstein]]; in fact, there was no mystery about Richard's location which was widely publicized by his ransomers.

'Blondel' is a common [[surname]] on the [[Channel Island]] of [[Guernsey]]. It is recorded that King Richard granted a [[fief]] on the island to a [[vassal]] named Blondel, but it remains uncertain as to whether this has any connection with the legend, or whether the legend has any connection with the known trouvère.

==Modern versions==
The legend of Blondel did not achieve great popularity in the [[Middle Ages]], but was taken up in the late eighteenth century. It was the basis of [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Richard Coeur-de-lion (opera)|Richard Coeur-de-lion]]'' (1784). In 1822, [[Eleanor Anne Porden]] used the legend in her epic poem ''Cœur De Lion'': in her version, Blondel is really Richard's wife, [[Berengaria of Navarre]], in disguise.

A poem by Johann Gabriel Seidl titled Blondel's Lied was set to music by [[Robert Schumann]].

Throughout the nineteenth century, the legend became a key component in the mythology surrounding Richard. Some later twentieth century novelists,  placed a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] interpretation on his supposed relationship with the king. [[Norah Lofts]] in ''The Lute Player'' (1951) has Richard make a (rather gentlemanly ) approach to Blondel, which is refused, Blondel's  heart and devotion being entirely given to Richard's neglected wife Berengaria. 

In the 1962–63 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] British television series ''[[Richard the Lionheart (TV series)|Richard the Lionheart]]'', Blondel was a semi-regular character, played by [[Iain Gregory]].

The English acoustic band of the early 1970s, [[Amazing Blondel]], was named after Blondel.

The legend inspired ''[[Blondel (musical)|Blondel]]'', a 1983 [[musical theater|musical]] by [[Stephen Oliver (composer)|Stephen Oliver]] and [[Tim Rice]]. The play, a comedic [[rock opera]], is set during the period of the [[Third Crusade]]. Blondel is portrayed as a frustrated artist, seeking fame as a composer and performer, even as he searches for his imprisoned monarch. Rice collaborated with director [[Patrick Wilde]] to revive the show at the Pleasance Theatre in London in 2006.

The '''Bolton 7''' were a group of [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] men who were convicted on 12 January 1998 before Judge Michael Lever at [[Bolton]] Crown Court of the offences of gross indecency under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] and of [[age of consent]] offences under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Although [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was partially decriminalised by the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] which was 18 at the time. 

==Offences==
Under the provisions of the 1967 Act, the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was different from that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Equivalent [[heterosexual]] behaviour was not a crime.&lt;ref name=Dearden1999 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dearden | first = Nick | title = The Queen and the 'Bolton Seven' | journal = [[Feminist Legal Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 317-332 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1009218800557 | date = October 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009218800557 | quote= This note examines the case of a group of gay men who, having engaged in consensual sexual acts together, became known as the `Bolton Seven’ following their conviction in 1998 for offences of buggery and/or gross indecency. More particularly the note scrutinises the implications of the ages of the participants (one of whom, at 17 , was unable to give lawful consent to sexual intercourse with a man) in the light of the enactment of Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which introduces a system of compulsory registration by some convicted and cautioned sex offenders with the police (including men convicted of, or cautioned for, buggery or gross indecency). The note explores the justification for inclusion of these offences within the remit of the 1997 Act together with the cultural construction of gay men as predatory and as constituting a risk to younger members of society. It also analyses some of the effects of the registration requirement in terms of it constituting a potential violation of fundamental rights such as equality and respect for private life. This discussion is located particularly within the context of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the U.K. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.

During [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given [[probation]] and [[community service]] orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year [[suspended sentence|suspended prison sentence]] and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the [[age of consent]] offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.

Despite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a  result of a high-profile campaign led by gay [[human rights]] group [[OutRage!]]. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and [[human rights]] groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, [[Amnesty International]], pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.

==Aftermath==
In 2000, six of the men appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8  of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.

Legislation subsequently introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government has broadly equalised the treatment of [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] behaviours in criminal law. The [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] equalised the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] with that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] which is now 16 for both. The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and [[buggery]] have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a [[crime in the United Kingdom]].

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Galahad]], Bors the Younger, and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail ([[Edward Burne-Jones]] C. 1895)]]

'''Bors''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|z}}; {{lang-fr|Bohort}}) is the name of two knights in the [[Arthurian legend]], one the father of the other. Bors the Elder is the King of Gaunnes or [[Gaul]] during the early period of [[King Arthur|King Arthur's]] reign, and is the brother of [[King Ban]] of Benoic. The two first appear in the 13th-century [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle. Bors the Younger later becomes one of the best [[Round Table|Knights of the Round Table]], and even achieves the [[Holy Grail]].

==King Bors the Elder==
As Ban's brother, King Bors is [[Lancelot|Lancelot's]] and [[Hector de Maris|Hector de Maris']] uncle. He marries [[Evaine]], the sister of Ban's wife [[Elaine (legend)|Elaine]], and has two sons, Bors the Younger and [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]. Ban and Bors become Arthur's early allies in his fight against eleven rebel kings in [[Great Britain|Britain]], including [[King Lot|Lot]], [[Urien]], and [[Caradoc]], and he vows to help them against their enemy [[Claudas]], who has been threatening their lands. Arthur is late on his promise, however, and Claudas succeeds in his invasion, resulting in both kings' deaths. Ban's son Lancelot is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], but Bors' children are raised in captivity by Claudas' retainers.

==Sir Bors the Younger==
Sir Bors the Younger is better known than King Bors throughout Arthurian studies. Sir Bors and Lionel live for several years at Claudas' court. But they eventually rebel against him and even slay his cruel son Dorin. Before Claudas can retaliate, the boys are rescued by a servant of the Lady of the Lake and are spirited off to be raised with their cousin Lancelot. All three grow to be excellent knights and go to [[Camelot]] to join King Arthur's retinue. Bors is recognizable by a distinctive scar on his forehead, and participates in most of the King's conflicts, including the eventual battle with Claudas that liberates his father's lands. Bors fathers Sir [[Elyan the White]] when the daughter of King Brandegoris tricks him into sleeping with her by way of a magic ring; he later introduces his son into the Round Table.

[[Image:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|right|Bors chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother Lionel]]

Bors is always portrayed as one of the Round Table's finest, but his real glory comes on the [[Grail Quest]], where he proves himself worthy enough to witness the Grail's mysteries alongside [[Galahad]] and [[Percival]]. Several episodes display his virtuous character; in one, a lady approaches Bors vowing to commit suicide unless he sleeps with her. He refuses to break his vow of [[celibacy]]; the lady and her maidens threaten to throw themselves off the castle battlements. As the ladies jump off, they reveal themselves to be demons set on deceiving him by playing to his sense of compassion. In another, Bors faces a dilemma where he must choose between rescuing his brother Lionel, being whipped with thorns by villains in one direction, and saving a young girl who has been abducted by a rogue knight in the other. Bors chooses to help the maiden, but prays for his brother's safety. Lionel escapes his tormentors and tries to murder Bors, and Bors does not defend himself, refusing to raise a weapon against his kinsman. Fellow Knight of the Round Table Sir [[Calogrenant]] and a religious hermit try to intervene, but Lionel slays them both when they get in the way. Before he can kill his brother, however, God strikes him down with an immobilizing column of fire. Bors, Galahad, and Percival go on to achieve the Holy Grail and accompany it to [[Sarras]], a mystical island in the [[Middle East]]. Both Galahad and Percival pass away while there; Bors is the only one to return.

In [[Thomas Malory|Thomas Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Sir Bors agrees to fight as Guinevere's champion when she is accused of poisoning a knight. Bors is reluctant, as her first choice, Lancelot, left Camelot because of Guinevere. He relents when Arthur sees Guinevere kneeling before him.  He is about to joust for her sake when Lancelot arrives to take his place.

Like the rest of his family, Bors joins Lancelot in exile after his affair with [[Guinevere]] is exposed, and helps rescue the Queen from her execution at the stake. Bors becomes one of Lancelot's most trusted advisors in the ensuing war between Lancelot and Arthur, and becomes ruler of Claudas' former lands. When Arthur and [[Gawain]] must return to Britain to fight the evil usurper [[Mordred]], Gawain sends a letter to Lancelot asking for aid. Lancelot's men arrive to put down the remainder of the rebellion led by Mordred's sons [[Sons of Mordred|Melehan and Melou]]; Lionel is killed by Melehan, and Bors avenges his death.

==Modern portrayals==
*In [[T.H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Bors is described as a "misogynist" and an "almost-virgin", and generally something of a curmudgeon.
*In 1975's ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', Sir Bors (played by [[Terry Gilliam]]) is the first Knight of the Round Table to succumb to the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog|Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. Arthur, dismissive of the Rabbit despite Tim the Enchanter's warnings, orders Bors to kill the Rabbit to demonstrate that it is of no threat. However, the Rabbit leaps through the air and onto Sir Bors, and he is quickly decapitated before he can attempt a single blow.
*In 2004's ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', British actor [[Ray Winstone]] plays a different Bors. He is one of the Sarmatian 'knights', and is brash, bold and violent in a departure from the saintly earlier figure. He is brother to [[Dagonet]]; has a native lover Vanora, and more than ten illegitimate children. [[Vanora]] is believed to be an early identity of Guenevere; the Vanora of the film is also some-time mistress to fellow Sarmatian knight Lancelot, who is strongly hinted to be the father of Bors' youngest child, and possibly others (for example Gilly, the eldest), as they have dark hair whereas neither of their parents do.
*In ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'', a Columbia serial from 1949, Sir Bors is played by [[Charles King (character actor)|Charles King]] as a comedy relief sidekick for Galahad.

The word '''character sketch''' means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.

The first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style.   As Pat Rogers notes, [[Henry Fielding]], in book I, chapter 14 of ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'', invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: "Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture." Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.

In later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical.  Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of "Big John" or "the country rube" or "the wise Squire").  Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.

Today, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.

'''Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor''', or '''Charles I of Spain''', was the heir of four of Europe's leading royal houses.  [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] was the first sole [[List of Spanish monarchs|monarch of Spain]], inheriting the kingdoms first united by his maternal grandparents, [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] (the [[Catholic Monarchs]]).  From his father, [[Philip I of Castile]], he inherited the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], which came from his paternal grandmother, [[Mary of Burgundy]].  Finally, on the death of his paternal grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], he inherited the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] lands in [[Austria]].  His [[coat of arms]], representing much of the land he inherited, is [[blazon]]ed as follows:

{{cquote|''[[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]]: I and IV grand-quarterly i and iv great-grand-quarterly 1 and 4 [[gules]] a three towered castle [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] [[Mortar (masonry)|masoned]] [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] and ajouré [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] (for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]), 2 and 3 [[argent]] a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] [[Lion (heraldry)#Positions|rampant]] [[purpure]] crowned Or [[List of heraldic charges#Attitude of animals|langued]] and armed gules (for [[Kingdom of León|Leon]]), ii [[Division of the field|per pale]], dexter [[Division of the field|per fess]], in chief Or four [[Pale (heraldry)|pallets]] gules (for [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]), in base gules a [[cross]], [[saltire]], and [[Ordinary (heraldry)#Subordinaries|orle]] of chains linked together Or and a centre point [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]), sinister party per pale argent a [[Cross|cross potent]] and four crosslets Or  impaling [[Variation of the field|barry]] of eight gules and argent (for [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]), iii per pale, dexter per fess, in chief Or four pallets gules (for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]), in base gules a cross, saltire, and orle of chains linked together Or and a centre point vert (for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]), sinister [[Division of the field|per saltire]], 1 and 4 Or four pallets gules, 2 and 3 argent an [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle displayed]] sable (for [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]); II and III grand-quarterly, i gules a [[fess]] argent (for [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]]), ii azure [[Variation of the field#Semé|semy-de-lis]] Or a [[bordure]] [[Compone|compony]] argent and gules (new [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]]), iii [[Variation of the field|bendy]] of six Or and azure a bordure gules (old [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]]), iv sable a lion rampant Or langued and armed gules (for [[Duke of Brabant|Brabant]]), overall at the fess point of the quarter an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] Or a lion rampant sable armed and langued gules (for [[Counts of Flanders|Flanders]]) [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] argent an eagle displayed gules, armed, beaked, and langued Or (for [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]]); enté en point argent a [[pomegranate]] proper seeded gules, supported, sculpted and slipped vert (for [[Granada]]).''

''[[Supporters]]: A [[Double-headed eagle|bicephalous eagle]] displayed sable imperially crowned proper in front of a saltire ragulée gules, the whole between two columns argent issuing from the sea proper in base, the one to dexter crowned imperially proper, the one to sinister crowned with the [[Spanish Royal Crown|Royal Crown of Spain]] proper.

The first and fourth quarters represents holdings derived from the Spanish crowns:  that is, the quartered arms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|Leon]] themselves quartered with the quartered arms of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Sicily]]. After 1520 the Aragon/Sicily quartering also incorporated the arms of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Kingdom_of_Naples#Aragonese_and_Spanish_Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]], and [[Navarre]].

The second and third quarters represents holdings derived from Charles's Austrian and Burgundian inheritance: these quarters shows further quartering of [[Austria]], [[Duchy of Burgundy]], [[County of Burgundy]], and the [[Duchy of Brabant]], with the escutcheon in the middle showing [[Flanders]] on the left and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] on the right.

The [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Granada]] [[pomegranate]] is represented at the bottom between the two.

==The Burgundian Inheritance and the Order of the Golden Fleece==
In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] had been conquered and annexed by France. In the same year, [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary "the Rich"]], the [[Charles the Bold|last Burgundian duke]]'s only child, had married Charles' grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the Burgundian Inheritance: although the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy itself remained in the hands of France, the Habsburgs remained in control of the title of [[Duke of Burgundy]] and the other parts of the Burgundian inheritance, notably the [[Low Countries]] and the [[County of Burgundy|Free County of Burgundy]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  They often used the term [[Burgundy (disambiguation)|Burgundy]] to refer to it until the late 18th century, when the [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]] were lost to the [[France|French Republic]].  Although Charles V had inherited the grand mastership of numerous orders, the only order which he habitually wore and awarded was that of the Burgundian [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].

'''Edward Estlin''' "'''E.&amp;nbsp;E.'''" '''Cummings''' (October 14, 1894&amp;nbsp;– September 3, 1962), often styled as '''e&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;cummings''', as he is attributed in many of his published works,&lt;ref name="chicago84"/&gt; was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.

Cummings is associated with [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[free verse|free-form poetry]]. Much of his work has original syntax and uses lower case spellings for poetic expression. His use of lower case extended to rendering even the personal pronoun ''I'' as ''i'', as in the phrase "i shall go". Cummings was politically neutral much of his life until the rise of the [[Cold War]] when he became a Republican and a supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]]. He taught briefly at Harvard University in the 1950s, before his death in 1962.

==Life==

===Early years===
Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Leo W. ''This is Our Church''. Boston, Massachusetts: Society of the First Church in Boston, 2005: 104.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings' parents supported his creative gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/cummings/cummings_life.htm|title=E. E. Cummings' Life|website=english.illinois.edu|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on [[Silver Lake (Madison, New Hampshire)|Silver Lake]] in [[Madison, New Hampshire]], where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby [[Joy Farm]] where Cummings had his primary summer residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpkDRPueLiMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=E.E. Cummings: A Biography|first=Christopher|last=Sawyer-Lauçanno|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He expressed [[transcendentalism|transcendental]] leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an [[I and Thou|"I, Thou"]] relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to ''"le bon Dieu"'', as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as "Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen."). Cummings "also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer—not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; &amp; may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/cummings.html |title=E.

Cummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1915 and received a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the university in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Co-Da/Cummings-E-E.html |title=E.

Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/e-e-cummings|title=E. E. Cummings|date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harvard Monthly vol 56.jpg|thumb|right|Masthead from volume 56 of ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]''; Cummings was an editor and contributor to this literary journal while at Harvard]]

===War years===
In 1917, with the First World War ongoing in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps]]. On the boat to France, he met William Slater Brown. They became fast friends. Due to an administrative mix-up, Cummings and Brown were not assigned to an ambulance unit for five weeks, during which time the two of them explored Paris. He fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.&lt;ref name=utexas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00030.xml|title=E. E. Cummings: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman "Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]", in Steven Serafin, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Ferté-Macé|Dépôt de Triage]]'', in [[La Ferté-Macé]], Orne, Normandy.&lt;ref name=utexas/&gt;

They were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, "Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives—''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, p. 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Did F Scott Fitzgerald use upper- or lower-case for Cummings' name?  In a direct quote, it matters. --&gt;

Cummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the [[12th Division (United States)|12th Division]] at [[Camp Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]], until November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/divisions.html#Twelfth|title=Data on U.S. Army Divisions during World War I, WWI, The Great War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war years===
Cummings returned to Paris in 1921 and had lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'' was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"/&gt;

During the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]]. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924–1927).

In 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem "my father moved through dooms of love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title=My father moved through dooms of love |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315070117/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Gary | last = Lane | authorlink =  | year = 1976 | title = I Am: A Study of E.

In the 1930s Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs was Cummings' publisher; he had started the Golden Eagle Press after working as a typographer and publisher.

===Final years===
[[File:EECummingsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of E. E. Cummings]]

In 1952, his alma mater, [[Harvard University]], awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as ''i: six nonlectures''.

Cummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, [[Joy Farm]], in [[Silver Lake, New Hampshire]]. He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962, at the age of 67 in [[North Conway, New Hampshire]] at the Memorial Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/09/04/archives/ee-cummings-dies-of-stroke-poet-stood-for-stylistic-liberty-unusual.html|url-access=subscription|title=E.&amp;nbsp;E.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
[[File:EECummings pd4.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketched self-portrait circa 1920]]
Cummings was married briefly twice, first to Elaine Orr, then to Anne Minnerly Barton. His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a common-law marriage to Marion Morehouse.

Cummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;''Selected Poems,'' Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; After divorcing Thayer, Elaine married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.

Cummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.

In 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a [[common-law marriage]] until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;''Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; while living at 4 [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer-Lauçanno, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
According to his testimony in ''[[Eimi (book)|EIMI]]'', Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931,&lt;ref name=Blumenkranz&gt;Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 "The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism."] Poetry Foundation. www.poetryfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/modern/cummings_ee.html|title=Heath Anthology of American Literature E.E. cummings – Author Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his radical and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] public image, he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and later, an ardent supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wetzsteon, Ross. 'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910–1960', pp. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2DB77ccf9sC&amp;pg=PA449 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Poetry===
Despite Cummings' familiarity with [[avant-garde]] styles (likely affected by the ''[[Calligrammes]]'' of French poet [[Apollinaire]], according to a contemporary observation&lt;ref&gt;Taupin, Rene, ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927'' (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  {{ISBN|0404615791}}&lt;/ref&gt;), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.

While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.

&lt;!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**---&gt;

no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
and whatever a sun will always sing is you

here is the deepest secret nobody knows
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart

i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)
&lt;/poem&gt;

As well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is "frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.

While some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to "paint a picture" with some of his poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Iain | last = Landles | authorlink = Iain Landles | year = 2001 | title = An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings | journal=SPRING, the Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society | volume = 10 | pages = 31–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,&lt;br&gt;
HE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,&lt;br&gt;
FATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
LOVE, YOU DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
ESTLIN.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-233-95637-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.

Some of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right

Women and men (both little and small)

 |source =From "[[anyone lived in a pretty how town]]" (1940)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/11856 "anyone lived in a pretty how town" at the Poetry Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, "they sowed their isn't"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in "in Just"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/images/modeng/public/Cum2Dia/CumDi580.jpg |title=in Just}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features words such as "mud-luscious", "puddle-wonderful", and "eddieandbill." This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled ''Chansons Innocentes'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |title=''Chansons Innocentes'' |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227115128/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |archive-date=December 27, 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has many references comparing the "balloonman" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P. Blackmur]] has commented that this use of language is "frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |title="why must itself up every of a park" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813233241/http://poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |title="anyone lived in a pretty how town" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726121247/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |archive-date=July 26, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.

===Controversy===
Cummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection ''Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems'', Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. ''E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;poem&gt;
:one day a nigger
:caught in his hand
:a little star no bigger
:than not to understand

:i'll never let you go
:until you've made me white"
:so she did and now
:stars shine at night.&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"&gt;Cummings, ''Xaipe, Seventy-one Poems''. New York: Oxford UP, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

and

&lt;poem&gt;
:a kike is the most dangerous
:machine as yet invented
:by even  yankee ingenu
:ity(out of a jew a few
:dead dollars and some twisted laws)
:it comes both prigged and canted&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Cummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Friends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. "America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' &amp; Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'" he said.&lt;ref Name="Reef"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defense.&lt;ref Name="Reef"&gt;''E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-618-56849-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=April 2018}}

===Plays===
During his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''HIM'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are "Him", a playwright, portrayed by [[William Johnstone (actor)|William Johnstone]], and "Me", his girlfriend, portrayed by [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]].

Cummings said of the unorthodox play:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff—relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'—like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. &lt;small&gt;DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.&lt;/small&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three "infrahumans", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "man", in the sense of "mankind".

''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a "synopsis" as well as descriptions of four "episodes", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423191607/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html |date=April 23, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.

===Name and capitalization===
Cummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods ([[full stop]]s), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.&lt;ref name="friedman92"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first =  Norman | year = 1992 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" | journal=Spring | volume = 1 | pages = 114–21 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings "had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer | location = Carbondale | publisher=Southern Illinois University Press | year = 1964 | isbn = 0-8093-0978-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cummings' widow, however, this is incorrect.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; She wrote to Friedman: "You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid &amp; childish statement about Cummings &amp; his signature." On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first = Norman | year = 1995 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" Revisited | journal=Spring | volume = 5 | pages = 41–43 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps2.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Additionally, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'', which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalizion of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes "E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name."&lt;ref name="chicago84"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Chicago University Press|year=2010|title=Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16|section=Captalization of Personal Names|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented "The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed "Twenty Poems" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by [[Teiji Ito]]. It was performed in the round at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in Greenwich Village.

Numerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:
* In 1961, [[Pierre Boulez]] composed "Cummings ist der dichter" from poems by E.E. Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/6957/|title=cummings ist der dichter, Pierre Boulez}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aribert Reimann]] set Cummings to music in "Impression IV" (1961) for soprano and piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2743128|title=Impression IV : nach einem Gedicht von E.E.

* [[Morton Feldman]] (1926-1987) in 1951 composed "4 Songs to e.e. cummings" for soprano, piano and cello, using material from Cummings' "50 poems" of 1940: "!Blac", "Air", "(Sitting In A Tree-)" and "(Moan)".
* The Icelandic singer [[Björk]] used lines from Cummings's poem "I Will Wade Out" for the lyrics of "Sun in My Mouth" on her 2001 album ''[[Vespertine]].'' On her next album, ''[[Medúlla]]'' (2004), Björk used his poem "It May Not Always Be So" as the lyrics for the song "Sonnets/Unrealities XI."
* The American composer [[Eric Whitacre]] wrote a [[Eric Whitacre#SATB choral|cycle of works]] for choir titled ''The City and the Sea'', which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music.
* Others who have composed settings for his poems include [[Dominic Argento]], [[William Bergsma]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[John Cage]], [[Romeo Cascarino]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Serge de Gastyne]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], [[John Woods Duke|John Duke]], [[Margaret Garwood]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Michael Hedges]], [[Richard Hundley]], [[Barbara Kolb]], [[Leonard Lehrman]], [[Robert Manno]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], [[William Mayer (composer)|William Mayer]], [[John Musto]], [[Paul Nordoff]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Peter Schickele]], [[Elie Siegmeister]], [[Aki Takase]], [[Hugo Weisgall]], [[Dan Welcher]], and [[James Yannatos]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/c/cummings/ "E.E.

When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play ''[[Dead End (play|Dead End]]'' into the [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film version]], he recruited the original tough-talking kids from the play ([[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]) to repeat their roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films starring [[The Dead End Kids]]. The most successful of these features were ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938) with [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], and ''[[They Made Me a Criminal]]'' (1939), starring [[John Garfield]]. Universal offered a competing series, under the [[Little Tough Guys]] brand name, later combining the Little Tough Guys cast members with the Dead End Kids (minus Gorcey) as the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys series.

==The East Side Kids==
In 1940 producer [[Sam Katzman]], noting the financial success of other tough-kid series,  made the film ''[[East Side Kids (film)|East Side Kids]]'' using two of the 'Little Tough Guys', Hally Chester and Harris Berger. He added former [[Our Gang]] player [[Donald Haines]], [[Frankie Burke]], radio actor Sam Edwards, and Eddie Brian to round out the new team. The film served as a kind of "pilot" for a possible series of films, which were eventually made possible by this film's success.

Katzman hired former Dead End Kid Bobby Jordan to play the lead in the first film in the series proper, ''[[Boys of the City]]'' and he was soon joined in the series by Leo Gorcey. Gorcey's brother David was also added, as well as (Ernie) [[Ernie Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]] as "Scruno," the only African-American in the group and a former child actor from the very first cast of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team.

In the first few films, [[Dave O'Brien (actor)|Dave O'Brien]] (familiar from low-budget westerns and serials, and as the accident-prone star of the [[Pete Smith Specialties|Pete Smith]] comedies) played Jordan's older brother ''Knuckles Dolan,'' who always seemed to be getting roped into chaperoning the kids from adventure to adventure. O'Brien appeared in different roles as well—continuity between films was often ignored. As with the Little Tough Guys, the membership of the team changed from film to film, until Huntz Hall joined in 1941, when the lineup was somewhat stabilized. In total, 20 actors were members of the team at one time or another.

[[File:Million Dollar Kid (1944) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bobby Stone]], [[Robert Greig]], [[Leo Gorcey]], and [[Huntz Hall]] in the film ''[[Million Dollar Kid]]'' (1944).]]
Always the outsider, Gabriel Dell drifted in and out of the series as a gang-member, a reporter, or a small-time hoodlum (as in ''Million Dollar Kid''). In ''Smart Alecks'' he's an ex-member who left the gang to pursue a life of crime. [[Stanley Clements]] also appeared in ''Smart Alecks'' as well as '''Neath Brooklyn Bridge'' and ''Ghosts on the Loose''. After Gorcey left the subsequent "Bowery Boys" series in 1956, Clements was chosen to replace him in the last seven films.

Monogram (which later became Allied Artists) was notorious for its "[[Poverty Row]]" productions, and the East Side films were no exception. With a minuscule budget of around $33,000 per feature and a tight shooting schedule of only 5–7 days, the series churned out three or four movies a year (an astonishing 21 films in less than six years). There was no time or money for subtlety, story development, or more than one or two takes per scene.

The stories always centered on the tough, pugnacious "Muggs McGinnis" (Gorcey) or the more innocent, clean-cut "Danny" (Bobby Jordan). Huntz Hall's "Glimpy" began as a minor character who grew in prominence as he was allowed to do more comedy bits over the course of the series. The loose format proved flexible enough to shift back and forth between urban drama (''That Gang of Mine''), murder mystery (''Boys of the City''), boxing melodrama (''Bowery Blitzkrieg''), and horror-comedy (''Spooks Run Wild''), with the kids confronting various stock villains: gangsters, smugglers, spies, and crooked gamblers, along the way. The East Side films were problem-teen melodramas until 1943, when director [[William Beaudine]] joined the series and emphasized the comedy content. He encouraged the actors to improvise freely, adding to the films' spontaneous charm.

The contemporaneous events of World War II affected the series as well as the cast.  In 1943 Béla Lugosi (who was in ''Spooks Run Wild'') returned as a Nazi saboteur in the incongruously-titled ''Ghosts on the Loose'' which also featured a young [[Ava Gardner]]; a German-Japanese spy ring was thwarted in the blatantly patriotic ''[[Let's Get Tough!]]'' from 1942 (with Gabriel Dell, of all people, as a Nazi spy). At the end of ''[[Kid Dynamite (film)|Kid Dynamite]]'' Muggs, Danny, and Glimpy enlist and show off their uniforms. In ''Follow The Leader'' (1944), Muggs and Glimpy appear in uniform as they are on leave from the Army. Offscreen, between 1942 and 1944, cast members [[Billy Benedict]], Morrison, Jordan, Dell, and David Gorcey left the series after being drafted. A few days after receiving ''his'' induction notice, Leo Gorcey suffered a near-fatal motorcycle accident and spent almost a year in recovery. His injuries led to a 4-F classification, rendering him unfit for military service.

During Bobby Jordan's absence, his role in the series was taken by former child actor David Durand. Durand had been the star of Columbia's series of "Glove Slingers" campus comedies, and lent the same earnest sincerity to his East Side Kids appearances. (Jordan returned in 1944, in uniform, for a guest appearance in ''Bowery Champs''.)

Starting with ''Clancy Street Boys'' in 1943, Bernard Gorcey (Leo's father) did various bit parts, playing different characters in a total of seven films. In ''Million Dollar Kid'' he and Leo exchanged banter borrowed from an Abbott and Costello routine. He later became a fixture with [[The Bowery Boys]].

Given the low budgets, simplistic stories, and crude, assembly-line production of the East Side Kids series, its enduring popularity relies on the cast's rambunctious energy, breezy banter (often ad-libbed and containing inside jokes), fast-paced action, and Leo Gorcey's trademark [[malapropism|malapropisms]] ("This calls for drastic measurements").

The East Side Kids series was supplanted by [[The Bowery Boys]] in 1946.

The '''flags of the Dutch royal family''' are a set of flags used to identify a member of the royal family. The current system of flags for the Dutch monarch, princes, and princesses was introduced in 1908.

== Background ==
The current system of personal flags for the monarch and other members of the royal family was introduced in 1908. In 1907, minor modifications were introduced to the Dutch coat of arms; likewise, a new flag for the Dutch monarch was introduced the following year. These flags are designed by the High Council of Nobility (who are also responsible for heraldry of the royal family) and are granted by royal decree. Like their coats of arms, these flags are usually shared among siblings.

The flags follow a similar pattern and, although not [[banner of arms|banners of arms]], are heavily influenced by heraldry. Flags of those born into the royal family feature a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field, while the colours are reversed for those who marry into the family. Males have near-square flags while those of females are swallowtailed. Elements of an individual's family coat of arms are also incorporated into the flags.

== Use ==
The flags are used to mark the presence of an individual in certain buildings, when on vehicles (e.g. a car or ship), or in an army unit. The flag of the monarch is flown above [[Huis ten Bosch Palace]] in [[The Hague]] (the king's private residence) and above [[Noordeinde Palace]] in The Hague (the king's official residence) when the monarch is in the Netherlands, but not necessarily when he is actually resident. Besides these two residences, the royal standard is flown above other palaces, castles or estates where and when the King is actually staying.

The flags are never flown at half-mast; during a period of mourning, a black [[pennon]] is affixed to the flagpole flying the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal flags|url=https://www.royal-house.nl/topics/flags/personal-flags|website=www.royal-house.nl|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal standard ==
The '''royal flag''' ({{lang-nl|koninklijke vlag}}), or the '''royal standard''' of the [[Netherlands]], is the official flag of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarch]]. This flag is a non-personal distinctive flag and is not changed from reign to reign. The current flag, introduced in 1908, is a square [[orange (colour)|orange]] flag, divided in four quarters by a nassau-blue [[cross]]. These colours refer to the principality of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]] (in [[France]]) and the principality of [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] (in [[Germany]]) from which the present royal family originates. 

In the centre of the flag is the lesser [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|coat of arms of the Kingdom]] (which originates as a composite of features taken from the arms of the [[house of Nassau]] and the [[Dutch Republic Lion|arms of the Dutch republic]]) surmounted by a [[Crown (headgear)|royal crown]] and surrounded by the insignia of the Grand Cross of the [[Military William Order]]. Each quarter shows a bugle-horn which originates in arms of the principality of Orange.

Image:Arms of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.svg| [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Upon the accession of King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]] in 2013, the monarch's flag was slightly modified: Instead of a rosette, a bow is placed in the ribbon of the Military William Order. Furthermore, the tassels on the horns now both hang down. The adjustments were applied on 30 April 2013 immediately after Willem-Alexander taking office.

==Princes==
The flag of a Dutch prince is rectangular in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princes born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field. 

Instead of the hunting horn of Orange in the upper right and the lower left quarters found in the monarch's flag, these are replaced with figures obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the prince's parent who married into the royal family. 

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed within an orange circle which replaces the center of the cross.

==Princesses==
The flag of a Dutch princess is [[Swallowtail (flag)|swallowtail]]ed in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princesses born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field while the flags of princesses by marriage are reversed. 

Unlike the flags for princes, the right side of the flag is devoid of the hunting horn of Orange and personal figure. However, the left portion of a princesse's flag contains the usual hunting horn of Orange and personal figure (obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the princess's parent who married into the royal family) in the upper and lower left quarters of the flag respectively.

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed either within an orange circle which replaces the center of a blue cross, or at the centre of an orange cross.

==Consorts==
In general, the standard of a prince consort of the Netherlands is a rectangular flag with proportions 5:6 with the colours of the royal standard (i.e. the orange field and blue cross) reversed. The upper left and lower right quarters bear the lion from the Dutch coat of arms (holding arrows in one hand and brandishing a sword on the other) while the other two quarters have a personal figure taken from their personal coat of arms.

In general, the standard of a queen consort, or the wife of a prince of the Netherlands, is a flag in the form of a swallow tail. The two right quarters are empty, the upper left corner bears the orange horn taken from the arms of the Principality of Orange and the lower left quarter has a personal figure, taken from their personal coat of arms.

In both cases, the coat of arms of the kingdom is at the center of the cross.

'''Saint Francisco de Jesus Marto''' (11 June 1908 – 4 April 1919), his sister '''Saint Jacinta de Jesus Marto''' (5 March 1910 – 20 February 1920)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fatima.pt/en/news/today-marks-the-anniversary-of-saint-jacinta-martos-birth Article on Official Webpage: Shrime of Fatima, "Today marks the anniversary of Saint Jacinta Marto's birth."]&lt;/ref&gt; and their cousin [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] (1907&amp;ndash;2005) were children from Aljustrel, a small hamlet near [[Fátima, Portugal]], who witnessed three apparitions of the [[Guardian Angel of Portugal|Angel of Peace]] in 1916 and several [[Marian apparition|apparitions]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] at [[Cova da Iria]] in 1917. The title [[Our Lady of Fátima]] was given to the Virgin Mary as a result, and the [[Sanctuary of Fátima]] became a major centre of world [[Christian pilgrimage]]. The two were solemnly [[Canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Francis]] at the [[Sanctuary of Fátima|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima]], in [[Portugal]] on 13 May 2017, the first centennial of the first Apparition of [[Our Lady of Fátima]].

== Life ==
[[File:Francisco Marto2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Francisco Marto]]
The youngest children of Manuel and Olimpia Marto, Francisco and Jacinta were typical of Portuguese village children of that time. They were illiterate&lt;ref name="Religious Phenomena"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=J. Gordon |last=Melton |year=2008 |title=Fatima (Portugal) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOldV3dVOoUC&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Jacinta%20and%20Francisco%20Marto%20illiterate&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacinta%20and%20Francisco%20Marto%20illiterate&amp;f=false |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena |pages=107–109 |location=[[Canton, Maine]] |publisher=[[Visible Ink Press]] |isbn=1-57859-209-7 |accessdate=15 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but had a rich [[oral tradition]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

According to the memoirs of their cousin [[Sister Lúcia]], Francisco had a placid disposition, was somewhat musically inclined, and liked to be by himself to think. Jacinta was affectionate with a sweet singing voice and a gift for dancing. Following their experiences, their fundamental personalities remained the same. Francisco preferred to pray alone, saying that this would "console Jesus for the sins of the world". Jacinta said she was deeply affected by a terrifying vision of Hell shown to the children at the third apparition, and deeply convinced of the need to save sinners through penance and sacrifice as the Virgin had told the children to do. All three children, but particularly Francisco and Jacinta, practised stringent [[Mortification of the flesh|self-mortification]]s to this end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastorinhos.com/_wp/wp-content/uploads/MemoriasI_en.pdf Sister Lúcia: ''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words'', ''Memoir 2'', p. 94], online, accessed 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation for the Causes of Saints, in the report that confirmed Jacinta as [[Beatification|beatified]], observed that she seemed to have "an insatiable hunger for immolation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/saints/jacinta.htm Congregation for the Causes of Saints Decree regarding the Canonization of the Servant of God Jacinta Marto]. 13 May 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apparitions ==
The brother and sister, who tended to their families’ sheep with their cousin Lúcia in the fields of Fátima, Portugal, are said to have witnessed several apparitions of an angel in 1916. Lúcia later recorded the words of several prayers she said they learned from this angel.&lt;ref name="Religious Phenomena"/&gt;

Sister Lúcia wrote in her memoirs that she and her cousins saw the first apparition of Mary on 13 May 1917. At the time of the apparition, Francisco was 8 years old, and Jacinta was 7.&lt;ref name=nd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faith.nd.edu/s/1210/faith/interior.aspx?sitebuilder=1&amp;pgid=13446&amp;cid=28049&amp;ecid=28049&amp;crid=0&amp;calpgid=10817&amp;calcid=24284|title=Blessed Francisco and Jacinta Marto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first apparition, Mary is said to have asked the three children to say the Rosary and to make sacrifices, offering them for the conversion of sinners.&lt;ref name=cna/&gt; She also asked them to return to that spot on the thirteenth of each month for the next six months.&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/features/saints/saint.aspx?id=1297 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. "Blesseds Jacinta and Francisco Marto", ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illness and death ==
The siblings were victims of the great [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 influenza]] epidemic that swept through Europe that year. In October 1918, Jacinta told Lucia that Mary had appeared to her and promised to take them to heaven soon.&lt;ref name=cna/&gt; Both lingered for many months, insisting on walking to church to make Eucharistic devotions and prostrating themselves to pray for hours, [[proskynesis|kneeling with their heads on the ground]] as they said the angel had instructed them to do.&lt;ref name=nd/&gt;

[[File:Fatima children with rosaries.jpg|thumb|left|220px|From left to right: Jacinta Marto, [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] and Francisco Marto, holding their [[rosary|rosaries]] in 1917]]
Francisco declined hospital treatment on 3 April 1919, and died at home the next day. Jacinta was moved from one hospital to another in an attempt to save her life, which she insisted was futile. She developed purulent [[pleurisy]] and endured an operation in which two of her ribs were removed. Because of the condition of her heart, she could not be fully anesthetized, and suffered terrible pain, which she said would help to convert many sinners. On 19 February 1920, Jacinta asked the hospital [[chaplain]] who heard her [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to bring her [[Holy Communion]] and administer [[Extreme Unction]] because she was going to die "the next night". He told her that her condition was not that serious and that he would return the next day.  The next day Jacinta was dead; she had died, as she had often said she would, alone.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed account of the lives, illnesses and deaths of both children is given in de Marchi, John, ''The True Story of Fatima'', 1950 edition, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/tsfatima.htm entire text on line], found 19 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, shortly before her death at age nine, Jacinta Marto reportedly discussed the [[Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary]] with a then 12-year-old [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you are to say this, don't go and hide. Tell everybody that God grants us graces through the Immaculate Heart of Mary; that people are to ask her for them; and that the Heart of Jesus wants the Immaculate Heart of Mary to be venerated at his side. Tell them also to pray to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for peace, since God entrusted it to her.&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, Leo. ''The children of Fatima: Blessed Francisco &amp; Blessed Jacinta Marto'' 2003 OSV Press {{ISBN|1-931709-57-2}} page 248&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jacinta and Francisco are both buried at the [[Sanctuary of Fátima|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fátima]].&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, Leo. 2003, ''The Children of Fatima'', OSV Press {{ISBN|978-1-931709-57-6}} page 271&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause for the siblings' canonization began in 1946.&lt;ref name="nd"/&gt; Exhumed in 1935, Jacinta's face was found [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]];&lt;ref&gt;"On September 12, 1935, the mortal remains of Jacinta, who died in 1920, were exhumed. Her face was found to be incorrupt." Solimeo, Luiz. ''Fatima: A Message More Urgent Than Ever''. (2008) pg. 97. "Today, the remnants of both Francisco and Jacinta rest at the Basilica of Fátima." pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120309072403/http://www.crc-internet.org/images/jacinta.jpg Jacinta's exhumation photo] at Catholic Counter-Reformation, Page found 13 May 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029034002/http://www.crc-internet.org/images/jacinta.jpg |date=29 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco's had decomposed. By 1951, when she was again exhumed for her reburial in the Basilica, Jacinta had begun to decompose also.&lt;ref&gt;Alipio da Silva Vicente, "[http://ecommons.udayton.edu/imri_photos/138/ Exhumation of Jacinta]". Photograph taken May 1, 1951. Source: University of Dayton Marian Library &amp; Research Institute Photo Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 [[Pope Pius XI]] decided that causes for minors should not be accepted as they could not fully understand [[heroic virtue]] or practice it repeatedly, both of which are essential for canonization. For the next four decades, no sainthood processes for children were pursued. In 1979 the bishop of Leiria-Fátima asked all the world's bishops to write to the Pope, petitioning him to make an exception for Francisco, who had died at age 10, and Jacinta, who had died at age 9. More than 300 bishops sent letters to the Pope, writing that “the children were known, admired and attracted people to the way of sanctity. Favors were received through their intercession.” The bishops also said that the children's canonization was a pastoral necessity for the children and teenagers of the day.&lt;ref name=seyer&gt;[http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/fatima_has_high_hopes_for_francisco_and_jacinta/ Seyer, Loretta G., "Fatima Has High Hopes For Francisco and Jacinta", ''National Catholic Register'', May 16, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] convened a general assembly. Cardinals, bishops, theologians and other experts debated whether it was possible for children to display heroic virtue. Eventually, they decided that, like the very few children who have a genius for music or mathematics, "in some supernatural way, some children could be spiritual prodigies." They were declared venerable by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=seyer/&gt;

On 13 May 2000, they were declared "blessed" in a decree from the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]. Jacinta is the youngest non-martyred child ever to be beatified.&lt;ref name=cna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=153|title=BLESSED FRANCISCO AND JACINTA MARTO :: Catholic News Agency (CNA)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her biography of Jacinta Marto, [[Sister Lúcia]] said that Jacinta had told her of having had many personal visions outside of the Marian visitations; one involved a pope who prayed alone in a room while people outside shouted ugly things and threw rocks through the window. At another time, Jacinta said she saw a pope who had gathered a huge number of people together to pray to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

When Pope John Paul II arrived in Fátima for the first time, in 1982, he said that he had come "because, on this exact date last year in [[St. Peter's Square]], in Rome, there was [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|an attempt on the life of your Pope]], which mysteriously coincided with the anniversary of the first vision at Fátima, that of 13 May 1917. The coincidence of these dates was so great that it seemed to be a special invitation for me to come here."&lt;ref name=seyer/&gt;

Sister Lúcia, when questioned about the [[Third Secret of Fatima|Third Secret]], said that the three of them had been very sad about the suffering of the Pope, and that Jacinta kept saying: ''Coitadinho do Santo Padre, tenho muita pena dos pecadores!'' ("Poor Holy Father, I feel a lot of pity for the sinners!"){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Another miracle was found to have been attributed to their intercession and the process that investigated the presumed miracle was validated on 8 February 2013. On 23 March 2017, it was announced that Pope Francis would canonize them while visiting Portugal on 12 and 13 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/03/23/pope-francis-will-canonize-two-children-who-saw-our-lady-fatima|title=Pope Francis will canonize two of the children who saw Our Lady of Fatima|date=23 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope solemnly canonized the children on 13 May 2017 during the centennial of the first apparition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-Latest-Pope-Francis-prays-at-Fatima-basilica-11143520.php#item-39786|title=The Latest: Pope ends Portugal visit, leaves for Rome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the Catholic Church's youngest saints who did not die as martyrs, with Jacinta the youngest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pope-francis-canonizes-children-behind-three-secrets-fatima-n758531|title=Pope canonizes children behind 'Three Secrets of Fatima'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/world/europe/in-portugal-pope-proclaims-two-fatima-siblings-saints.html|title=In Portugal, Pope Proclaims Two Fátima Siblings Saints|first=Raphael|last=Minder|date=13 May 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2017/pope-recognizes-miracle-attributed-to-fatima-visionaries.cfm|title=Pope recognizes miracle attributed to Fatima visionaries|website=www.catholicnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

'''Gaitelgrima''' is a [[Lombards|Lombard]] feminine name. There are several notable Gaitelgrimas in history.  The identities of these five women (as well as some others of the same name) are often confused because they were all closely related to each other and to two men: [[Guaimar III of Salerno]] and his son, [[Guaimar IV of Salerno|Guaimar IV]]; they were the princes of Salerno from about 983 to 1027 and from 1027 to 1052.

The first was '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''', daughter of [[Atenulf I of Capua]], married [[Guaimar II of Salerno]] and was the mother of [[Gisulf I of Salerno]]. 

The second, also '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''' or '''Gaitelgrima of Benevento''' (died after 1027), was the daughter of [[Pandulf II of Benevento]] and sister of [[Pandulf IV of Capua]].  She was the second wife of Guaimar III and mother of Guaimar IV (his successor), [[Guy, Duke of Sorrento|Guy]] (later duke of [[Sorrento]]), and [[Pandulf of Capaccio|Pandulf]] (later lord of [[Capaccio]]).  She was also the mother of the third Gaitelgrima.  

This third was '''Gaitelgrima of Salerno''', also known as '''Altrude''', who married successively two brothers, [[Drogo of Hauteville]] and [[Humphrey of Hauteville]], who were [[counts of Apulia]].  Through the latter, she was mother to [[Abelard of Hauteville|Abelard]] and [[Herman of Hauteville|Herman]].  

The fourth, also named after Gaitelgrima of Benevento, was also a '''[[Gaitelgrima, daughter of Guaimar IV|Gaitelgrima of Salerno]]'''.  She was the daughter of Guaimar IV of Salerno (see above) and Gemma.  She was married off by her brother [[Gisulf II of Salerno]] to [[Jordan I of Capua]] as was her sister, [[Sichelgaita]], to [[Robert Guiscard]]. 

The last was '''Gaitelgrima, [[Duke of Apulia|Duchess of Apulia]]''', the second wife of [[William II, Duke of Apulia]].  She was the daughter of [[Jordan II of Capua]]. She deeply loved her husband and cut off her hair to cover his coffin at his funeral.

{{Islam}}
The [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], specified ten of his [[Sahabah|companions]] who were promised paradise. Those companions named in this hadith are referred to as '''The Ten With Glad Tidings Of Paradise''' ({{lang-ar|العشرة المبشرون بالجنة}}; ''al-`Asharaa al-Mubasharûn bi-l-Janna'').

==The Hadith==

{{Quote|Narrated [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]]:&lt;br&gt;that the Messenger of Allah said: "[[Abu Bakr]] is in Paradise, '[[Umar]] is in Paradise, '[[Uthman]] is in Paradise, '[[Ali]] is in Paradise, [[Talhah]] is in Paradise, [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Az-Zubair]] is in Paradise, '[[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]] is in Paradise, [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas|Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas]] is in Paradise, [[Sa'id ibn Zayd]] is in Paradise, and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu 'Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah]] is in Paradise."|Collected by [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi]]|''[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/urn/636260|title=Hadith - Chapters on Virtues - Jami` at-Tirmidhi - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|author=|date=|website=sunnah.com|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Muslim view==
[[Muslim]]s put different weight on this hadith, the majority of the [[Sunni]]s, viewing it as very favourable whilst the [[Shia|Shiites]] dismmissed it in its entirety.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
This hadith was narrated in three collections by Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood, and [[Ibn Majah]].

The Sunni collection of hadith, called the ''[[Kutub al-Sittah]]'' (six major hadith collections), includes: ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', ''Sunan Abu Dawood'', ''[[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]]'', ''Jami` at-Tirmidhi'' and ''[[Sunan ibn Majah]]''. ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' and ''Sahih Muslim'' are considered the most reliable of these collections.&lt;ref&gt;Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah, pg. 160 Dar al-Ma’aarif edition; al-Tirmithi, under #3748; al-Tirmithi, Volume 5, Page 605, Hadith 3748; Abu Daoud, #4649 and #4650&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnis say that Muhammad's companions were sorted into twelve groups and of these the ten promised paradise were ranked first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html Twelve Ranks of the Companions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423065308/http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html |date=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Heiling''' (Jan Svatoš in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is a legendary person in [[Germany|German]] and [[Bohemia]]n mythology.

The stories originate from German inhabitants of [[Loket (Sokolov District)|Loket]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]). The son of a water fairy from the river [[Ohře]], who taught him to master magic and command spirits. Once he had become rich and powerful, he ordered the spirits under his command to build a great city. The granite rocks above the Ohře, named [[Hans-Heiling-Felsen]] (Svatošské Skály in Czech), were believed to be the ruins of this city.&lt;ref name="cz"&gt;[http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 COT.cz tourism site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011002443/http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hans Heiling discovered that he could not achieve human happiness even with his supernatural powers, he discarded them and died fighting a bear. Another variant of the story is that the rock formation is a [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] wedding party. A notable [[opera]] of the [[Hans Heiling|same name]] was inspired by the tale.

The poem "Ballad", by [[Gerda Mayer]], is based on the wedding party variant and appears in The Oxford Book of Story Poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Book of Story Poems|year=1990|publisher=OUP|isbn=0 19 276087 4|pages=27–29|editor=Michael Harrison and Christopher Stuart-Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bride-groom-kiss.jpg|thumb|right|A newly [[wedding|wed]] husband kissing his bride]]
A '''husband''' is a [[male]] in a [[marriage|marital relationship]]. The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his [[spouse]] and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between cultures and have varied over time.

In [[monogamy|monogamous]] cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage. This is enforced by legal codes that outlaw two ([[bigamy]]) or more ([[polygamy]]) female spouses. Similarly, [[polyandry]], marriage of one female partner with more than one male partner at the same time is not permitted. In polygamous and polyandrous cultures, there may be more than two parties to a marriage.

In marriages where both spouses are [[Man|men]], both may be referred to as husband.

In [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] marriages, the husband was traditionally regarded as the [[household|head of the household]] and was expected to be the sole provider or [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]], a role that is still maintained in some cultures (sometimes described as [[paternalistic]]).

The term continues to be applied to such a man who has [[Legal separation|separated]] from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a [[widower]]; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the "ex-husband" of his former spouse.

In today's society a husband is not necessarily considered the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the family,{{By whom|date=December 2017}} especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career.  In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.

==Origin and etymology==
The term ''husband'' refers to [[Middle English]] ''huseband'', from [[Old English]] ''hūsbōnda'', from [[Old Norse]] ''hūsbōndi'' (''hūs'', "house" + ''bōndi'', ''būandi'', present participle of ''būa'', "to dwell", so, etymologically, "a householder").

==Related terms==
At the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the [[Social status|status]] of married person and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband.  In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a [[wife]]; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband; between females, each is called a wife. Regardless of gender, a married person is the spouse of the other party to the marriage.

Although "husband" is a close term to [[bridegroom|groom]], the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place.

In some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, he or his family may have received a [[dowry]], or have had to pay a [[bride price]], or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2005, ''dowry''&lt;/ref&gt;  He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as [[dowager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/dower|title=Dower - Definition of dower by Merriam-Webster|work=m-w.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Husband" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar [[husbandry]],&lt;ref&gt;See Wiktionary {{linktext|husbandry}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the "control or judicious use of resources", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its [[profession]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

As an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a [[wedding ring]] on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition.

==Western culture==

===Historical status===
[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]] 
In premodern heterosexual unions ([[ancient Roman]], [[medieval]], and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The  father (as the "[[patron]]") was awarded with much [[authority]], differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_mommsen_1_5_2.htm|title=The History of Rome, by Theodor Mommsen  Book I Chapter 5 Section 2|work=About.com Ancient/Classical History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern]] European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_45/page6.cfm|title=SGN Page 6|author=|date=|website=www.sgn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650–1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a husband in a heterosexual marriage had more opportunities in society than his wife, who was not recognized as legally independent.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary status===
In contemporary [[secularized]] Western culture, the rights of the spouses have been made equal. The [[civil marriage]] generally forces the wealthier spouse "''breadwinner''" to provide [[alimony]] to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also [[Law and divorce around the world]]).

The legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the [[biological father]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

===Islam===
In [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam|various rights and obligations]] that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the [[Qur'an]].

Many Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heba Kotb|Heba G. Kotb MD]], [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm Sexuality in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125251/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm |date=9 July 2011 }}, PhD Thesis, Maimonides University, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is the only major religion that puts a cap on [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]], limiting the number of a man's wives to four—provided the husband can do justice to all of them. Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage.

There is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Marriage in Hinduism}}
A Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home. He is expected to provide for her and to prove his abilities to do so. The marriage in Hinduism is a relationship for Seven births (सात जन्मों का रिश्ता). Before 1951 there was no divorce allowed in Hindu marriage. In past before 1750CE equal rights were given to both men and women and the same was extended in marriage as well.

In modern times once again after 1951, equal rights for women through society and law jurisdiction is given. In Hinduism, based on the different regions, marriage process is observed differently with the same Saat Pheras around agni kund (light pyre) to be taken to become a husband and wife.

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] mentions that "In Hindu law, the male members of a joint family, together with their wives, widows, and children, are entitled to support out of the joint property."&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Economic aspects of family law (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Chinese folk religions===
China's family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People's Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
In Christianity, according to the Bible, a husband in a heterosexual marriage has a number of honors:
* To present his bride to God throughout their lives as perfectly holy and virtuous as can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%253A26-27&amp;version=ESV|title=Ephesians 53A26-27 ESV -  - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To protect his wife with his own life, physically, emotionally and "spiritually".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm|title=Ephesians 5:28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To "lay down" his life, counting her more important than himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm|title=Ephesians 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To lead his wife and his family into the best things for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-29.htm|title=Ephesians 5:29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church--|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To be the best that he can be in God's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm|title=Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To not withhold his body from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm|title=1 Corinthians 7:5 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cultures==
In Japan, before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriages (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expectation of fidelity==
{{Main article|Adultery|Open marriage}}
Although there is generally an expectation for a spouse not to have [[sexual relation]]s with anyone other than his spouse(s), historically, in most cultures, this expectation was not as strong as in the case of wives, a situation which was evident in legal codes which prohibited adultery, with male adultery often being criminalized only if "aggravating" circumstances existed, such as if he brought his mistress in the conjugal home, or if there was public scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=NtitRt1uUXMC |title=Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The double standard was also evident in divorce laws of many countries, such as the UK or Australia, which differentiated between female adultery, which was a ground of adultery by itself, and male adultery, which was a ground only under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/seminars/finlay.html&lt;/ref&gt; This double standard continues to be seen today in many parts of the world. For instance, in the Philippines, a wife can be charged with the crime of a''dultery'' (for merely having one act of sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband), while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of c''oncubinage'', which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|title=Gender Equality in Philippines - Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|work=genderindex.org|access-date=22 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430025115/http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|archive-date=30 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/a-brief-discussion-on-infidelity-concubinage-adultery-and-bigamy/|title=A brief discussion on Infidelity, Concubinage, Adultery and Bigamy|work=Philippine e-Legal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breach of this expectation of [[fidelity]] is commonly referred to as [[adultery]] or [[extramarital sex]]. Historically, adultery has been considered a serious [[offense (law)|offense]], sometimes a crime. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], it may affect the status of children, the [[custody of children]], etc.

'''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was the first recorded [[king]] of [[Arzawa]], in the late 15th century BC. He was defeated by [[Tudhaliya I]] and [[Arnuwanda I]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia'' by Trevor Bryce&lt;/ref&gt; He then attacked Arnuwanda's restive vassal [[Madduwatta]] at [[Zippasla]]. He had a daughter, who married Madduwatta.

Another '''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was born in the 1330s or 1320s BC at [[Mira (Anatolia)|Mira]] in western [[Anatolia]], in one of the princely families. His father joined a coup against king [[Mašḫuiluwa]]. The [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Suppiluliuma I]] married Mašḫuiluwa to his daughter Muwatti and reinstalled him. Kupanta-Kurunta's father apparently died or was exiled soon after. Mašḫuiluwa then asked Suppiluliuma's successor [[Mursili II]] if he could adopt Kupanta-Kurunta as a son.

Mira remained a Hittite ally against [[Uhha-Ziti]] of Arzawa; but two years after [[Mursili's eclipse]] (which would mean 1310 BC) Mira rebelled under influence from "Great-House-Father" (probably an adventurer from Masa). Mursili quashed this rebellion, transferred Mašḫuiluwa to a priesthood in [[Hittites|Hittite]] territory, and installed Kupanta-Kurunta as king.

In the early 13th century BC, [[Muwatalli II]] signed a treaty with Alaksandu of [[Wilusa]]. In it, he informed Alaksandu that he viewed Kupanta-Kurunta as the son of Muwatti and so a member of the Hittite royal family.

Kupanta-Kurunta is possibly the recipient of the [[Milawata letter]].

Kupanta-Kurunta apparently supported [[Hattusili III]] over Hattusili's nephew Urhi-Tessup, "[[Mursili III]]". After Hattusili attained the kingdom, Kupanta-Kurunta received a letter from Pharaoh [[Rameses II]] which was copied to Hattusili. In it, the Pharaoh reassured Kupanta-Kurunta that [[Egypt]] remained a full ally of [[Hittite Empire|Hatti]] and entertained no plans to aid Urhi-Tessup in any further adventures.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East'' by [[Trevor Bryce]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These mythological monarchs supposedly ruled Fib, the reigns of these monarchs are mostly legendary and begin in the 7th century BCE with king Fib. The reigns of these monarchs are attributed to the Pictish chronicles, written in the 10th century during the reign of King Kenneth II of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anthonyadolph.co.uk/the-pictish-king-list/|title=Pictish King List|website=anthonyadolph.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg|thumb|The peasant Joan of Arc (Jeanne D'Arc) led the French army to important victories in the Hundred Years' War. The only direct portrait of Joan of Arc has not survived; this artist's interpretation was painted between AD 1450 and 1500.]]

This is a list of women who engaged in war, found throughout [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], studied in fields such as [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[women's studies]]. A ''mythological'' figure does not always mean a ''fictional'' one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of [[history]] (e.g. the [[Ancient Briton]] queen [[Boudica]], who led the [[Iceni]] into battle against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of [[military]], be it recognized, like an organized [[army]], or unrecognized, like [[revolutionaries]].

==Pirates and seafarers==
*[[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]] sailed alongside [[Calico Jack]], Mary dressing as a man. Anne eventually became Jack's lover, and they had a child. In October 1720, their ship was attacked by a royal fleet. All but one of the male crew members, drunk and afraid, hid below deck as the two women fought on with the help of the unknown man. While imprisoned, Bonny is reported to have said of her doomed lover: "Sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have been hanged like a dog."&lt;ref&gt;^ Druett, Joan (2000). She Captains : Heroines and Hellions of the Sea. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the subject of the 1986 film ''[[Sarraounia (film)|Sarraounia]]'' based on the novel of the same name by Nigerien writer [[Abdoulaye Mamani]].&lt;ref name="alou2009"&gt;Alou, Antoinette Tidjani. (2009). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30131185 "Niger and Sarraounia: One Hundred Years of Forgetting Female Leadership."] ''Research in African Literatures'' 40(1): 42–56 (Spring 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to her post-mortem [[Apotheosis|deification]], the historical Oya was a princess of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] clan as the consort of [[Shango]], its reigning [[king]]. She is often depicted with leopard-like spots, these being either [[wikt:war paint|war paint]] or ritual [[scarification]]. This is done for propaganda purposes, as the [[Leopard]] is famous in Yoruba folklore for its cunning.
*[[Madam Tinubu]] was a powerful titled aristocrat in [[Colonial Nigeria]]. As the first [[Queen mothers  (Africa)#Yoruba tradition|Iyalode]] of [[Egbaland]], she and her private battalion fought against the  [[Dahomey]]ans when they invaded [[Abeokuta]] in the 1850s and the 1860s.

===Nubia/Kush (Sudanese) history===
*The legendary [[Candace of Meroe]] (a title, her real name never given) was a warrior queen in the [[Alexander Romance]] who caused [[Alexander The Great]] himself to retreat upon witnessing the army she'd gathered. This however may be classified a non-historical account because Alexander never reached Sudan.
*[[Amanirenas]], however, was a historical holder of the title of Candace who fought against the Romans after their conquest of Egypt.

*[[Khutulun]] was a 13th-century Mongol princess, the daughter of the Mongol leader [[Kaidu|Qaidu]] Khan and a great-great granddaughter of [[Genghis Khan]]. According to legend she was a skilled warrior and wrestler who vowed that she would only marry a man who could defeat her in wrestling. Although no man was ever able to out-wrestle her, Khutuln ended up marrying a warrior named Abtakul (possibly to squelch rumors about an incestuous relationship between her and her father). Her story was made famous by foreign chroniclers  [[Marco Polo]], and [[Ibn Battuta]], both of whom had heard of Khutuln's legend on their travels through Asia.

===Historical China===
*[[Hua Mulan]] was a (possibly legendary) woman who went to war disguised as a man, and was able to return home after years of war without being found out.
*[[Ng Mui]] was a Shaolin monastery abbess who created a kung fu system especially suitable for women.

*[[Lady of Yue]] was a famous swordswoman
*[[Qin Liangyu]] fought battles with her husband.

Undefeated, she would become one of China and Asia's strongest pirates, and one of world history's most powerful pirates. She was also one of the few pirate captains to retire from piracy.

===Historical Japan===

*[[Marishi-Ten]] the [[goddess]] of [[heaven]], who was adopted by warriors in the 8th century as a protector and [[patron god]]dess. While devotions to Marishi-ten predate [[Zen]], they appear to be geared towards a similar meditative mode in order to enable the warrior to achieve a more heightened spiritual level. He lost interest in the issues of victory or defeat (or life and death), thus transcending to a level where he became so empowered that he was freed from his own grasp on mortality. The end result was that he became a better warrior.
*[[Kaihime]] (presumably born 1572) was said to have fought during the Siege of Odawara and to have personally crushed a rebellion, earning her father the respect of [[Hideyoshi Toyotomi]]. However, historians aren't entirely sure if she truly did accomplish those events.

Freyja is cited as receiving half of the dead lost in battle in her hall [[Sessrúmnir]], whereas [[Odin]] would receive the other half. Some scholars argue that Freyja, [[Frigg]], and [[Gefjun|Gefion]] are [[Avatar]]s of each other. She is also sometimes [[Valkyrie#Connections with Freyja|associated with the Valkyries and disir]].
*[[Shieldmaiden]]s in [[Scandinavian folklore]] were women who did not have the responsibility for raising a family and could take up arms to live like warriors. Many of them figure in [[Norse mythology]]. One of the most famous shieldmaidens is [[Hervor]] and she figures in the cycle of the magic sword [[Tyrfing]].
*The [[Valkyries]] in [[Norse mythology]] are female divine shieldmaidens, who serve [[Odin]]. The name means ''choosers of the slain''.

The two goddesses produce harsh thunderstorms, ferocious squalls, and shoot arrows from their fingertips, each arrow described as killing a man, resulting in the defeat of the Jomvikings.
*[[Brunhild]], in the ''[[Nibelungen]]'', is "a royal maiden who reigned beyond the sea:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 "From sunrise to the sundown no paragon had she.&lt;br /&gt;
 All boundless as her beauty was her strength was peerless too,&lt;br /&gt;
 And evil plight hung o'er the knight who dared her love to woo.&lt;br /&gt;
 For he must try three bouts with her; the whirling spear to fling;&lt;br /&gt;
 To pitch the massive stone; and then to follow with a spring;&lt;br /&gt;
 And should he beat in every feat his wooing well has sped,&lt;br /&gt;
 But he who fails must lose his love, and likewise lose his head."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*In [[The saga of Hrolf Kraki]], [[Skuld (princess)|Skuld]] (not to be confused with the [[Norns|Norn]] of the same name) was a half-elven princess who raised an army of criminals and monsters to take over the throne of her half-brother [[Hrolfr Kraki]], using necromancy to resurrect any fallen soldiers before she personally saw to Kraki's end.
*[[Lagertha]]: Lagertha was, according to legend, a Viking shieldmaiden and ruler from what is now Norway, and the onetime wife of the famous Viking Ragnar Lodbrok. Her tale, as recorded by the chronicler Saxo in the 12th century, may be a reflection of tales about Thorgerd (Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr), a Norse deity.

===Spain===
[[File:Wilkie - defence of saragoça.jpg|thumb|Agustina, maid of Aragon, fires a gun on the French invaders at Saragossa.]]
* [[Agustina de Aragón]] ('Agustina, maid of Aragon', also known as "the Spanish Joan of Arc") was a famous [[Spain|Spanish]] heroine who defended Spain during the [[Spanish War of Independence]], first as a civilian and later as a professional officer in the Spanish Army. She has been the subject of much folklore, mythology, and artwork, including sketches by [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]]. Her most famous feat was at the bloody [[Siege of Saragossa (disambiguation)|sieges of Saragossa]] where, at the moment the Spanish troops abandoned their posts not to fall to nearby French bayonets, she ran forward, loaded a cannon, and lit the fuse, shredding a wave of attackers at point blank range. The sight of a lone woman bravely manning the cannons inspired the fleeing Spanish troops and other volunteers to return and assist her.
* Ana María de Soto, was the first female marine ([[Spanish Navy Marines|infante de Marina]]) in the world. She joined the [[Spanish navy|Armada]] at the age of 16, in 1793, posing as a man, with the name of Antonio Maria de Soto, embarking on the frigate Mercedes. She fought in the battles of Banyuls-sur-Mer, [[Siege of Roses (1794–95)|Roses]], [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Cape St. Vincent]] and [[Assault on Cádiz (1797)|Cádiz]]. She was noticed as a woman during a routine medical recognition, and given the rank and salary of sergeant, in 1798. She was authorized to use the marines' colours and sergeant's chevrons in her woman clothes.
* La Galana ('[[Juana Galán]]') was another woman who fought in the [[Spanish War of Independence]]. She defended Valdepeñas, armed with a baton and aided by the rest of the women in the village because there were not enough men in [[Valdepeñas]] due to the war circumstances. They threw boiling water and oil through the windows. French soldiers were delayed in arriving at the [[Battle of Bailén|Battle of Bailen]] because of this, so Spanish forces won. Also see [[Valdepeñas Uprising]] for more information about this [[guerrilla action]].
* [[La Fraila]] lived in [[Valdepeñas]] as [[Juana Galán]] did. During the [[Spanish War of Independence]] offered food and rest in Valdepeñas' hermitage to the French soldiers. When they were sleeping, La Fraila (which is an alias and her actual name is unknown) closed the doors and set the hermitage on fire using gunpowder as vengeance of her son's death by the French army. She died in the fire as well.

* [[Catalina de Erauso]] or The Nun Lieutenant (La Monja Alférez) was a personality of the Basque Country, Spain and Spanish America in the first half of the 17th century. At the age of fifteen, the age in which Catalina would be required to make her final vows and profess herself a nun, Catalina decided that she was not going to allow her family's traditions or strong religious beliefs guide her life. She ran away from the convent on March 18, 1600. Catalina disguised herself by dressing as a man, and began her journey to the New World. She gave herself the name, "Francisco de Loyola". She participated in several battles. As a prisoner, she confessed her sex to the bishop, Fray Agustín de Carvajal. Induced{{clarify|date=May 2018}} by Fray she entered a convent and her story spread across the ocean. In 1620, the archbishop of Lima called her. In 1624, she arrived in Spain, having changed ship after another fight. On June 29, 1626, Catalina de Erauso was seen by Pope Urban VIII, who granted her a special dispensation that would allow her to continue to wear men's clothing. She wrote her memoirs: Historia de la monja alférez escrita por ella misma.

===Rashidun Caliphate===
[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was the daughter of one of the chiefs of [[Bani Assad]] tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.

[[Nusaybah bint Ka’ab]], also known as [[Umm Ammarah]] (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam. Nusaybah was attending [[the Battle of Uhud]] like other women, and her intention was to bring water to the soldiers, and attend the wounded while her husband and son fought on the side of the Moslems. But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.

===Mesopotamian mythology===
*[[Ishtar]] is the [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n counterpart to the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] [[Inanna]] and to the cognate [[Phoenicia]]n [[goddess]] [[Astarte]]. [[Anunit]], [[Atarsamain]] and [[Esther]] are alternative names for Ishtar. Ishtar is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In the Babylonian pantheon, she "was the divine personification of the planet Venus".&lt;ref&gt;Guirand, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Semiramis]] was a legendary Assyrian empress-regnant who first came to prominence for her bravery in battle and greatly expanded her empire.

===Old Testament===
*[[Deborah]], a prophetess mentioned in the ''[[Book of Judges]]'', was a poet who rendered her judgments beneath a [[palm tree]] between [[Ramah in Benjamin|Ramah]] and [[Bethel]] in the land of [[Benjamin]]. After her victory over Sisera and the Canaanite army, there was peace in the land for forty years.

===Phoenician mythology===
*[[Ashtart]] [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] "ʻštrt" (ʻAshtart); and Hebrew עשתרת (Ashtoreth, singular, or Ashtarot, plural); Greek ([[Astarte]]) is the  Phoenician counterpart to the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] [[Inanna]] and to the cognate Babylonian goddess Ishtar as well as the Greek Aphrodite. She is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war. Ashtoreth is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a foreign, non-Judahite goddess, the principal goddess of the homeland of the Phoenicians which is in modern-day [[Lebanon]], representing the productive power of nature. [[Herodotus]] wrote that the religious community of Aphrodite originated in Phoenicia (modern day Lebanon) and came to Greeks from there. He also wrote about the world's largest temple of Aphrodite, in one of the Phoenician cities.
*Tanit is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling "Tanith", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal ("face of Baal") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).

*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|"the inaccessible"&lt;ref&gt;"Durga." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 25 February  2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363243/Durga"&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}} or "the invincible",&lt;ref&gt;"Durga" Sanatan Society &lt;http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/durga.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bn|দুর্গা}}) is a form of [[Devi]], the supreme [[goddess]] of [[Hinduism]]. According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon. The nine-day holiday dedicated to Durga, ''The [[Durga Puja]],'' is the biggest annual festival in [[Bengal]] and other parts of Eastern India and is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.
*[[Kālī]] ({{lang-sa|काली}}, {{IPA-sa|kɑːliː|IPA}}; {{lang-bn|কালী}}; {{lang-pa|ਕਾਲੀ}};  {{lang-si|කාලි}}; {{lang-te|కాళికాదేవి}}; {{lang-kn|ಕಾಳಿ ಮಾತಾ}}; {{lang-ta|காளி}}), also known as '''{{IAST|Kālikā}}''' ({{lang-sa|कालिका}}, {{lang-bn|কালিকা}}), is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[goddess]] associated with empowerment, [[shakti]]. The name Kali comes from ''kāla'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means "the black one".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In Kāli's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kinsley p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.
* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] ("the killer of demon Chanda and Munda") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] ("Mothers").
*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5012">'''Llŷr''' ({{lang-cy|Llŷr Llediaith}} ({{IPA-cy|ˈɬɨːr ˈɬɛdjaiθ}}); ''Lleddiaith'' meaning "half-speech"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromwich|1961}}, triads #8 and #52&lt;/ref&gt; or "half-language"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a figure in [[Welsh mythology]], probably originally a deity, probably derived from Irish [[Lir|Ler]] ("the Sea"), father of ''[[Manannán mac Lir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}, "Llŷr is often assumed to be borrowed from the Irish Lir, the patronym of the sea-god Manannán&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other than his progeny and odd tidbits, his identity remains obscure.

Llŷr appears as the father of [[Brân the Blessed|Brân]], [[Branwen|Brânwen]] and [[Manawydan]] by [[Penarddun]] in the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Branwen, Daughter of Llyr|''Branwen, Daughter of Llyr'']], the Second Branch of the ''[[Mabinogion|Mabinogi]]''.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Jones|1949}}, New Revised ed. 1993, p. 21, "Bendigeidfran son of Llŷr was crowned king.. His two brothers on the mother's side (Nisien and Efnisien) were sons of Euroswydd by his mother Penarddun."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Welsh Triads]] states that Llŷr was imprisoned by [[Euroswydd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromwich|1961}}, triad #52&lt;/ref&gt; and presumbably, Penarddun consequently married Euroswydd,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mountain|1998}} Celt. Enc. vol. 4, p. 930, "Penarddun then married Euroswydd and bore his children Nissyen and Evnissyen"&lt;/ref&gt; giving birth by Euroswydd to her two younger sons, [[Nisien]] and [[Efnisien]], as stated in the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Branwen, Daughter of Llyr|Second Branch]].&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[King Lear]]'' is based on material taken secondhand (through [[Holinshed]]) from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s mythical king [[Leir of Britain|King Leir]], who has often been connected, but is likely unrelated, to Llŷr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}, "Many trace Shakespear's.. Lear to Llŷr, but the route is tortuous; Shakespeare drew from Holinshed's Chronicles (1577)", etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

(*) Unbordered names are figures not in Llŷr's line of descent, though perhaps members of the extended family.&lt;br&gt; 
(*) This stemma is subject to further elaboration. If the Beli above is to be equated with [[Beli Mawr]] then [[Caswallawn]] stands as Penarddun's sibling. But Bromwich observes that Penarddun should be emended to being the sister of Beli, which would bring consistency with statement elsewhere that Caswallawn and Bran are cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromwich|1961}}, endnotes, p.284- on "Bran Vendigeit m.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10188">[[File:Magnes the shepherd.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Magnes the shepherd from a 19th-century text]]
'''Magnes the shepherd''', sometimes described as '''Magnes the shepherd boy''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Herald|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44791889/|page=23|title=Compasses Invented by Chinese|date=November 6, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mythological figure, possibly based on a real person, who was cited by [[Pliny the Elder]] (23 CE – 79 CE) as discovering [[Natural remanent magnetization|natural magnetism]]. His name, "Magnes", the Latin word for ''[[magnetite]]'', has been attributed as the origin of the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root]] that has passed into English, giving its speakers the words ''[[magnet]]'', ''[[magnetism]]'', the mentioned ore, and related formulations. Other authorities have attributed the word origin to other sources.

As set out in Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' ("Natural History"), an early [[encyclopedia]] published c. 77&amp;nbsp;CE – c. 79&amp;nbsp;CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Anna Marie|title=The Correspondence of Dr. Martin Lister (1639–1712). Volume One: 1662–1677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aByoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|year=2015|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-26332-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as translated from the Latin in [[Robert Jacobus Forbes]]' ''Studies in Ancient Technology'', Pliny wrote the following (attributing the source of his information, in turn, to [[Nicander|Nicander of Colophon]]):&lt;ref name ="Forbes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert Jacobus|title=Studies in Ancient Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA179|volume=IX|year=1964|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, Netherlands|page=179|oclc=180355272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nicander is our authority that it [magnetite ore] was called Magnes from the man who first discovered it on Mount Ida{{Cref2|note 1}} and he is said to have found it when the nails of his shoes and the ferrule of his staff adhered to it, as he was pasturing his herds.&lt;ref name ="Forbes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The passage appears at Book XXXVI of ''Naturalis Historia'', covering "The Natural History of Stones", at chapter 25 entitled "The Magnet: Three Remedies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Elder|translator=John Bostock|translator2=H. T. Riley|title=The Natural History of Pliny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA355|volume=VI|year=1857|publisher=H. G. Bohn|page=355|chapter=The Magnet: Three Remedies|location=London|oclc=615995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pliny's description is often cited, the story of Magnes the shepherd is postulated by physicist Gillian Turner to be much older, dating from approximately 900 BCE.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Gillian|title=North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UfCC0lAtU_0C&amp;pg=PA6|year=2011|publisher=Awa Press|location=Wellington, NZ|isbn=978-1-61519-132-1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any writings Nicander may have made on the subject have since been [[Lost work|lost]].&lt;ref name="Colophon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicander of Colophon|title=Poems and Poetical Fragments|editors=Translated by A.S.F.

Written in approximately 600 CE, book XVI of ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] tells the same story as Pliny, but places Magnes in India.&lt;ref name="Etymologiae"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ep502syZv8C&amp;pg=PA319|date=2006|orig-year=source text c. 600 CE|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45616-6|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is repeated in [[Vincent of Beauvais]]' ''Miroir du Monde'' (c. 1250 CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monthly literary register|title=The Monthly magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2kEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA571|year=1833|publisher=Charles Tilt|location=London|page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Thomas Nicols' 1652 work, ''Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones'', wherein he describes Magnes as a "shepherd of India, who was wont to keep his flocks about those mountains in India, where there was an abundance of [[lodestone]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicols|first=Thomas|title=Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones: With Cautions for the Undeceiving of All Those that Deal with Pretious Stones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udBEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196|year=1652|publisher=Thomas Buck|location=Cambridge|page=196|oclc=12968778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following from Pliny's account, the shepherd's name has been often cited as giving rise to the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] and etymological source of the English word for magnet and the coterie of its related word forms such as ''magnetite'', ''magnet'', ''magnetism'', ''[[magnesium]]'', ''[[manganese]]'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weicker|first=Theodore|title=Merck Report: A Practical Journal of Pharmacy, Materia Medica, and Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkI1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA289|volume=X|year=1901|publisher=Merck &amp; Company|location=New York|page=289|chapter=The Myth of Pliny|oclc=243874912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authorities, including the Roman poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]] ([[circa|c.]] 99&amp;nbsp;BCE – c. 55&amp;nbsp;BCE), have attributed the [[etymology]] of ''magnet'', and progeny, to the name of the [[Lydians|Lydian]] city, [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]] ([[Manisa|Manisa, Turkey]] in modern times), where magnetic ore may have first been discovered or recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deer|first=William Alexander|title=Rock-forming Minerals: Non-silicates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASjwAAAAMAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Longmans|location=London|page=69|oclc=174165277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allom|first1=Thomas|last2=Walsh|first2=Robert |title=Constantinople and the scenery of the seven churches of Asia Minor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh5fAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA8-IA6|year=1839|publisher=Fisher, son, &amp; Co|location=London|page=10|oclc=332119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient locations have been attributed as the origin, including the Greek province Thracian Magnesia, and the [[Ionia]]n city of [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia ad Maeandrum]].&lt;ref name="Senning"&gt;{{cite book|last=Senning|first=Alexander|title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology: The Whys and Whences of Chemical Nomenclature and Terminology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl4sdCYrq3cC&amp;pg=PA240|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-08-048881-3|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the legend of Magnes the shepherd could be the origin of ''magnet'', et al., and the legend itself has been criticized. Pliny's story is characterized in Gillian Turner's book ''North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism'' (2011) as "no doubt embellished by centuries of retelling."&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt; In the 1896 treatise ''Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity'', the authors write: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Magnet' is derived from the legend of Magnes, or from the territory of Magnesia. Pliny states that Magnes, the shepherd, discovered it, and the legend told of him is that while carrying a message over Mount Ida he felt his feet clinging to the earth, to the iron ore which lay thickly upon the hill. Hence the name of the Magnet. But Magnesia was a territory whence this native iron was for hundreds of years exported, and the name "Magnet" is, no doubt, due to this place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frith|first1=Henry|author2=W. Stepney Rawson|title=Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V21YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=1896|publisher=Ward, Lock and Co.|location=London|page=4|oclc=8158356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Muan''', '''Moan''' or '''Mohan''' (moo-ahn), sometimes also known as '''Poira''' is a name applied to several mythological or otherwise supernatural creatures in [[South America|South]] and [[Latin American folklore|Central American folklore]]. The most common and widespread use of the term is to refer to the souls of the dead and the indigenous ancestors of old. The word is also used for [[shaman]]s or [[witch doctor]]s in some [[Colombia]]n indigenous cultures (such as the [[:es:Panche|Panche]]s).
[[File:Mohan pijao.JPG|thumb|right|Un muñeco de Mohán.]]
==History==
Various different legends exist about the Mohan, with many of them emerging from Colombia. In Colombia, Mohan can also mean a forest or barren land kind of supernatural being associated with natural forces such as the great rivers and the mysteries lying within the forests, beyond human reach and comprehension. In some legends, it is a [[satyr]]-like being who steals and rapes young women and lives in a cave-like grotto in the bottom of the great jungle rivers where he keeps his female captives. In others, it is depicted as the spirit of an old Indian, brawny and stout, with a terrifying grin and stare, with larger than human stature and proportions, who steals fishermen's bait, catch or nets, and has the power to change shape into a cat-like beast. Other legends describe the Mohan as a "big-headed Indian, with short legs and fish fins on his back, and very brown."&lt;ref name="Botero 1999 286"&gt;{{cite book|last=Botero|first=Alvaro|title=La fábula y el desastre: estudios críticos sobre la novela colombiana, 1650-1931|year=1999|publisher=Fondo Editorial Universidad EAFIT|location=Medellín|isbn=958-9041-27-2|page=286|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/La_f%C3%A1bula_y_el_desastre.html?id=yqXq2rVoA0kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed as an extremely hairy being with a very treacherous personality who dwells in the backwaters and is feared by many people.

The shaman was not able to fully transform back into a human, and became an alligator with a human head.&lt;ref name="Uribe"/&gt; The Poira, whose name is interchangeable with the Mohan, is described by others as an Indian warlock who lives on the [[:es:Cerro del Pacandé|Cerro del Pacandé]] in Tolima, Colombia.&lt;ref name="Botero 1999 286"/&gt; The Poira is also believed to be a small, naked invisible boy or adult who can also appear formless or as a black bear.&lt;ref name="American Elves: An Encyclopedia of Little People from the Lore of 380 Ethnic Groups of the Western Hemisphere"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth|first=John|title=American Elves: An Encyclopedia of Little People from the Lore of 380 Ethnic Groups of the Western Hemisphere|year=1997|publisher=Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc Pub|isbn=0899509444|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The council of '''Nine Men''' was a citizens board and a form of representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous councils, the [[Twelve Men]] and the [[Eight Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council were elected in 1647, 1649, 1650 and 1652. On July 26, 1649, eleven current and former members of the board signed the ''Petition of the Commonality of New Netherland'', which requested that the States General take action to encourage [[economic freedom]] and force local government like that in the Netherlands, removing the colony from the control of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. It became the basis for the municipal government when the city of [[New Amsterdam]] received its charter in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = About the City Council   | publisher = New York City Council   | date =    | url = http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | accessdate = 2013-01-01   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120620053608/http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | archivedate = 2012-06-20   | df =    }} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2861">The '''Ogoni Nine''' were a group of nine activists from the [[Ogoni]] region of [[Nigeria]] who opposed the operating practices of the Royal Dutch Shell oil corporation. Their members included outspoken author and playwright [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine (Tripathi, p.189), who were executed by [[hanging]] in 1995 by the military dictatorship of General [[Sani Abacha]] and buried in [[Port Harcourt Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="cemetery1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/450161/NIGERIAS-MILITARY-LEADERS-HANG-PLAYWRIGHT-AND-8-OTHER-ACTIVISTS.html?pg=all|title=Nigeria's Military Leaders Hang Playwright And 8 Other Activists|work=Deseretnews.com|publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company|date=1995-11-11 |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The executions provoked international condemnation and led to the increasing treatment of Nigeria as a [[pariah state]] until General Abacha's mysterious death in 1998. Saro-Wiwa had previously been a critic of the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] oil corporation, and had been imprisoned for a year prior to the executions in November 1995.

At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony – in the presence of Shell’s lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiwavshell.org/the-case-against-shell/ The Case Against Shell] &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] sued Shell for its complicity in human rights abuses against the Ogoni people, such as colluding with the Nigerian government to bring about the arrest and execution of the Ogoni Nine. In June 2009, on the eve of trial, the parties agreed to a settlement providing a total of $15.5 million to compensate the plaintiffs, establish a trust for the benefit of the Ogoni people, and cover some of the legal costs and fees associated with the case.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/today-we-remember-the-ogoni-nine-executed-for-struggling-against-shell-in-nigeria/ "Today We Remember the Ogoni Nine, Executed for Struggling Against Shell in Nigeria"], Activist Defense, November 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''posthumous name''' is an honorary name given to royalty, nobles, and sometimes others, in [[East Asia]] after the person's death, and is used almost exclusively instead of one's personal name or other official titles during their life. The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of [[Table of Chinese monarchs|China]], [[List of Korean monarchs|Korea]], [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnam]], and [[emperors of Japan|Japan]].

Posthumous names in China and Vietnam were also given to honor lifetime accomplishments of many people who did not have hereditary titles &amp;ndash; for example, to successful courtiers.

A posthumous name should not be confused with the [[era name]] and [[temple name]].

==Use==
The posthumous name consists of one or more adjectives inserted before the ruler's current title. As rulers from different states might share the same posthumous name, but rulers ''within'' a state would usually not repeat an already used name, the name of the state or domain is usually also given to avoid ambiguity. In Chinese the whole construct is therefore "[state][adjective][title]", which in English is typically translated as "[title][adjective] of [state]", such as [[King Wen of Zhou]], [[Duke Mu of Qin]], and [[King Cheng of Chu]]. The literal meaning of the adjective is normally not translated.

While the names of living Chinese can be just about any combination of characters, the posthumous name was chosen from a rather small pool of stock characters; the literal meaning of which eroded as a result.

== History ==

===Origins===
Early mythological rulers such as [[Emperor Yao]] are considered to have posthumous names.&lt;ref&gt;''Yiwen Leiju'', vols. [[:zh:s:藝文類聚/卷014|014]]&lt;/ref&gt; All rulers of [[Shang Dynasty]] are known only by their posthumous names, as their personal names were not recorded in classical texts.

Archaeological discoveries have shown that early kings of the [[Zhou dynasty]], such as [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], used "posthumous names" during their lifetime, but later they became chosen by successors after the ruler's death. As a result, final rulers of states and rulers seen as illegitimate (such as usurpers) often do not have posthumous names and are referred to by their personal names, e.g. [[Jian, King of Qi]]; [[Min, Marquis of Jin]]; and [[Chen Tuo]].

The use of posthumous names was stopped in the [[Qin Dynasty]], because [[Qin Shi Huang]] proclaimed that it is disrespectful for the descendants, or "later emperors" to judge their elders, or the "prior emperors" (先帝). The practice was revived in the [[Han Dynasty]] after the demise of Qin.

===Decline in use===
Posthumous names are the conventional way of referring to rulers from the Zhou dynasty to the Sui dynasty. In the Zhou dynasty the posthumous name was usually only one character, such as "Wen" (cultured) or "Wu" (martial). However, as time went on rulers began to add more and more characters to the posthumous names of their ancestors. By the time of the [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|first emperor of Tang]] the length had grown to 7 characters, which was taxing to pronounce or write. Therefore, emperors from Tang on are commonly referred to by either their [[temple name]] (Tang through Yuan dynasties) or [[era name]] (Ming and Qing dynasties), both of which are always just two characters long and therefore easy to remember and use.

===Later developments===

Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a blood line apparent. The rule was also followed by non-[[Han Chinese]] rulers of [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], [[Silla]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]], [[Liao dynasty]], [[Vietnam]], [[Western Xia]], [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]. King names of [[Hồng Bàng dynasty]] and [[List of legendary monarchs of Korea#Mahan|Mahan]] also followed the rule but they are thought to be later work.

Some rulers, such as [[Wu Zetian]], or rebel leaders also had similar style [[regnal name]]s when they were alive.

Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give bad posthumous names to the previous monarch. Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs. [[Emperor Aizong of Jin]] and [[Chongzhen Emperor]] had different names from different people. [[Qin Hui (Song dynasty)|Qin Hui]], of the Song dynasty, had a good name, was given a bad one, and had the good name later restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/xhfk/2010-08/11/c_12433570.htm 韩侂胄——《宋史》中的一缕冤魂]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Song dynasty few received bad names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc 從文臣諡號看明清諡法理論，宋秉仁] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152451/http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bad monarchs of the [[Joseon dynasty]] did not receive posthumous names.

Emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing. The [[Guangxu Emperor]], who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name, sports the impressive 21-character title of "Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing of Qing".

[[Puyi]], the last emperor of China, did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967 since he died at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]], when such practices would have been thought feudal.

Use of posthumous names ceased in China with the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (d.1908), in Vietnam with the [[Khải Định|Khải Định Emperor]] (d.1925) and in Korea with the [[Sunjong of Korea|Yunghui Emperor]] (d.1926). However, in Korea unofficial posthumous names were given to [[Crown Prince Euimin]] and [[Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun]].

===Contemporary Japanese use===
Posthumous names are in use to this day in Japan. A deceased emperor is given a posthumous name, which beginning with [[Emperor Meiji]] (d.1912) is identical to his era name and therefore always two characters long. The most recently conferred posthumous name is that of [[Hirohito|Emperor Showa]] (d.1989).

A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous [[Dharma name|Buddhist name]] known as ''kaimyo'', but is in practice still referred to by the living name.

==Guidelines==

===Selection===
Posthumous names can be praises (褒字) or deprecations (貶字). There are more praises than deprecations, so posthumous names are also commonly called ''respectful names'' (尊號 zūn hào) in Chinese. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' outlines extensively the rules behind choosing the names.&lt;ref&gt;明朱睦《易学识遗》辑古谥法十二家，曰《史记谥法解》，曰《周书谥法》，曰《蔡邕独断谥法》，曰《苏洵谥法》，曰《周公谥法》，曰《春秋谥法》，曰《广谥法》，曰《沈约谥法》，曰《贺琛谥法》，曰《扈蒙谥法》，曰《郑樵谥法》，曰《陈思谥法》&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those guidelines:

* Praises
** Those having a persistent and reasonable governance (剛強直理) are called "Martial" (武 wǔ). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who sympathize with the people and recognize their needs (憫民會椅) are called "Civil" (文 wén). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who respect the talented and value righteousness (尊賢貴義) are called "Reverent" (恭 gòng).
** Those who are kind and benevolent in nature (溫柔賢善) are called "Benign" (懿 yì).
** Those who aid the people out of righteousness (由義而濟) are called "Admirable" (景 jǐng).
** Those who treat the people compassionately with a gentle quality (柔質慈民) are called "Compassionate" (惠 huì).
** Those who eliminate destructions and purge cruelty (除殘去虐) are called "Tang" (湯 tāng). Possibly named after the revered ruler [[Cheng Tang]] (成湯), the founder of the [[Shang Dynasty]].
** Those who make the people feel satisfied with their policies (安民立政) are called "Constructive" (成 chéng). Again, possibly named after Cheng Tang.
** Those who are considerate and far-sighted (果慮果遠) are called "Brilliant" (明 míng).
** Those who preach their virtue and righteousness to the people (布德執義) are called "Majestic" (穆 mù).
** Those who are aggressive to expand their realm (辟土服遠) are called "Exploratory" (桓 huán).
** "Highly (respected)" (高 gāo) is particularly reserved for the founders of dynasties.
* Deprecations
** Those who lived short lives without much accomplishment (短折不成) are called "Passed Away Prematurely" (殤 shāng).
** Those who have a constant twinge of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (often due to political plights) during their governance (在國遭憂) are called "Pitiful" (愍 mǐn).
** Those who lose their spouses and pass away at their early age (蚤孤短折) are called "Lamentable" (哀 āi).
** Those who are obliged to make sacrifices to their ancestors (肆行勞祀) are called "Mournful" (悼 dào). 
&lt;!---   ** Those who are () are called "" ( ). --&gt;

However, most of these qualifications are subjective, repetitive, and highly [[stereotypical]]; hence the names are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Such names are usually given by court historians, according to their good deeds or the bad ones.

When combining an emperor's temple name and posthumous name, the temple name is placed first. For example, the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] whose full posthumous name would be "Shi Zu - Zhang Huang Di" (世祖章皇帝), combining the last 2 characters of his temple name and the last 3 of his posthumous name, which is the form most commonly seen in old documents. A fuller description of this naming convention for royalty appears in the [[Chinese sovereign]] entry. The posthumous names of some monarchs and royal members were long, for example [[Hongwu Emperor]], [[Nurhaci]], [[:zh:朝鮮文祖|Crown Prince Hyomyeong]], [[Sunjo of Joseon]] and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].

Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines. Some monarchs of [[Ju (state)|Ju]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Qi (Henan)|Qi]] used place names. Some monarchs of [[Yue (state)]] had Chinese transliterated posthumous names. Some monarchs of [[Goguryeo]], [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] had different style posthumous names. Some early Japan monarchs also had Japanese-style posthumous names (和風諡号).

==China==

===Emperors and empresses===

All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the [[Chinese character|characters]] for "[[emperor of China|emperor]]", ''Huángdì'' (皇帝, i.e. emperor), which can be shortened to ''Dì''; except about a dozen or so less recognized ones who have had only ''Dì'' and no ''Huáng''.

Starting with Emperor [[Emperor Wen of Han|Xiaowen of Han]] (more commonly "Emperor Wen"), every single Han emperor, except the first one of the Eastern Han Dynasty, has the character of "[[filial piety|filial]]" (孝 xiào) at the beginning of his posthumous names. "Filial" is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties. For Qing emperors, 孝 xiào is placed in various position in the string of characters, while those Qing empresses who were given posthumous names, 孝 xiào is always initial.

The number of characters in posthumous names was increasing. The emperors of the [[Tang Dynasty]] have names in between seven and eighteen characters. Those in the [[Qing Dynasty]] have twenty-one characters. For instance, that of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was "The Emperor of Order who Observes the Heavenly Rituals with a Solemn Fate, Destined to Unify, Establishes with Extreme Talented Insights, Admires the Arts, Manifests the Might, with Great Virtue and Vast Achievement, Reaches Humanity, Purely Filial" (體天隆運定統建極英睿欽文顯武大德弘功至仁純孝章皇帝,  {{Audio|Chinese-Emperor Shunzhi posthumous name.ogg|Listen to pronunciation}}: tǐ tiān lóng yùn dìng tǒng jiàn jí yīng ruì qīn wén xiǎn wǔ dà dé hóng gōng zhì rén chún xiào zhāng huáng dì).

The woman with the longest posthumous name is [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who is "The Empress who is Admirably Filial, Initiates Kindness, with Blessed Health, Manifests Much Contentment, Solemn Sincerity, with Longevity, Provides Admiration Prosperously, Reveal Adoration, Prosperous with a Merry Heaven, with a Holy Appearance" (孝欽慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙配天興聖顯皇后 xiào qīn cí xǐ duān yòu kāng yí zhāo yù zhuāng chéng shòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī pèi tiān xīng shèng xiǎn huáng hòu), or 孝欽顯皇后 for short.

===Imperial family===

According to the noble system since the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the immediate family members of the Emperor were given the titles of Kings (or Princes), Dukes, Earls, etc., with or without actual control over a region of land. After their death, they would be referred to by the same title, with the posthumous name (usually one character) inserted in the middle. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. For example, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] was posthumously named Zhong (忠), and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong (恭忠親王 Gongzhong qīnwáng); [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]] was posthumous named Xian (賢), hence is referred Prince Chunxian (醇賢親王 Chunxian qīnwáng).

===Officials===
It was also common for persons with no hereditary titles, especially accomplished scholar-officials or ministers, to be given posthumous names by the imperial court. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. The length, however, was restricted to one or two characters. The posthumous name is sometimes rendered [[canonization]] in English, for the scholar-official to Confucianism is analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church, though the process is not nearly as long. See [[List of Posthumous Names]] for some examples.

[[Confucius]] has been given long posthumous names in almost every major dynasty. One of the most commonly used was Zhìshèngxiānshī 至聖先師.

Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court, but by his own family or disciples. Such names are private posthumous names (Sĩshì, 私諡). For example, [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] was given ''Sishi'' Jìngjié 靖節.

==Korea==
In [[Korea]], [[Goguryeo]] kings were mostly given posthumous names after their burial places, or in case of [[Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto]], the name described his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3006407|title=Of tombs and posthumous names|date=2015-07-09|accessdate=2016-06-03|publisher=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Silla]], every monarchs were given the titles of ''wang'' (왕, "king") with two characters in posthumous names from [[Jijeung of Silla]]. On the other hand, all posthumous names for kings of [[Balhae]] were restricted to one character.

Most of the kings of [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] were called [[temple name]] more than posthumous name unlike dynasties of ancient Korea. This is a longer name, made up of adjectives characteristic of the king's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/common/printpreview.asp?categoryCode=628&amp;newsIdx=153615|title=Rediscovering aesthetics of Jongmyo Shrine |publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/korea/01_notes.php|title=Korea: Notes|publisher=archontology.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000927530|title=조선시대 국왕호칭의 종류와 의미  The Kinds and Meaning of King's Name in the Chosun Dynasty|publisher=NRF|journal=역사와경계 |year=2004|issue=52|pages=46–67|language=English, Korean|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s posthumous name was Hongdoseon Yeolpyeongse Sukheonui Hyoganghye Daeseong Daewang (홍도선열평세숙헌의효강혜대성대왕), while his temple name was Gwangjong. Details of the system of posthumous name were made during the Joseon Dynasty. During the Joseon Dynasty, After five days the king's funeral, officials discussed and decided the king's posthumous name. The Ministry of Culture and Education (예조, 禮曹) was in charge of the naming. Also, Shorn of his power, the deposed king has not been given any posthumous names with temple name unless reinstated. They were degraded to the rank of ''gun'' (군, "prince"). [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsan-gun]] and [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghae-gun]] were are notable examples.

[[Crown Prince Hyomyeong]] has been given longest posthumous names in Korea. He were posthumously elevated in status and given the title Emperor Munjo with with 113 characters in posthumous names in 1899.

==Japan==
In Japan, posthumous names are called ''shigō'' (諡号), ''okuri-na'' (諡), or ''tsuigo'' (追号). Those of Japanese emperors are also sometimes called ''teigō'' (帝号, "emperor name[s]").

There are two styles in emperors' posthumous names, namely Chinese style and Japanese style. In addition to the appellation ''Tennō'' (天皇, "heavenly sovereign", usually translated as ''Emperor'') that is a part of all Japanese emperors' posthumous name, most of them consist of two [[kanji]] characters, although a few consist of three. Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for [[Emperor Jimmu]] and [[Emperor Antoku]], for example. Others are given immediately after death, like that of [[Emperor Monmu]].

Many have Chinese-style names, for example:
* [[Emperor Jimmu]] (神武天皇 ''Jinmu Tennō'', lit. ''Divine Might'')
* [[Emperor Nintoku]] (仁徳天皇 ''Nintoku Tennō'', lit. ''Humane  Virtue'')
* [[Emperor Ōjin]] (応神天皇 ''Ōjin Tennō'', lit. ''Answering the Gods'')

Some have Japanese-style names. For example:
* those who were named after the place where the emperor was born, lived or frequented:
** [[Emperor Saga]] (嵯峨天皇 ''Saga Tennō''), named after a [[palace]] (院 ''in'')
** [[Emperor Ichijo|Emperor Ichijō]] (一条天皇 ''Ichijō Tennō''), named after an official residence (邸 ''tei'')
** [[Emperor Kōmyō]] (光明天皇 ''Kōmyō Tennō''), named after a [[temple]]
** [[Emperor Higashiyama]] (東山天皇 ''Higashiyama Tennō''), named after a [[hill]]
* those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding ''Go'' (後, lit. ''latter'') as a prefix to the earlier emperor's name:
** [[Emperor Go-Ichijo|Emperor Go-Ichijō]]  (後一条天皇 ''Go-Ichijō Tennō'')
** [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (後醍醐天皇 ''Go-Daigo Tennō'')
** [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] (後桜町天皇 ''Go-Sakuramachi Tennō'')
* those who were named by combining the characters from two previous emperors' names:
** [[Empress Genmei|Empress Gen'''mei''']] (元明天皇 ''Genmei Tennō'') + [[Empress Genshō|Empress Gen'''shō''']] (元正天皇 ''Genshō Tennō'') = [[Empress Meishō|Empress '''Meishō''']] (明正天皇 ''Meishō Tennō'')
** [[Empress Kōken|Empress '''Shō'''toku]] (称徳天皇 ''Shōtoku Tennō'') + [[Emperor Kōnin|Emperor '''Kō'''nin]] (光仁天皇 ''Kōnin Tennō'') = [[Emperor Shōkō|Emperor '''Shōkō''']] (称光天皇 ''Shōkō Tennō'')

Since the death of [[Emperor Meiji]] (明治天皇 ''Meiji Tennō'') in 1912, the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the name of his [[Japanese era name|era]].  For example, after his death, [[Hirohito]] (by which he is usually called outside Japan) was formally renamed '''Emperor Shōwa''' (昭和天皇 ''Shōwa Tennō'') after [[Shōwa period|his era]]; Japanese now refer to him by only that name. ''Hirohito'' was his given name; most Japanese never refer to their emperors by their given names, [[Naming taboo#In other countries|as it is considered disrespectful]].

A '''regnal name''', or '''reign name''', is the name used by [[monarch]]s and [[pope]]s during their [[reign]]s and, subsequently, historically. Since ancient times, some monarchs have chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. 
 
The regnal name is usually followed by a [[regnal number]], written as a [[Roman numeral]], to differentiate that monarch from others who have used the same name while ruling the same realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]], [[George Tupou V]] of [[Tonga]]. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name. For example, the same person was both [[James VI and I|King James I of England and King James VI of Scotland]].

The ordinal is not normally used for the first ruler of the name, but is used in historical references once the name is used again. Thus, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] of England was called simply "Elizabeth of England" until the accession of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] almost four centuries later in 1952; subsequent historical references to the earlier queen retroactively refer to her as Elizabeth I. However, [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar Paul I of Russia]], [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I of Italy]], [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]], and [[Pope John Paul I]] all used the ordinal I (first) during their reigns, while [[Pope Francis]] does not. In spoken English, such names are pronounced as "Elizabeth the First", "George the Sixth" etc.

In some countries in Asia, monarchs took or take [[Chinese era name|era names]]. While era names as such are not used in many monarchies, sometimes eras are named after a monarch (usually long-lived), or a succession of monarchs of the same name. This is customary; there is no formal or general rule. The whole period during which a succession of four Georges ([[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|II]], [[George III of Great Britain|III]], and [[George IV of Great Britain|IV]]) of the Hanoverian dynasty reigned in Great Britain became known as the [[Georgian era]]; although there were many Edwards, the [[Edwardian era]] always refers to the reign of [[Edward VII]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Monarchies==

===Ancient rulers===
{{Further|Throne name (Ancient Egypt)}}
Ancient rulers in many parts of the world took regnal names or throne names which were different from their personal name.  This is known to be true, for instance, of several kings of [[Assyria]], and appears to be the case for several Kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].  In [[Ancient Egypt]], Pharaohs took a number of names - the ''[[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary#(Throne name (praenomen)|praenomen]]'' being the most commonly used, on occasion in conjunction with their personal name.

=== Africa ===
==== Ethiopia ====
In the [[Ethiopian Empire]], especially during the [[Solomonic dynasty]], many [[List of Emperors of Ethiopia|Emperors]] would take a throne name, though this was not a general practice; a great number of rulers would remain known during their reign by their birth names. [[Yekuno Amlak of Ethiopia|Yekuno Amlak]], the founder of the Solomonic dynasty, took his father's name, Tasfa Iyasus, as his throne name. [[Yagbe'u Seyon of Ethiopia|Yagbe'u Seyon]], his son and heir, took the throne name [[Solomon|Salomon]] after the biblical figure. [[Amda Seyon I of Ethiopia|Amda Seyon]] took the throne name Gebre Mesqel, "slave of the [[Christian cross|cross]]"; [[Tewodros I of Ethiopia|Tewodros I]] was Walda Ambasa, "son of the lion"; [[Sarwe Iyasus]] was Mehreka Nañ "distributor of your [the [[Names of God|Lord]]'s] mercy"; etc. Tafari Makonnen, the last sovereign Emperor of Ethiopia, took as his throne name [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], meaning "Power of the [[Trinity]]".

==== Nigeria ====
In the various extant [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]], the regnal names of the titled monarchs, who are known locally as the [[Nigerian traditional rulers|traditional rulers]], serve two very important functions within the monarchical system. Firstly, seeing as how most states are organised in such a way as to mean that ''all'' of the legitimate descendants of the first man or woman to arrive at the site of any given community are considered its dynastic [[heir]]s, their thrones are usually rotated amongst almost endless pools of contending cousins who all share the names of the founders of their houses as primary surnames. In order to tell them all apart from one another, secondary surnames are also used for the [[sept]]s of each of the royal families that are eligible for the aforementioned rotations, names that often come from the names of state of the first members of their immediate lineages to rule in their lands. Whenever any of their direct heirs ascend the thrones, they often use their septs' names as reign names as well, using the appropriate ordinals to differentiate themselves from  the founders of the said septs. An example of this is found in the kingdom of [[Lagos]], where the Adeniji-Adele family is distinguished from their numerous Adele cousins by the word ''Adeniji'', which was actually the first name of the reigning founder of their branch of the dynasty, the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] [[Adeniji Adele|Adeniji Adele II]]. This distinction notwithstanding, both groups of [[dynast]]s (as well as a number of other ones that don't have the name Adele as an official surname, such as that of the Oloye Adekunle Ojora, a prominent nobleman of royal descent) are part of what is known as the Adele Ajosun Ruling House of Lagos.

Beyond that which is described above, regnal names also serve in Nigeria and indeed in much of Africa as chronological markers in much the same way that those of Europe do (e.g. the ''Victorian'' era). Whenever one hears of a person describing what happened at the time when so and so ruled over any particular place or people, what he or she is actually saying is that an event happened within a finite period of time, one that is equal to the duration of the reign of the monarch in question. Now seeing as how it is possible (and in fact common, particularly among the southern tribes) for one individual to have several different names and aliases in a single life, a certain degree of uniformity in usage is required if the history of an entire state is to be tied to his or her name. It is for this reason that when new monarchs are enthroned, the uniqueness of their names is usually considered to be a matter of considerable importance (even when it is caused by nothing more than the adding of ordinals to them or the allowing of more than a generation to pass before their  subsequent usage). An example of this can be found in the [[kingdom of Benin]], where the throne name of [[Erediauwa I]] became the surname of all of his immediate family in the Eweka royal house of the state, thus nominally tying them and their descendants to the era of his reign. This is especially obvious when their branch's name is compared to the last names of the said king's brothers and their heirs, named the Akenzuas after his father [[Akenzua II]], and his uncles and their heirs, named the Ewekas after his grandfather [[Eweka II]].

In the case of the comparatively small number of Nigerian monarchs, such as Obi [[Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe|Nnaemeka Achebe]] of [[Onitsha]], who do not make use of regnal names as a result of a variety of reasons, pre-coronation names are maintained during their reigns.

===Asia===
In parts of east Asia, it is more a rule than an exception that monarchs take additional names when ascending, and quite often discard the name they were known by as princes. Often the assumed name is different from the childhood name, and a new [[temple name]] could be assumed. A [[posthumous name]] is sometimes accorded to a deceased monarch. Rebel leaders may also take regnal names. The regnal names of some monarchs were long, for example [[Lý Thái Tổ]], [[Jiajing Emperor|Emperor Shizong of Ming]] and [[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire]]. While many rulers in east Asia (including in China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan) took regnal names based on [[Chinese characters]], some monarchs of [[Xu (state)|Xu]], [[Xiongnu]], [[Tuyuhun Kingdom]], [[Rouran Khaganate]], [[Göktürks]], [[Uyghur Khaganate]] and [[List of Mongol Khans|Mongol]] took Chinese transliterated non-Chinese regnal names. For details on the multiple names assumed by individual East Asian monarchs, see:
* [[Chinese era name]]
* [[Japanese era name]]

* [[List of Monarchs of Korea]]
* [[List of Mongolian monarchs]]
* [[List of Vietnamese monarchs]]
* [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)]]
* [[List of sovereign state leaders in the Philippines|List of Rulers in the Philippines]]
Some [[royal family]] members may receive honorary names such as [[:zh:徽号|Huihao]] and [[:ja:宮号|Miyagō]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc.matsuyama-u.ac.jp/~tamura/itijikinn.pdf 紀宮は、宮号（みやごう＝皇族に天皇がおくる称号）]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Hungary====
During the Medieval Age, when the [[House of Árpád]] disappeared in 1301, two of the monarchs that claimed the throne and were crowned chose a different name. [[Otto III, Duke of Bavaria]] became Bela V of Hungary, taking the name of his maternal grandfather, [[Béla IV of Hungary]]. In the other hand, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia]] signed his royal documents in Hungary as Ladislas, this being a very traditional name in the Kingdom.

Later during the first half of the 14th century, [[Charles I of Hungary]] signed as "''Carolus rex''", but in fact his birth name was the Italian ''Caroberto''. This is why he is often referred to by the Hungarian historians as "Charles Robert of Hungary".

====Netherlands====
All ruling male members of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] bore the name [[Willem]] (William). The current king of the Netherlands was christened [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]. During an interview in 1997 he said he intended to rule under the name of Willem IV, but he had a change of mind. In a televised interview just before his inauguration, he announced he would continue to use the name Willem-Alexander, saying "I spent 46 years of my life under the name Willem-Alexander, and specifically under the nickname of Alexander. I think it would be weird to discard that because I become king of the country." Furthermore, he said he did not consider himself "a mere number", adding that regnal numbers reminded him of Dutch cattle naming conventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://nos.nl/koningshuis/video/496848-willem-4-staat-bij-bertha-38-in-de-wei.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
When the [[House of Piast]] disappeared and the [[Lithuania]]n [[House of Jagiellon]] was elected in the figure of the High Duke [[Jogaila]], this monarch took the name of Władysław II, in honour of the previous Polish king ([[Władysław I the Elbow-high]]) with this traditional name. Similarly, when the Elector of Saxony, Frederick Augustus I, was elected king in 1697, he took the name of Augustus II. His son Frederick Augustus II crowned in 1734, also took the name of Augustus, becoming Augustus III.

====Portugal====
The [[List of Portuguese monarchs|monarchs of Portugal]] have traditionally used their first baptismal name as their regnal name upon their accession. The only notable exception was [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], who was born Martin of Burgundy (''Martinho de Borgonha'', in Portuguese). As he was not the heir to the throne, Martin was expected to join the clergy, and was named after [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin of Tours]], on whose feast day he had been born. When the [[heir apparent]], Henry, died, the prince's name was changed to Sancho, one with a more established royal tradition in the other Iberian monarchies (Navarre, Castile and Aragon).

====United Kingdom====
Though most [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchs of the United Kingdom]] have used their first baptismal name as their regnal name, on three occasions monarchs have chosen a different name.

First, [[Queen Victoria]] had been christened Alexandrina Victoria, but took the throne under the name Victoria.

When Victoria's son, Prince Albert Edward, became king in 1901, he took the regnal name [[Edward VII]], against the wish of his late mother.&lt;ref name="Regnal Names"&gt;{{cite book |last=Panton |first=Kenneth |date= |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BiyyueBTpaMC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392&amp;dq=Prince+Albert+Edward,+became+king+in+1901,+he+took+the+regnal+name+%5B%5BEdward+VII%5D%5D,+against+the+wish+of+his+late+mother&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bjK3UziERz&amp;sig=q8hJv92WqVVppR4SZvLTfleoHQY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUwdPAoe_OAhXEoJQKHb9RA1wQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Prince%20Albert%20Edward%2C%20became%20king%20in%201901%2C%20he%20took%20the%20regnal%20name%20%5B%5BEdward%20VII%5D%5D%2C%20against%20the%20wish%20of%20his%20late%20mother&amp;f=false |location=US |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=392 |isbn=978-0810857797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new king declared that he chose the name Edward alone as an honoured name borne by six of his predecessors, and that he did not wish to diminish the status of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|his father]], with whom alone among royalty the name Albert should be associated.

In 1936, after the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]], Prince Albert, Duke of York, assumed the throne as [[George VI|King George VI]] rather than "King Albert". His full name was Albert Frederick Arthur George; like Edward VII and Victoria he used another of his names.

There has been speculation that the current [[heir apparent]] to the British throne, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], may elect not to be known as "Charles III" out of concern about comparisons with [[Charles II of England]] (who was known for his Catholic sympathies), [[Charles I of England]] (who was executed after the [[English Civil War]]) and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] memory of the "Young Pretender" [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (who claimed the title "Charles III").&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article782407.ece|work=The Times |location=UK | title=Call me George, suggests Charles | date=24 December 2005| accessdate=13 July 2009 | first=Andrew | last=Pierce}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may instead choose to be known as George VII in honour of his grandfather.&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge" /&gt; However, the Prince has not as yet announced any decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/27/monarchy.michaelwhite|work=The Guardian |location=UK | title=Charles denies planning to reign as King George | date=27 December 2005| accessdate=2 October 2012 | first=Michael | last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; His full name is Charles Philip Arthur George.

====Scotland====
When [[Robert III of Scotland|John, Earl of Carrick]] ascended the Scottish throne in 1390, it was deemed imprudent for him to take the regnal name of "John II", as recent kings named John had turned out badly: [[John of England|in England]] as well as [[John Balliol|in Scotland]]. Furthermore, royal propaganda of the time held that John Balliol had not been a legitimate king of Scotland, making the new king's [[regnal number]] also a tricky issue. To avoid these problems, John took the regnal name of ''Robert III'', honouring [[Robert II of Scotland|his father]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|great-grandfather]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Magnus, ''Scotland: The Story of a Nation'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the accession, in 1952, of [[Elizabeth II]] the title ''Elizabeth II'' caused controversy in Scotland as there had never been a Scottish ''Elizabeth I''. The Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] informed the [[British House of Commons]] that the practice since the Union was to use the higher numeral. New [[Royal Mail]] post boxes in Scotland, bearing the [[Royal Cypher|cypher]] ''E&lt;small&gt;II&lt;/small&gt;R'', were vandalised, after which, to avoid further problems, post boxes and Royal Mail vehicles in Scotland bore only the [[Crown of Scotland]]. A legal case, ''[[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]]'' (1953 SC 396), contested the right of the Queen to title herself ''Elizabeth II'' in Scotland, arguing that to do so would be a breach of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]]. The case, however, was lost on the grounds that the pursuers had no title to sue the Crown, and also that the numbering of monarchs was part of the [[royal prerogative]], and thus not governed by the Act of Union.

====The Roman Empire====
The Roman Emperors usually had the titles of Imperator Caesar Augustus in their names. (which made their regnal names) Caesar came from the cognomen of Gaius Julius Caesar, Imperator meant Commander and Augustus meant venerable or majestic. The name usually went in two ways, Imperator (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Caesar Augustus or Imperator Caesar (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Augustus. Also Imperator became a Praenomen of Roman Emperors, Augustus and Caesar became a cognomen of theirs.

==Religious offices==

===Catholic Church===
{{Main|Papal name}}
Immediately after a new pope is elected, and accepts the election, he is asked by the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], "By what name shall you be called?" The new pope chooses the name by which he will be known. The senior Cardinal Deacon, or [[Cardinal Protodeacon]], then appears on the balcony of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] to proclaim the new Pope, informing the world of the man elected Pope, and under which name he would be known during his reign.

&lt;blockquote lang="la" style="font-style:italic; width:42%; margin:1em 4%; float:left;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum:
[[Habemus Papam]],
Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum,
Dominum [forename],
Sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ Cardinalem [surname],
qui sibi nomen imposuit [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:42%; margin:1em 4%; float:left;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I announce to you a great joy:
We have a Pope,
The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord,
Lord [forename],
Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church [surname],
who conferred upon himself the name [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the first centuries of the church, priests elected [[bishop of Rome]] continued to use their baptismal names after their elections. The custom of choosing a new name began in AD 533 with the election of [[Pope John II|Mercurius]]. Mercurius had been named after the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and decided that it would not be appropriate for a pope to be named after a Roman god. Mercurius subsequently decreed that he would be known as John II. Since the end of the tenth century the pope has customarily chosen a new name for himself during his Pontificate; however, until the 16th century some pontiffs used their [[Given name|baptismal names]].

The last pope to use his baptismal name was [[Pope Marcellus II]] in 1555, a choice that was even then quite exceptional. The names chosen by popes are not based on any system other than general honorifics. They have been based on immediate predecessors, mentors, political similarity, or even after family members—as was the case with [[Pope John XXIII]]. The practice of using the baptismal name as papal name has not been ruled out and future popes could elect to continue using their original names after being elected pope.

Often the new pontiff's choice of name upon being elected to the papacy is seen as a signal to the world of whom the new pope will emulate or what policies he will seek to enact. Such is the case with [[Benedict XVI]] who, in fact, explained the [[Pope Benedict XVI#Choice of name|reasons for his choice of name]] during his first General Audience in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005. On that occasion, he said that he wanted to remember "[[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war," and also "[[Saint Benedict of Nursia]], co-patron of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe."

There has never been a [[Pope Peter II]]. Even though there is no specific prohibition against choosing the name Peter, bishops elected to the Papacy have refrained from doing so even if their own given name was Peter. This is because of a tradition that only [[Saint Peter]] should have that honor. In the 10th century [[Pope John XIV|John XIV]] used the regnal name ''John'' because his given name was Peter. While some [[antipope]]s did take the name Peter II, their claims are not recognized by the mainstream Roman Catholic Church, and each of these men only either has or had a minuscule following that recognized their claims.

Probably because of the controversial [[Antipope John XXIII]], new popes avoided taking the regnal name John for over 600 years until the election of [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Cardinal Roncalli]] in 1958. Immediately after his election, there was some confusion as to whether he would be known as John XXIII or John XXIV. Cardinal Roncalli thus moved to immediately resolve by declaring that he would be known as John XXIII.

In 1978, [[Albino Luciani]] became the first pope to use two names for his regnal name when he took the name [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]], including the "I". He took the "John Paul" name to honor both John XXIII and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]]. With the unexpected death of John Paul I a little over a month later, [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] took the name John Paul II to honor his immediate predecessor.

[[Antipope]]s also have regnal names, and also use the ordinal to show their position in the line of previous pontiffs with their names. For example, [[David Bawden]] took the name Michael I when declared pope in 1990.

===Coptic Church===
[[Coptic Pope]]s also choose regnal names distinct from their given names.

=== Islamic caliphates ===

[[File:Coat of Arms of Great Britain (1714-1801).svg|thumb|The Royal Arms of Great Britain from 1714 to 1801, with crest, supporters and motto]]

The '''Royal coat of arms of Great Britain''' was the [[coat of arms]] representing royal authority in the sovereign state of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], in existence from 1707 to 1801. The kingdom came into being on 1 May 1707, with the [[political union]] of the [[kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[kingdom of England]], which included [[Wales]]. With the 1706 [[Treaty of Union]] (ratified by the [[Acts of Union 1707]]), it was agreed to create a single kingdom, encompassing the whole of the island of Great Britain and its outlying islands, but not Ireland, which remained a separate realm under the newly created British crown.

On 1 January 1801, the royal arms of Great Britain were superseded by those of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], when Great Britain was united with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] by the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union of 1800]] following the suppression of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].

The '''royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom''', or the '''Royal Arms''' for short, is the official [[coat of arms]] of the [[British monarch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308050901/https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |archivedate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 10, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/362346/hmg_identity_system_guidelines_2012.pdf Government identity system (2012)]. HM Government. "The Queen is Head of State, and the United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
The royal coat of arms is personal to the Queen and..."&lt;/ref&gt; currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. These arms are used by the Queen in her official capacity as monarch of the [[United Kingdom]]. Variants of the Royal Arms are used by other members of the [[British royal family]]; and by the [[British government]] in connection with the administration and government of the country. In [[Scotland]], there exists a separate version of the Royal Arms, a variant of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]]. The arms in [[banner of arms|banner form]] serve as basis for the monarch's official flag, known as the ''[[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]]''.

In the standard variant used outside of Scotland, the shield is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England; in the second, the rampant lion and double tressure [[fleur-de-lis#Other European monarchs and rulers|flory-counterflory]] of Scotland; and in the third, a [[Clàrsach|harp]] for Ireland.&lt;ref name="Boutell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooke-Little |first=J.P., FSA |authorlink=John Brooke-Little |title=Boutell's Heraldry |origyear=1950 |edition=Revised |year=1978 |publisher=Frederick Warne LTD |location=London |isbn=0-7232-2096-4 |pages=205–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] is a [[Lion (heraldry)|statant guardant lion]] wearing the [[St Edward's Crown]], himself on another representation of that crown. The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporters|supporter]] is a likewise crowned English lion; the sinister, a Scottish [[unicorn]]. According to legend a free unicorn was considered a very dangerous beast; therefore the heraldic unicorn is chained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldicsculptor.com/royal%20unicorn.htm|title=Heraldic Sculptor- Accessed 29 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were both supporting unicorns in the [[royal coat of arms of Scotland]].

In the greenery below, a [[thistle]], [[Tudor rose]] and [[shamrock]] are depicted, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively. This [[armorial achievement]] comprises the [[motto]], in [[French language|French]], of [[English monarchs]], ''[[Dieu et mon Droit]]'' (God and my Right), which has descended to the present [[royal family]] as well as the [[Order of the Garter#Heraldry|Garter circlet]] which surrounds the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]], inscribed with the [[Order of the Garter|Order]]'s motto, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'' (Shame on him who thinks evil).
The official [[blazon]] of the Royal Arms is:

{{quote|''Quarterly, first and fourth Gules three Lions passant gardant in pale Or armed and langued Azure (for England), second quarter Or a Lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland), third quarter Azure a Harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland), the whole surrounded by the Garter; for a Crest, upon the Royal helm the Imperial Crown Proper, thereon a Lion statant gardant Or imperially crowned Proper; Mantling Or and Ermine; for Supporters, dexter a Lion rampant gardant Or crowned as the Crest, sinister a Unicorn Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a Coronet Or composed of Crosses patées and Fleurs-de-lis a Chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or. Motto "Dieu et mon Droit" in the compartment below the shield, with the Union Rose, Shamrock and Thistle engrafted on the same stem.''&lt;ref name="Boutell"/&gt;}}

==Uses==
[[File:St Andrew's church - royal arms - geograph.org.uk - 1708484.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Royal Arms as used by the [[House of Stuart]] (these being of William III and Mary II (1688-1694/1702))]]

The Royal Arms as shown above may only be used by the Queen herself. They also appear in courtrooms, since the monarch is deemed to be the fount of judicial authority in the United Kingdom and law courts comprise part of the ancient royal court (thus so named).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditions of the courts|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/court-traditions/|website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges are officially Crown representatives, demonstrated by the display of the Royal Arms behind the judge's bench in all UK courts (with the exceptions of the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in the [[City of London]], where behind the [[Justices of the Peace]] stands a sword upright flanked by the arms of the City and the Crown). In [[Northern Ireland]], the Royal Arms cannot be displayed in courtrooms or on court-house exteriors. There are a few exceptions, with the Royal Arms allowed to be displayed in the courtrooms of the [[Royal Courts of Justice, Belfast|Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast]] and the courts in Armagh, Banbridge, Downpatrick, Magherafelt, or Omagh. They may be shown on the exterior of court buildings that had them in place prior to the 2002 law.&lt;ref&gt;Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c.26) 66 [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/26/body/enacted Display of Royal Arms at courts]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the United Kingdom is governed in the monarch's name, the British Government also uses the Royal Arms as a national symbol of the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Government identity system HM Government&lt;/ref&gt; and, in that capacity, the coat of arms can be seen on several government documents and forms, passports, in the entrance to embassies and consulates, etc. However, when used by the government and not by the monarch personally, the coat of arms is often represented without the helm. This is also the case with the sovereign's Scottish arms, a version of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]].

The Royal Arms have regularly appeared on the coinage produced by the [[Royal Mint]] including, for example, from 1663, the [[Guinea (British coin)|Guinea]] and, from 1983, the [[British one pound coin]].  In 2008, a new series of designs for all seven coins of £1 and below was unveiled by the Royal Mint, every one of which is drawn from the Royal Arms.  The full Royal Arms appear on the one pound coin, and sections appear on each of the other six, such that they can be put together like a puzzle to make another complete representation of the Royal Arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx The New Designs Revealed&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404064611/http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx|date=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch grants [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]]s to select businesses and tradespeople which supply the Royal Household with goods or services. This entitles those businesses to display the Royal Arms on their packaging and stationery by way of advertising.

It is customary (but not mandatory) for churches throughout the United Kingdom whether in the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church of Scotland]] to display the Royal Arms to show loyalty to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasures of Britain and Treasures of Ireland|edition=1976|publisher=Drive Publications|page=677}} Retrieved 15 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/royal-arms-in-church/|title=Royal Arms in church|publisher=Intriguing History|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A banner of the Royal Arms, known as the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]], is flown from the royal palaces when the monarch is in residence, [[Windsor Castle]] and [[Buckingham Palace]] being her principal abodes; and from public buildings only when the monarch is present. This protocol equally applies to the monarch's principal residences in Scotland (the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] and [[Balmoral Castle]]), where the Royal Standard (Scottish version) is flown. When the monarch is not in residence the [[Union Flag]], or in Scotland the ancient [[Royal Standard of Scotland]], is flown.

The widely sold British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' uses the Hanoverian Royal Arms as a logo, whereas its sister publication, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', displays the current Royal Arms.

The Royal Arms are also displayed in all courts in [[British Columbia]], as well as in other Canadian provinces such as [[Ontario]], where the judges are appointed by Crown authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Welcome&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Arms were also displayed by all [[Governor-General of Australia|Viceroys of Australia]] as representation of their Crown authority.

The Royal Arms are also used and displayed in the Supreme Courts of South Australia and Victoria.

The Royal Arms are also the coat of arms for the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].

The Royal Arms were controversially used by former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] as her official letterhead from {{circa|1997|lk=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Summers |first2=Ben |last2=Streeter |first=Michael |title=The strange case of Lady Thatcher and Her Majesty's coat of arms |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-strange-case-of-lady-thatcher-and-her-majestys-coat-of-arms-1274739.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 March 1997 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Royal coat of arms of Scotland}}
Since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, a separate version of the Royal Arms has been used in [[Scotland]], giving the Scottish elements pride of place.

The [[shield]] is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the lion ''rampant'' of Scotland; in the second, the three lions ''passant guardant'' of England; and in the third, the harp of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].

The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] atop the [[Crown of Scotland]] is a red lion, seated and forward facing, itself wearing the Crown of Scotland and holding the two remaining elements of the [[Honours of Scotland]], namely the Sword of State and the Sceptre of Scotland. This was also the crest used in the Royal Arms of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The motto, in [[Scots language|Scots]], appears above the crest, in the tradition of [[Scottish heraldry]], and is an abbreviated form of the full motto: ''[[In My Defens God Me Defend]]''.

The supporters change sides and both appear wearing the crowns of their respective Kingdom. The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporter]] is a crowned and chained unicorn, symbolising Scotland. The [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] supporter is a crowned lion, symbolising England. Between each supporter and the shield is a lance displaying the flag of their respective Kingdom.

The coat also features both the motto ''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]'' (No one wounds (touches) me with impunity) and, surrounding the shield, the [[Livery collar|collar]] of the [[Order of the Thistle]]. On the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] are a number of thistles, Scotland's national flower.

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
[[File:St Mary, Stone, Kent - Royal Arms - geograph.org.uk - 1490059.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The current version of the Royal Arms, displayed in the parish church of [[Stone, Kent]].]]
Unlike the [[Acts of Union 1707]] with Scotland, the [[Acts of Union 1800]] with Ireland did not provide for a separate Irish version of the royal arms.{{dubious|1706/7 says "the quartering the Arms, and the Rank and Precedency of the Lyon King of Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland as may best suit the Union, be left to her Majesty" and 1800 says nothing for or against. If the contention is that the 1800 acts have been interpreted as FORBIDDING separate royal arms for Ireland, then that requires specific cites.|date=November 2017}} The [[Arms of Ireland#Achievement|crest of the Kingdom of Ireland]] (''on a wreath Or and Azure, a tower triple-towered of the First, from the portal a hart springing Argent attired and unguled Or'') has had little or no official use since the union. When the [[Irish Free State]] established [[great Seal of the Irish Free State|its own seals]] in the 1930s, the "Fob Seal" used on [[letter of credence|letters of credence]] varied the British arms by having the harp in two quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=2243 |title=Memorandum on external seals |first=Joseph |last=Walshe |authorlink=Joseph Walshe |date=26 October 1937 |work=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy, Vol. V No. 97 |publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]] |accessdate=20 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harp quarter of the Royal Arms represents Ireland on both the English and Scottish versions.  Likewise, one English quarter is retained in the Scottish version, and one Scottish quarter is retained in the English version.  Thus, England, Scotland and Ireland are represented in all versions of the Royal Arms since they came under one monarch.
By contrast, there is no representation at all for [[Wales]] in the Royal Arms, as at the Act of Union 1707 Wales was an integral part of the Kingdom of England pursuant to the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]]; thus, it has been argued Wales is represented in the English coat of arms.  However the argument is somewhat disengenuous as in 1535 the Welsh Dragon was already part of the Tudor Coat of Arms. Upon the accession of the Tudor monarchs, who were themselves of Welsh descent, a Welsh Dragon was used as a supporter on the Royal Arms. This was dropped by their successors, the Scottish House of Stuart, who replaced the Tudors' dragon supporter with the Scottish unicorn
In the 20th century, the [[coat of arms of Wales|arms of the principality of Wales]] were added as an inescutcheon to the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|coat of arms]] of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], and a banner of those arms with a green inescutcheon bearing the prince's crown is flown as his personal standard in Wales.  The so-called [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] are a heraldic badge rather than a coat of arms upon a shield, but they are not Welsh in any case.  They derive, in fact, from the English Princes of Wales (who may owe them to an exploit of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] at the [[Battle of Crécy]]) and carry the motto ''{{lang|de|Ich dien}}'' ([[German language|German]], "I Serve").  In any event, they do not form part of the Royal Arms, as opposed to the heraldic achievement of the Prince of Wales, who drops them upon his accession as King.

==History==

===Kingdoms of England and Scotland===
The current royal arms are a combination of the arms of the former kingdoms that make up the [[United Kingdom]], and can be traced back to the first arms of the kings of England and kings of Scotland. Various alterations occurred over the years as the arms of other realms acquired or claimed by the kings were added to the royal arms. The table below tracks the changes in the royal arms from the original arms of King Richard I of England, and William I, King of Scots.

==Other variants==

===Royal family===
Members of the [[British royal family]] are granted their own personal arms which are based on the Royal Arms. Only children and grandchildren in the male line of the monarch are entitled to arms in this fashion: the arms of children of the monarch are differenced with a three-point [[Label (heraldry)|label]]; grandchildren of the monarch are differenced with a five-point label. An exception is made for the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, who bears a three-point label. Since 1911, the arms of the Prince of Wales also displays an [[inescutcheon]] of the ancient [[Coat of Arms of the Principality of Wales|arms of the Principality of Wales]]. 
Queens consort and the wives of sons of the monarch also have their own personal coat of arms. Typically this will be the arms of their husband impaled with their own personal arms or those of their father, if armigerous. However, the consorts of a Queen regnant are not entitled to use the Royal Arms. Thus [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] has been granted his own personal arms.

Currently the following members of the royal family have their own arms based on the Royal Arms:

Various versions of the Royal Arms are used by [[Her Majesty's Government]] in the United Kingdom, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and courts in some parts of the Commonwealth.

HM Government generally uses a simplified version of the Royal Arms with a crown replacing the helm and crest, and with no compartment.&lt;ref&gt;GOV.UK, Departments, agencies and public bodies [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations]. Retrieved 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Scotland, the [[Scotland Office]] and the [[Advocate General for Scotland]] use the Scottish version, again without the [[Helmet|helm]] or [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], and the same was used as the day-to-day logo of the [[Scottish Executive]] until September 2007, when a [[rebranding]] exercise introduced the name ''[[Scottish Government]]'', together with a revised logo incorporating the [[flag of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170305194010/http://news.gov.scot/news/new-lord-lyon-king-of-arms-appointed |www.gov.scot New Lyon King-of-arms appointed]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government continues to use the Arms on some official documents.

The simplified Royal Arms also feature:

* on all [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]];
* on the cover of all [[British passport|UK passports]];
* as an inescutcheon on the [[diplomatic flag]]s of British Ambassadors; and
* on all acts of the [[Anguilla House of Assembly]], the [[Sovereign Base Areas]], [[Pitcairn Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] administrations.

Various courts in the Commonwealth also continue to use the Royal Arms:

Furthermore:
* A version of the crest of the Royal Arms, as used in Scotland, is used by the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]], the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] and the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]].
* The crowned shield of the Royal Arms encircled by the Garter is used by the [[Home Office]] and by the [[Parliament of Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/|title=Parliament of Victoria - Home|website=www.parliament.vic.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The crowned shield of the Royal Arms is used by the [[Royal Mint]].

The '''Seven Bishops''' of the [[Church of England]] were those imprisoned and tried for [[seditious libel]] related to their opposition to the second [[Declaration of Indulgence]], issued by [[James II of England|James II]] in 1688. In a major embarrassment to the Crown, they were found not guilty.

==Background==
The Declaration granted broad religious freedom in England by suspending penal laws that enforced conformity to the Church of England, by allowing persons to worship in their homes or chapels as they saw fit, and by ending affirming religious oaths as a requirement for employment in government office.

==Sequence of events==
The Declaration of Indulgence had originally been given out on 4 April 1687. The King republished it, with some new prefatory matter, on 25 April 1688. On 4 May the King and his council ordered the bishops that the declaration should be read in all the (Anglican) churches – those of London on 20 May and outside London on 27 May and the two following Sundays. This was the only way to make the document swiftly and generally known, which was James's straightforward object. The Anglican clergy felt it a challenge to themselves, for many of them were opposed to the toleration of Roman Catholics and Nonconformists, as were very many English people.

Nine days passed with no objection; then, on 13 May, at [[Lambeth Palace]], Compton (Bishop of London), Sancroft (Archbishop of Canterbury), Turner (Bishop of Ely) and White (Bishop of Peterborough), resolved to defy James's order.&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, Robert, ''Bloody Jeffreys: the hanging judge'', André Deutsch, London, 1989,  p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; They summoned seven others, of whom four actually came – Lake (Bishop of Chichester), Lloyd (St Asaph), Trelawny (Bristol) and Ken (Bath and Wells) – to a meeting of eight. Compton was under suspension following another dispute with the King. The others, known as the Seven Bishops, signed a petition requesting that they be excused; they claimed that the King did not have the legal right to make exemptions from statutes, the dispensing power having been declared illegal by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Edward, ''The Protestant Bishop: Being the Life of Henry Compton, 1632–1713, Bishop of London'', [[Longmans, Green and Co.]], 1956, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the King's power to dispense individuals from the provisions of a statute – that is to declare that the individual need not observe its provisions – had recently been reaffirmed in ''Godden v Hales''&lt;ref&gt;''State Trials'' Vol. IX pp1196-9&lt;/ref&gt; after James had dismissed judges he knew to be opposed to his exercise of it.  The  Lord Chief Justice, Sir [[Edward Herbert (judge)|Edward Herbert]],  had  ruled   in ''Godden v Hales''  that : "It is an indispensable prerogative in the Kings of England to dispense with  penal laws in particular cases, and upon particular necessary reasons...Of those reasons and those necessities the King himself is the sole judge."&lt;ref&gt;''State Trials''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of Friday, 18 May, the Seven Bishops (apart from Sancroft) presented their petition to the King, who read it and was furious. He proclaimed it "a standard of rebellion" and dismissed them, saying that he expected to be obeyed and that "God hath given me this dispensing power and I will maintain it."&lt;ref name=C117&gt;Carpenter, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was soon printed and distributed for sale on the streets of London; Compton may have been responsible for that.&lt;ref name=C117/&gt; The seven were put on trial for seditious libel.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council were not sure what to do, but summoned the Bishops to appear before them on Friday 8 June,&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; which became known as Black Friday.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Macaulay, Thomas Babington]], ''The History Of England From the Accession of James II'', Vol. II, Chapter VIII, [[Donohue, Henneberry &amp; Co.]], 1890, p. 332. [[s:The History Of England From the Accession of James II/Chapter VIII#II.332]].&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops could have given their own [[recognizance]]s for coming up for trial, and thereby avoided being imprisoned before their trial. Sancroft had urged this; even Compton agreed to it; but Sancroft changed his mind. The bishops seem to have been angling for a delay in the trial proceedings – by refusing to give recognizances, they would have the right to delay the trial until the beginning of Michaelmas term on 23 October. The king, however, wanted a speedy trial, and the only way to get it, apart from convincing the Bishops to give their own recognizances, was to imprison them in the [[Tower of London]] before their trial; within the Tower, however, they had complete freedom.  Their imprisonment lasted only a week and had the effect, desired by the king, of speeding up the proceedings so that a trial could be held in June.&lt;ref&gt;Sowerby, Scott, ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution'', Harvard University Press, 2013, pp. 178-81.&lt;/ref&gt; But, in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s deliberately ironic words, "Compton had had the satisfaction of seeing a vast popular gathering acclaiming these fathers in God on the way to the horrid dungeon of a Tyrant."&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, Hilaire, "James the Second", Faber &amp; Gwyer, 1928, p. 216. The section from "The Declaration of Indulgence had originally" to this quotation is paraphrased from this book.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Lord Jeffreys]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], advised the King to drop the prosecution; on being overruled he asked caustically if the King was prepared to take advice from his Ministers   or whether "the Virgin Mary is to do all".&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The trial took place at the Court of [[King's Bench]] on 29 June, with Sir [[Thomas Powys (judge)|Thomas Powys]] the Attorney General and [[Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Gray's Inn|William Williams]] the Solicitor General prosecuting and Sir [[Robert Wright (judge)|Robert Wright]], the [[Lord Chief Justice]] as the presiding judge, sitting with [[John Powell (judge)|John Powell]], Richard Holloway and [[Richard Allibond]]. The bishops had a formidable team of defence counsel, headed by [[Francis Pemberton]], a former Lord Chief Justice, and including former Attorneys General [[Robert Sawyer (Attorney General)|Sir Robert Sawyer]] and [[Sir Creswell Levinz]], as well as [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|John Somers]], a future [[Lord Chancellor]].&lt;ref name=K391&gt;Kenyon, J.P., ''The Stuart Constitution'', 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury deliberated all night and the bishops were found not guilty on the morning of 30 June. There was great rejoicing; those opposed to the royal dispensing power had gained their victory.

The verdict was a  political disaster for the Government, largely due to its own ineptitude. Of the four judges only Allibond, a [[Roman Catholic]], showed any real desire for a conviction, while Powell and Holloway would clearly be happy with an acquittal. Powys,  the Attorney General,  through sheer incompetence,   almost caused the case to collapse at the outset by failing to prove that the Petition had been presented at all;&lt;ref name=K391/&gt;  Williams, the Solicitor General, handled the case with greater skill, but his bitter personal feud with  Lord Chief Justice Wright  (who in the course of his summing-up to the jury  accused him, without any relevance whatever to the trial,  of taking bribes)&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; can scarcely have helped  the prosecution. A modern historian remarked that the trial "had a strong element of the grotesque".&lt;ref name=K391/&gt;

==Bishops==

The Seven Bishops were:

* [[William Sancroft]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]
* [[Thomas Ken]], [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]]
* [[John Lake (bishop)|John Lake]], [[Bishop of Chichester]]
* [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], [[Bishop of St Asaph]]
* [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet|Jonathan Trelawny]], [[Bishop of Bristol]]
* [[Francis Turner (bishop)|Francis Turner]], [[Bishop of Ely]]
* [[Thomas White (bishop)|Thomas White]], [[Bishop of Peterborough]]

Despite their petition and their trial, five of these bishops (all but Lloyd and Trelawny) remained loyal to James II after the [[Glorious Revolution]] and were among the nine bishops who became [[Nonjuring schism|non-juror]]s, refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], and losing their bishoprics as a result.

==Rights of petition and religion==
The bishops exercised the right to petition preserved in ''[[Magna Carta]]'' (1215) (clause 61). The following year Parliament cited James II's trial of the Seven Bishops as a grievance. It explicitly preserved the right of petition in the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] (1689).
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he said Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons,&amp;nbsp;... do in the first place (as their ancestors in like case have usually done) for the vindicating and asserting their ancient rights and liberties declare&amp;nbsp;...
That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king, and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal;&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These rights of petition for redress of grievances and of religion and conscience were preserved in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The '''seventy disciples''' or '''seventy-two disciples''' (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the '''Seventy[-two] Apostles''') were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to ({{bibleref2|Luke|10:1}}) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521–524; 543–545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''. Although apostles and disciples exist in many extant churches and denominations, the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] is the only current one to use [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|Seventy]] as a title for a priesthood office.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=25|showsource=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text ==

The passage from [[Luke 10]] reads (in [[Young's Literal Translation]]):{{quote|
And after these things, the Lord did appoint also other seventy, and sent them by twos before his face, to every city and place whither he himself was about to come, then said he unto them, `The harvest indeed [is] abundant, but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.

`Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves; carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way;  and into whatever house ye do enter, first say, Peace to this house; and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall turn back. `And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things they have, for worthy [is] the workman of his hire; go not from house to house, and into whatever city ye enter, and they may receive you, eat the things set before you, and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of God hath come nigh to you.

`And into whatever city ye do enter, and they may not receive you, having gone forth to its broad places, say, And the dust that hath cleaved to us, from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the reign of God hath come nigh to you; and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city. `Wo to thee, Chorazin; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had reformed; but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you. `And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades thou shalt be brought down. `He who is hearing you, doth hear me; and he who is putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting me away, doth put away Him who sent me.'

And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, `Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;' and he said to them, `I was beholding the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen; lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by any means shall hurt you; but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens.'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–20|YLT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Analysis ==
This is the only mention of the group in the [[Bible]]. The number is ''seventy'' in some manuscripts of the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] (such as [[Codex Sinaiticus]]) and [[Caesarean text-type|Caesarean]] text traditions but ''seventy-two'' in most other Alexandrian and [[Western text-type|Western]] texts. It may derive from the [[Sons of Noah|seventy nations of Genesis 10]] or the many other occurrences of the number seventy in the Bible, or the seventy-two translators of the [[Septuagint]] from the [[Letter of Aristeas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]]'s ''Textual Commentary on the Greek NT''&lt;/ref&gt; In translating the ''[[Vulgate]]'', [[Jerome]] selected the reading of seventy-two.

The ''Gospel of Luke'' is not alone among the [[synoptic gospels]] in containing multiple episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on missions. The first occasion ({{bibleref2|Luke|9:1–6}}) is closely based on the "limited commission" mission in ''[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]'' {{bibleref2|Mark|6:6–13}}, which however recounts the sending out of the [[twelve apostles]], rather than seventy, though with similar details. The parallels (also [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|9:35}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:1}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:5–42}}) suggest a common origin in the hypothesized [[Q document]]. Luke also mentions the [[Great Commission]] to "all nations" ({{bibleref2|Luke|24:44–49}}) but in less detail than Matthew's account and {{bibleverse|Mark|16:19–20}} mentions the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]].

What has been said to the seventy (two) in {{bibleref2|Luke|10:4}} is referred in passing to the Twelve in {{bibleref2|Luke|22:35}}:
:He said to them, "When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?" "No, nothing," they replied.

The [[feast day]] commemorating the seventy is known as the "[[Synaxis]] of the Seventy Apostles" in Eastern Orthodoxy, and is celebrated on [[January 4 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|January 4]]. Each of the seventy apostles also has individual commemorations scattered throughout the [[liturgical year]] (see [[Eastern Orthodox Church calendar]]).

== The record by Pseudo-Hippolytus ==
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] was a disciple of [[Irenaeus]], a disciple of [[Polycarp]], a disciple of [[Apostle John]]. Hippolytus's works were considered lost prior to their discovery at a monastery on [[Mount Athos]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 3&lt;/ref&gt; While his major work ''The Refutation of All Heresies'' was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, ''On the Twelve Apostles of Christ'' and ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'', are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 254–56&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# [[James the Just|James the Lord's brother]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Cleopas]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], who supplied the vacant place in the number of the twelve apostles.
# [[Thaddeus of Edessa|Thaddeus]], who conveyed the epistle to Augarus ([[Abgar V]]).
# [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]], who baptized Paul, and was bishop of Damascus.
# [[St Stephen|Stephen]], the first martyr.
# [[Philip the Evangelist|Philip]], who baptized the eunuch.
# [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], bishop of Nicomedia, who also was the first that departed, 11 believing together with his daughters.
# [[Nicanor the Deacon|Nicanor]] died when Stephen was martyred.
# [[Timon the Deacon|Timon]], bishop of Bostra.
# [[Parmenas]], bishop of Soli.
# [[Nicolas the Deacon|Nicolaus]], bishop of Samaria.
# [[Barnabas]], bishop of Milan.
# [[Mark the Evangelist]], bishop of Alexandria.
# [[Luke the Evangelist]].
These two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.

He sought out Paul when everyone else was afraid of him, bringing him to the apostles.  It was Barnabas whom the apostles first sent to [[Antioch]] with Paul. Their long association was broken only when Barnabas was determined to take his cousin Mark, whom Paul did not trust just then, on a missionary journey. The three were later reconciled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10471">The '''Splat Pack''' is a collection of [[independent filmmakers]] who, since 2002, have directed, written and produced numerous R-rated [[horror film]]s, notable for their [[Low-budget film|low budgets]] and extreme ultra-violence.&lt;ref name="the splat pack"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Splat Pack |first=Rebecca |last=Winters Keegan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1549299,00.html |newspaper= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= October 22, 2006|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was coined by [[Alan Jones (film critic)|Alan Jones]] of ''[[Total Film]]''.&lt;ref name="blood brothers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Blood Brothers  |first=Alan |last=Jones |authorlink=Alan Jones (film critic) |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117956275.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;s=h&amp;p=0 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been credited with bringing back ultra-violent movies, as well as moving away from [[MPAA film rating system|PG-13]] rated movies and into the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] spectrum, all while operating with [[independent film|low budgets]].&lt;ref name="the splat pack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horrors"&gt;''New York Post''; October 22, 2006.

{{Theosophy}}

'''St. Germain''' (also sometimes referred to as '''Master Rakoczi''' or '''Master R''') is a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] and post-Theosophical teachings, responsible for the [[New Age]] culture of the [[Age of Aquarius]] and identified with the '''[[Count of St. Germain]]''' (''[[floruit|fl.]]'' 1710–1784), who has been variously described as a [[courtier]], [[adventurer]], [[charlatan]], inventor, [[Alchemy|alchemist]], pianist, violinist and amateur composer.

==Legend==
Some write that his name St. Germain was invented by him as a French version of the Latin ''[[Sanctus Germanus]]'', meaning "Holy Brother".&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, pages 250 – 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, pages 254 – 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, pages 312 – 322&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ascended Master Teachings (but not in traditional Theosophy), the ''Master R'', or the ''Master Rakóczi'', is a separate and distinct being from St. Germain.

==Literature about St. Germain==

===Biographies===
There are several "authoritative" biographers who usually do not agree with one another. Probably the two best-known biographies are [[Isabel Cooper-Oakley]]'s ''The Count of St. Germain'' (1912) and [[Jean Overton-Fuller]]'s ''The Comte de Saint-Germain: Last Scion of the House of Rakoczy'' (1988). The former is a compilation of letters, diaries and private records written about the Count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century. Dr. Raymond Bernard's book ''The Great Secret – St. Germain'' is biographical and covers many aspects of the Count's life including his conflation with Sir [[Francis Bacon]] and the author of the [[Shakespeare]]an opus. [[Manly Palmer Hall]] in his ''[[Manly Palmer Hall#Works|The Secret Teachings of All Ages]]'', describes some of the same attributes as Dr. Bernard, including the attribution of the writings of Shakespeare to a great adept like Francis Bacon, who could be amalgamated with the Count of St. Germain.

There have also been numerous French and German biographies, among them ''Der Wiedergänger: Das zeitlose Leben des Grafen von Saint-Germain'' by [[Peter Krassa]], ''Le Comte de Saint-Germain'' by [[Marie-Raymonde Delorme]] and ''L'énigmatique Comte De Saint-Germain'' by [[Pierre Ceria]] and [[François Ethuin]].

===Occult biography===
A book titled ''The Great Secret, Count St. Germain'', by Dr. Raymond Bernard purports that St. Germain was actually [[Francis Bacon]] by birth, and later [[Baconian theory|authored the complete Plays attributed to Shakespeare]]. He also contends, as does the [[Saint Germain Foundation]] in Schaumburg, Illinois, that [[Francis Bacon]] was the child of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Lord Dudley]] but that it was kept quiet. According to the theory, Francis was raised by the Bacon family. Yet, throughout the [[Shakespeare]]an canon, there are numerous hints that the author knows of his true birth, as revealed in the explicit clues in the text of the plays themselves, in pictures, as well as the [[Bacon's cipher|cipher code that he employed]].

===Books claimed by Guy Ballard to have been dictated to him by Saint Germain===
Saint Germain is the central figure in the Saint Germain Series of Books published by the Saint Germain Press (the publishing arm of the Saint Germain Foundation). The first two volumes, ''Unveiled Mysteries'' and ''The Magic Presence'', written by [[Guy Ballard]] as "Godfré Ray King" describe Saint Germain as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]], like [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], who is assisting humanity. In these first two books, he discusses his personal experiences with Saint Germain and reveals many teachings that are in harmony with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and some other works referenced above. The third volume, ''The 'I AM' Discourses'', contains material that is foundational to the [[sacred scripture]]s of the "I AM" Religious Activity, founded in 1930, the first of the Ascended Master Teachings religions.

There are 20 Volumes in the Saint Germain Series of Books, which are also referred to as the "Green Books." Another work of great importance, the ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'', is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, [[Rembrandt]]'s famous painting at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, ''a.k.a.'' the [[Comte de Gabalis]], or the Count of the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]]. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard's pen name), wife of [[Guy Ballard]], talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the "I AM" Religious Activity.

===Claimed encounters with Saint Germain===
Several [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: 
* [[Annie Besant]] said that she met the Count in 1896.
* [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] claimed to have met him in Rome in 1926 and gave a physical description of him as having [[brown eyes]], [[Olive skin|olive colored skin]], and a pointed beard; according to Leadbeater, "the splendour of his Presence impels men to make obeisance".&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 32&lt;/ref&gt; Leadbeater said that Saint Germain showed him a robe that had been previously owned by a [[Roman Emperor]] and that Saint Germain told him that one of his residences was a [[castle]] in [[Transylvania]]. According to Leadbeater, when performing [[Incantations|magical rituals]] in his castle in Transylvania, Saint Germain wears "a suit of golden chain-mail which once belonged to a [[Roman Emperor]]; over it is thrown a magnificent cloak of [[Tyrian purple]], with on its clasp a [[heptagram|seven-pointed star]] in diamond and [[amethyst]], and sometimes he wears a glorious robe of violet."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 240&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guy Ballard]], founder of the [["I AM" Activity]], claimed that he met Saint Germain on [[Mount Shasta]] in California in August 1930, and that this initiated his "training" and experiences with other [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] in various parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edgar Cayce]], the "Sleeping Prophet", was asked while in trance if Saint Germain was present. Cayce's reply was: "When needed." (From reading # 254–83 on 2/14/1935.)
* [[Dorothy Leon]], living author, has claimed to have had several encounters with Saint Germain and is an avowed disciple of his.
* [[Miroslav Zimmer]], living poet, claim to have met St Germain in the Mala Fatry mountains in 2011 in the company of a Sam Bennett.
* [[David Narozny]], living Czech music composer, claims to have met St Germain in Pruhonice 23.5.2014.
*[[Peter Mt. Shasta]], living spiritual teacher, claims that in 1973 St. Germain materialized before him in Muir Woods, Marin County, California, USA. He describes this meeting in ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. He also claims to have had many other physical as well as etheric meeting with him as well as other Masters.
*[[David Christopher Lewis]], living spiritual teacher, claims that Saint Germain first came to him in person on June 10, 2004 in his home in Paradise Valley, Montana and continued to come many times thereafter, dictating what is now in the book: Saint Germain on Advanced Alchemy: HeartStreaming in the Aquarian Age .&lt;ref&gt;"SAINT GERMAIN ON ADVANCED ALCHEMY" (Meru Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric activities===
Many groups honor Saint Germain as a [[supernatural being]] called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an [[Ascended master]]. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers such as the ability to teleport, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]], walk through walls, and to inspire people by [[telepathy]], among others.

The Theosophical Society after Blavatsky's death considered him to be a [[Mahatma]], Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Adept. [[Helena Blavatsky]] said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some [[esotericism|esoteric]] groups credit him with inspiring the [[Founding Fathers]] to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], as well as providing the design of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. (See [[Hall, Manly P.|Manly Palmer Hall]]'s ''Secret Teachings of All Ages.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Hall, Manly P.]] ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' "An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings Concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages" H.S. Crocker Company, Inc. 1928 See chapter on "St. Germain"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Age]] beliefs, Saint Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel [[amethyst]], and the ''[[Maltese cross]]'' rendered in violet (usually the ''iron cross style cross patee'' version). He is also regarded as the "Chohan of the Seventh Ray"&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed to have been dictated by St. Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biographical (actually [[Hagiography|hagiographical]]) sketch of Saint Germain, pages 80–90 (The original edition of this book is printed in violet type on cream colored paper.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Theosophical Society]], the [[Seven Rays]] are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long [[Astrological Age]]. Since according to Theosophy the next [[Astrological Age]], the [[Age of Aquarius]], will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called "The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius".  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is "The God of Freedom for [[Solar system|this system of worlds]]."  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former [[Astrological age|Astrological Age]] Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the "Hierarch of the [[Age of Pisces]]".

In the works authored by Alice A. Bailey, Saint Germain is called ''Master Rakóczi'' or the ''Master R.''&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three – Division A – Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt;  (In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Rakoczi [ otherwise known as the Great Divine Director ] is regarded as Saint Germain's teacher in the Great White Brotherhood of Ascended Masters.) Alice A. Bailey's book ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain's spiritual title is said to be ''Lord of Civilization,'' and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Page 667&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. Alice A. Bailey stated that "sometime after AD 2025," the Jesus, the Master Rakóczi (Saint Germain), Kuthumi, and others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would "externalise"&lt;!--British spelling of externalize--&gt;, i.e., descend from the spiritual worlds, and interact in visible tangible bodies on the Earth in [[ashram]]s, surrounded by their disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 530&lt;/ref&gt; Alice A. Bailey said that St. Germain is the "manager of the executive council of the Christ"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 508&lt;/ref&gt;(Theosophists regard "the Master Jesus" and "Christ" as two separate and distinct beings.  They believe in the [[Gnostic]] [[Christology]] espoused by [[Cerinthus]] (''fl.'' c. 100 AD), according to which "Christ" is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the [[ministry of Jesus]]). According to certain Theosophists, "Christ" is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the "executive council of the Christ" is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius.

===Previous incarnations===
According to [[The Theosophical Society]] (not to be confused with the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]]) and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Saint Germain was incarnated as: (see notes 1, 2, and 3 for sources): (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain's incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.)

* Ruler of a [[Root race#Early beginnings of the Aryan root race|Golden Age civilization centered in a city called "The City of the Sun"]] 70,000 years ago located in the then lush and verdant area that is now the [[Sahara Desert]], originally a colony sent out from [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]].
* High priest in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|the civilization of Atlantis]] 13,000 years ago, serving in the ''Order of Lord Zadkiel'' in the ''Temple of Purification'', located in an Atlantean colony that had been sent out from the main island of [[Atlantis]] that had been established on the island now called [[Cuba]].
* [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], 11th-century BC religious leader in Israel who served as prophet, priest, and last of the Hebrew judges.
* [[Hesiod]], Greek poet whose writings serve as a major source of insight into Greek mythology and cosmology (c. 700 BC).
* [[Plato]], Philosopher who studied with students of Pythagoras and scholars in Egypt. He established his own school of philosophy at the Academy in Athens. (427–347 BC).
* [[St. Joseph|Saint Joseph]], 1st century AD, Nazareth. Husband of Mary and guardian of Jesus.
* [[Saint Alban]], late 3rd or early 4th century, town of Verulamium, renamed St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England. First British martyr – he had sheltered a fugitive priest, became a devout convert, and was put to death for disguising himself as the priest so that he could die in his place.
* [[Proclus]], c. 410 – 485 AD. Athens. The last major Greek Neoplatonic philosopher. He headed the Platonic Academy and wrote extensively on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and grammar.
* [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]], c. 5th or 6th century, Britain. Magician and counselor at King Arthur's Camelot who inspired the establishment of the Order of the Knights of the Round Table.
* [[Roger Bacon]], c. 1220–1292 AD, England. Philosopher, educational reformer, and experimental scientist. Forerunner of modern science renowned for his exhaustive investigations into alchemy, optics, mathematics, and languages.&lt;ref&gt;Although [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claims that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of Saint Germain and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] (the main Ascended Master Teachings religion) also accepts this, some sources and some Ascended Master Activities believe that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of the Ascended Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|El Morya]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organizer behind the scenes for the Secret Societies in Germany in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The creation of a possibly fictional character named "[[Christian Rosenkreuz]]" was inspired by his efforts.
* [[Christopher Columbus]], 1451–1506 AD. Believed to have been born in Genoa, Italy and settled in Portugal. Landed in America in 1492 during the first of four voyages to the New World sponsored by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Spain
* [[Francis Bacon]], 1561–1626, England. Philosopher, statesman, essayist and literary master, [[Baconian theory|author of the Shakespearean plays]] (according to the [[Ascended Master Teachings]]), father of inductive science, and herald of the [[scientific revolution]].

===Ascension into masterhood===
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon made it appear that he died on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and he even attended his own "funeral" in disguise.  It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to [[Transylvania]] (then part of [[Hungary]], now part of [[Romania]]) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the [[Rakóczi|royal family of Hungary]]. Finally on 1 May 1684 he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of [[alchemy]]) his physical Ascension (attaining [[immortality]] and eternal youth [ the sixth level of Initiation]) at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name "Saint Germain."&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed by the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] to have been [[Channeling (mediumistic)|dictated]] by Saint Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biologographical sketch of history of Saint Germain, pages 80–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article "Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements" by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' 5 October 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

In the traditional [[Chilota mythology]] of [[Chiloé]], the '''Trauco''' is a humanoid creature of small stature - similar to a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] or [[goblin]] - who lives in the deep forests. It has an ugly face, and legs without feet.

== Legend ==
The '''Trauco''' is a mythical entity who inhabits the woods of [[Chiloé]], an island in the south of [[Chile]]. It has a powerful magnetism that attracts young and middle-aged women. According to myth, the Trauco's wife is the wicked and ugly '''Fiura'''. The trauco carries a small stone-headed hatchet that he uses to strike trees in the forest to symbolize his sexual potency.

Whomever the Trauco chooses will go to him, even if she is sleeping, and fall enraptured at his feet. No woman can resist his magical attraction; all have sexual intercourse with him. Some men of Chiloé fear the Trauco, as his gaze can be deadly.

When a single woman is pregnant and no one steps forward as the father, people assume that the Trauco is the father. Because the Trauco is irresistible, the woman is considered blameless. The Trauco is sometimes invoked to explain sudden or unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women.

== Media ==

The Trauco appears in [[The Luke Coles Book Series]] by [[Josh Walker (author)|Josh Walker]] where he functions as an antagonist in some of the subplots.

{{Close Relationships}}
A '''wife''' is a [[female]] [[Significant other|partner]] in a continuing [[marital relationship]].

The term continues to be applied to a woman who has separated from her partner, and ceases to be applied to such a woman only when her marriage has come to an end, following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of her spouse. On the death of her partner, a wife is referred to as a [[widow]], but not after she is divorced from her partner.

The rights and obligations of a wife in relation to her partner and her status in the community and in law vary between cultures and have varied over time.

==Summary==
[[Image:Wedding and Engagement Rings 2151px.jpg|thumbnail|A [[white gold]] [[wedding ring]] and a single-[[diamond]], [[gold]]-banded engagement ring. In many cultures, wives show their marital status through various symbols.]]
The word is of Germanic origin, from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''wībam'', "woman". In [[Middle English]] it had the form ''wif'', and in Old English ''wīf'', "[[woman]] or wife". It is related to Modern [[German language|German]] ''Weib'' (woman, female),&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaer27.uni-trier.de/CLL/Frouwe/weib.html Etymology of "Weib"] (broken link to a uni personal account)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Danish language|Danish]] ''viv'' (wife, usually poetic) and may derive ultimately from the Indo-European root ''ghwībh-'' "shame; pudenda" (cf. [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] B ''kwīpe'' and Tocharian A ''kip'', each meaning "female pudenda", with clear sexual overtones).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IHbQgz1nZYC&amp;dq=american+heritage+indo-european+roots&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kqRjTOfLCIbvcMyjxJYF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Watkins, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', p. 32.]&lt;/ref&gt; The original meaning of the phrase "wife" as simply "woman", unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife, is preserved in words such as "[[midwife]]" and "[[fishmonger|fishwife]]".

In many cultures, marriage is generally expected that a woman will take her husband's [[surname]], though that is not universal. A married woman may indicate her [[marital status]] in a number of ways: in [[Western culture]] a married woman would commonly wear a [[wedding ring]] but in other cultures other [[Visual markers of marital status|markers of marital status]] may be used. A married woman is commonly given the [[honorific]] title "[[Mrs]]", but some married women prefer to be referred to as "[[Ms.|Ms]]", a title which is also used when the marital status of a woman is unknown.

==Related terminology==
[[File:Bride at Nikah.jpg|thumb|A young bride at her [[Nikah]].]]
A woman on her wedding day is usually described as a ''[[bride]]'', even after the ''[[wedding]] ceremony'', while being described as a wife is also appropriate after the wedding or after the honeymoon. Her partner is known as the ''[[groom|bridegroom]]'' during the wedding, and within the marriage is called her ''[[husband]]''.

In the older custom, still followed, e. g., by Roman Catholic ritual&lt;!-- and elsewhere !--&gt;, the word ''bride'' actually means [[fiancée]] and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent (the actual marriage act); from then on, even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing, the woman is a wife, and no longer a bride, and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple.

"Wife" refers to the institutionalized relation ''to the other spouse'', unlike [[mother]], a term that puts a woman into the context of her children. In some societies, especially historically, a ''[[concubine]]'' was a woman who was in an ongoing, usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her, often because of a difference in social status.

The term ''wife'' is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law (including [[religious law]]), not to a woman in an informal [[cohabitation]] relationship, which may be known as a girlfriend, partner, cohabitant, significant other, [[concubine]], [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] etc. However, a woman in a so-called [[common law marriage]] may describe herself as a common law wife, de facto wife, or simply a wife.  Those seeking to advance [[gender neutrality]] may refer to both marriage partners as "spouses", and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing "wife" and "husband" with "spouse". A former wife whose spouse is deceased is a ''[[widow]]''.

==Termination of the status of a wife==
The status of a wife may be terminated by [[divorce]], [[annulment]], or the [[death]] of a spouse. In the case of divorce, terminology such as ''former-wife'' or ''ex-wife'' is often used. With regard to annulment, such terms are not, strictly speaking, correct, because annulment, unlike divorce, is usually [[ex post facto law|retroactive]], meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place. In the case of the death of the other spouse, the term used is [[widow]]. The social status of such women varies by culture, but in some places, they may be subject to potentially harmful practices, such as [[widow inheritance]] or [[levirate marriage]]; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26356373|title=India's invisible widows, divorcees and single women|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless, as in the case of those cultures that practiced [[Sati (practice)|sati]], a [[funeral]] ritual within some [[Asia]]n communities, in which a recently widowed woman [[Self-immolation|committed suicide by fire]], typically on the husband's [[funeral pyre]].

==Legal rights of the wife==
{{Further|Coverture|Marital power}}
The legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century, and still are, in many jurisdictions subject to debate. This subject was in particular addressed by [[John Stuart Mill]], in ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869). Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to husbands that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to wives. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie. (2007) “The Intersection of Gender, Class and Nationality and the Agency of Kytherian Greek Women.” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. August 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;In 1981, Spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings {{cite web|url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824032832/http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and France&lt;ref&gt;Although married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission in 1965,{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092212/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children), it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. [http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s. In various [[marriage laws]] around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of [[Iran]] states at Article 1105: ''"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311161504/http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exchanges of goods or money==
[[Image:Thai Bride Price 2008.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional, formal presentation of the [[bride price]] at a [[Thailand|Thai]] engagement ceremony.]] 
Traditionally, and still in some parts of the world, the bride or her family bring her husband a ''[[dowry]]'', or the husband or his family pay a ''[[bride price]]'' to the bride's family, or both are exchanged between the families; or the husband pays the wife a ''[[dower]]''. The purpose of the dowry varies by culture and has varied historically. In some cultures, it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family; but during the marriage, the dowry was often made [[inalienable right|inalienable]] by the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2005, ''dowry''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, dowries continue to be expected in parts of [[South Asia]] such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and conflicts related to their payment sometimes result in violence such as [[dowry deaths]] and [[bride burning]].

==Changing of name upon marriage==
{{Main|Maiden and married names}}
In some cultures, particularly in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] [[Western world|West]], wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married. For some, this is a controversial practice, due to its tie to the historical doctrine of [[coverture]] and to the historically subordinated roles of wives. Others argue that today this is merely a harmless tradition that should be accepted as a free choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29804450|title=Why should women change their names on getting married?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women's rights, and have restricted or banned it; for example, since 1983, when [[Greece]] adopted a new [[marriage law]] which guaranteed [[gender equality]] between the spouses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#|title=AROUND THE WORLD; Greece Approves Family Law Changes|first=|last=Reuters|date=26 January 1983|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; women in Greece are required to ''keep'' their birth names for their whole life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/women-change-name-after-marriage-greece|title=Should women change their names after marriage? Ask a Greek woman - Heather Long|author=Heather Long|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childbearing==
[[File:Non marital by countries.gif|350 px|thumb|Percentage of births to unmarried women, selected countries, 1980 and 2007.&lt;ref name="non_mar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db18.htm|title=Changing Patterns of Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States |work=CDC/National Center for Health Statistics|date=May 13, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Traditionally, and still in many cultures, the role of a wife was closely tied to that of a [[mother]], by a strong expectation that a wife ought to bear children, while, conversely, an unmarried woman should not have a [[Legitimacy (family law)|child out of wedlock]]. These views have changed in many parts of the world. Children born outside marriage have become more common in many countries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Although some wives in particular in Western countries [[Childfree|choose not to have children]], such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world. In [[northern Ghana]], for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risk of threats and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some religions are interpreted as requiring children in marriage; for instance [[Pope Francis]] said in 2015 that choosing not to have children was "selfish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/11/pope-francis-the-choice-to-not-have-children-is-selfish|title=Pope Francis: not having children is selfish|author=Stephanie Kirchgaessner|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in cultures==
{{Hatnote|The various divisions of the following chapters share the previous terminology in [[English language]], notwithstanding religious and cultural, but also customary differences.}}

===Antiquity===
[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]]
Many traditions like a dower, dowry and bride price have long traditions in antiquity. The exchange of any item or value goes back to the oldest sources, and the wedding ring likewise was always used as a symbol for keeping faith to a person.

===Christianity===

====Historical status====
Christian cultures claim to be guided by the [[New Testament]] in regard to their view on the position of a wife in society as well as her marriage. For example, the New Testament condemns divorce for both men and women (1 Cor 7:10–11), and assumes [[monogamy]] on the part of the husband: the woman is to have her "own" husband, and the husband was to have his "own" wife (1 Cor 7:2). In medieval Christianity, this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives. As a result, divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern West, particularly in the medieval and [[early modern period]], and husbands in the Roman, later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife.

In pre-modern times, it was unusual to marry for love alone,&lt;ref&gt;William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650–1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; although it became an ideal in literature by the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Burney, Evelina, Lowndes 1778, and Seeber, English Literary History of the Eighteenth Century, Weimar 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Roman law required brides to be at least 12 years old, a standard adopted by Catholic [[canon law]]. In Roman law, first marriages to brides aged 12–25 required the consent of the bride and her father, but by the late antique period Roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent.&lt;ref&gt;Anti Arjava, ''Women and Law in Late Antiquity'' Oxford, 1996, pp. 29–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament allows a widow to marry any Christian she chooses (1 Cor 7:39). In the 12th century, the Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents' approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely.&lt;ref&gt;John Noonan, "The Power to Choose" '' Viator'' 4 (1973) 419–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry against their parents' approval.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sheehan, "The formation and stability of marriage in fourteenth century England" ''Medieval Studies'' 33 (1971) 228–63.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church's policy of considering clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran church sought to end these practices, with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Gottlieb, ''The family in the Western World from the Black Death to the Industrial Age'' Oxford, 1993, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament made no pronouncements about wives' property rights, which in practice were influenced more by secular laws than religion. Most influential in the pre-modern West was the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], except in English-speaking countries where English [[common law]] emerged in the High Middle Ages. In addition, local customary law influenced wives' property rights; as a result wives' property rights in the pre-modern West varied widely from region to region. Because wives' property rights and daughters' inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems, the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly. Under Roman law, daughters inherited equally from their parents if no will was produced,&lt;ref&gt;Antti Arjava, ''Women and law in late antiquity'' Oxford, 1996, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; under the English common law system, which dates to the later medieval period, daughters and younger sons were usually excluded from landed property if no will was produced. In addition, Roman law recognized wives' property as legally separate from husbands's property,&lt;ref&gt;A. Arjava, ''Women and law in late antiquity'' Oxford, 1996, 133-154.&lt;/ref&gt; as did some legal systems in parts of Europe and colonial Latin America. In contrast, English common law moved to a system where a wife with a living husband ("feme couvert") could own little property in her own name.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth M. Craik, Marriage and property, Aberdeen 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to easily support herself, marriage was very important to most women's economic status. This problem has been dealt with extensively in literature, where the most important reason for women's limited power was the denial of equal education and equal property rights for females.&lt;ref&gt;In the 18th and 19th centuries, which contained much criticism of these facts, see also [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[A Vindication of the Rights of Women]], [[Boston]] 1792&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was assessed by the English conservative moralist Sir [[William Blackstone]]: "The husband and wife are one, and the husband is the one."&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England&lt;/ref&gt; Married women's property rights in the English-speaking world improved with the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]] and similar legal changes, which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names. Until late in the 20th century, women could in some regions or times sue a man for [[wreath money]] when he took her [[virginity]] without taking her as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus 2004, ''Kranzgeld''.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a woman did not want to marry, another option was entering a [[convent]] as a [[nun]].&lt;ref&gt;Though cloisters' practices were not bound by modern national borders, see sources [https://web.archive.org/web/20060301163747/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_3_33/ai_61372238 for Spain], [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v014/14.3mcgough.html for Italy], and [http://www.ianpaisley.org/article.asp?ArtKey=family for Britain]&lt;/ref&gt; to become a "[[bride of Christ]]",&lt;ref name="Taking The White Veil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jesus-messiah.com/charlotte/html/white-veil.html|title=The White Veil|website=jesus-messiah.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state in which her chastity and economic survival would be protected.&lt;ref name="Taking The White Veil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04060a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Cloister|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both a wife and a nun wore veils, which proclaimed their state of protection by the rights of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Evangelisti, Wives, Widows, And Brides Of Christ: Marriage And The Convent In The Historiography Of Early Modern Italy, [http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=5618 Cambridge 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Much more significant than the option of becoming a nun, was the option of non-religious spinsterhood in the West. As first demonstrated quantitatively by John Hajnal, in the 19th and early 20th centuries the percentage of non-clerical Western women who never married was typically as high as 10–15%, a prevalence of female celibacy never yet documented for any other major traditional civilization.&lt;ref&gt;John Hajnal, "European marriage patterns in perspective" in D.E. Glass and D.E.C. Eversley eds. ''Population in History'' London, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, early modern Western women married at quite high ages (typically mid to late 20s) relative to other major traditional cultures. The high age at first marriage for Western women has been shown by many parish reconstruction studies to be a traditional Western marriage pattern that dates back at least as early as the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Flynn, ''The European Demographic System, 1500-1820'' Johns Hopkins, 1981, pp. 124–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary status====
In the 20th century, the role of the wife in Western marriage changed in two major ways; the first was the breakthrough from an "institution to companionate marriage";&lt;ref&gt;"Companionship marriage" and "companionate marriage" are synonyms (the latter being the older one), although the term usually refers to a relationship based on equality, it might instead refer to a marriage with mutual interest in their children, {{cite web |url=http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=290368 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712030304/http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=290368 |archivedate=2007-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time, wives became distinct [[legal entities]], and were allowed their own property and allowed to sue. Until then, partners were a single legal entity, but only a husband was allowed to exercise this right. The second change was the drastic alteration of middle and upper-class family life, when in the 1960s these wives began to work outside their home, and with the social acceptance of [[divorce]]s the single-parent family, and [[stepfamily]] or "blended family" as a more "individualized marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=290368|title=Stepfamily as individualized marriage|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712030304/http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=290368|archivedate=12 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a woman may wear a [[wedding ring]] in order to show her status as a wife.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Vicki. "A 'Real Man's Ring': Gender and the Invention of Tradition." ''Journal of Social History''. Summer 2003 pp. 837–856&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western countries today&lt;!--like the [[United Kingdom]] pro KEEP:source from that area, pro HIDE: Source underlines Western tradition exemplified by a uk, non-national source--&gt;, married women usually have an [[education]], a [[profession]] and they (or their husbands) can take time off from their work in a legally procured system of [[ante-natal care]], statutory [[maternity leave]], and they may get [[maternity pay]] or a maternity [[allowance (money)|allowance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/WorkAndFamilies/DG_10026556|title=Pregnant employees' rights|work=direct.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of marriage, as opposed to unmarried pregnant women, allows the [[spouse]] to be responsible for the child, and to speak on behalf of their wife; a partner is also responsible for the wife's child in states where they are automatically assumed to be the biological legal parent.&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Vice versa, a wife has more legal authority in some cases when she speaks on behalf of a spouse than she would have if they were not married, e.g. when her spouse is in a coma after an accident, a wife may have the right of advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;The restrictions of her abilities to do this vary immensely even within a legal system, see [http://www.seniorlaw.com/fishman.htm case NY vs. Fishman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220202903/http://www.seniorlaw.com/fishman.htm |date=2007-02-20 }}, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; If they [[divorce]], she also might receive—or pay—[[alimony]] (see [[Law and divorce around the world]]).

===Islam===
[[Women in Islam]] have a range of rights and obligations (see main article [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam]]). Marriage takes place on the basis of a [[Islamic marriage contract|marriage contract]]. The [[arranged marriage]] is relatively common in traditionalist families, whether in Muslim countries or as first or second generation immigrants elsewhere.

Women in general are supposed to wear specific clothes, as stated by the [[hadith]], like the [[hijab]], which may take different styles depending on the culture of the country, where traditions may seep in.{{Quran-usc|24|31}}{{Quran-usc|33|59}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novq12y1.html|title=Clothes|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085957/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novq12y1.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The husband must pay a ''[[mahr]]'' to the bride, which is similar to the [[dower]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]] verse 4;4&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the wife in Islam is seen as a protected, chaste person that manages the household and the family. She has the ever important role of raising the children and bringing up the next generation of Muslims. In Islam, it is highly recommended that the wife remains at home although they are fully able to own property or work. The husband is obligated to spend on the wife for all of her needs while she is not obligated to spend even if she is wealthy. [[Muhammad]] is said to have commanded all Muslim men to treat their wives well. There is a Hadith by [[Al-Tirmidhi]], in which Muhammad is said to have stated "The believers who show the most perfect faith are those who have the best character and the best of you are those who are best to their wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.al-islam.org/women-islam-versus-women-judaeo-christian-tradition-myth-reality-sherif-muhammad-abdel-azeem/divorce |title=Divorce |work=Women In Islam Versus Women In The Judaeo-Christian Tradition: The Myth &amp; The Reality |accessdate=August 6, 2018 |first=Sherif Muhammad |last=Abdel Azeem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Muslim married women are not distinguished from unmarried women by an outward symbol (such as a wedding ring). However, women's wedding rings have recently been adopted in the past thirty years from the Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/westernized.html|title=ZAWAJ.COM: Articles and Essays About Marriage in Islam|work=zawaj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Indo-Aryan languages]], a wife is known as ''Patni'', which means a woman who shares everything in this world with her husband and he does the same, including their identity. Decisions are ideally made in mutual consent. A wife usually takes care of anything inside her household, including the family's health, the children's education, a parent's needs.

The majority of Hindu marriages in rural and traditional India are arranged marriages. Once they find a suitable family (family of same caste, culture and financial status), the boy and the girl see and talk to each other to decide the final outcome. In recent times however the western culture has had significant influence and the new generations are more open to the idea of marrying for love.

Indian law has recognized  rape, sexual, emotional or verbal abuse of a woman by her husband as crimes. 
In [[Hinduism]], a wife is known as a ''Patni'' or ''Ardhangini'' (similar to "the better half") meaning a part of the husband or his family. In Hinduism, a woman or man can get married, but only have one husband or wife respectively.

In India, women may wear vermillion powder on their foreheads, an ornament called Mangalsutra (Hindi मंगलसूत्र ) which is a form of necklace, or rings on their toes (which are not worn by single women) to show their status as married women.

===Buddhism and Chinese folk religions===
[[China]]'s family laws were changed by the [[Communist]] revolution; and in 1950, the [[People's Republic of China]] enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Women in Japan]], [[Law of Japan]]

==Expectation of fidelity and violence related to adultery==

{{Main|Adultery}}
{{Further|Honor killing|Stoning|Crime of passion}}
There is a widely held expectation, which has existed for most of recorded history and in most cultures, that a wife is not to have [[sexual relation]]s with anyone other than her legal husband. A breach of this expectation of [[fidelity]] is commonly referred to as [[adultery]] or [[extramarital sex]]. Historically, adultery has been considered to be a serious [[offense (law)|offense]], sometimes a [[crime]], and even a [[sin]]. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly as a ground for a [[divorce]]. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], it may affect the status of children, the [[custody of children]]; moreover, adultery can result in social [[ostracism]] in some parts of the world. 
In addition, [[Affinity (canon law)|affinity]] rules of the Christian Church, of Judaism and of Islam prohibit an ex-wife or widow from engaging in sexual relations with and from marrying a number of relatives of the former husband.

In parts of the world, adultery may result in violent acts, such as [[honor killings]] or [[stoning]]. Some jurisdictions, especially those that apply [[Sharia law]], allow for such acts to take place legally.

As of September 2010, stoning is a legal punishment in countries such as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[Iran]], [[Yemen]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and some states in [[Nigeria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Handley|first=Paul|title=Islamic countries under pressure over stoning|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ixvYN7oeF8ehN9beAHZ4G_YlfKeA|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=AFP|date=11 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for [[Zina|zina al-mohsena]] ("adultery of married persons").&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Stoning|url=http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/faq_stoning|publisher=violence is not our culture|accessdate=14 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025158/http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/faq_stoning|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winamac''' was the name of a number of [[Potawatomi]] leaders and warriors beginning in the late 17th century. The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was soon transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]]. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg.

The Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the [[Fox Wars]] in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the [[War of 1812]]. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.

== Wilamet ==
In 1681, a group of Native Americans from several [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[New England]] accompanied French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] on an expedition to the west.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"&gt;Clifton, 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these Natives, Wilamet (or Ouilamette or Wilamek), was appointed by La Salle to serve as a laison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilamet was adopted by the [[Potawatomi]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sleeper-Smith, ''Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2001), 175n35.&lt;/ref&gt; and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was eventually transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"/&gt; Before long, he was recognized by the French as the "chief" of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"&gt;Clifton, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or ''okama''&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;), but was instead a "chief" appointed by the French.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the [[Franco-Indian alliance]]. According to historian [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], "as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief".&lt;ref&gt;White, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering [[Iroquois]] influence in the Lake Michigan region.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"/&gt; In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Cadillac]] against the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, Wilamet and [[Onanghisse]] (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief,&lt;ref&gt;White, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; represented the Potawatomis at the great [[Treaty of Montreal]], which ended the war with the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fox Wars]] (1712–1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"&gt;Clifton, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe.&lt;ref&gt;White, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"/&gt; The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 89; Edmunds, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812 era==
{{further|Indiana in the War of 1812|Illinois Territory in the War of 1812}}
During the [[War of 1812]] era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"&gt;Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt; American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the "anti-American" or "hostile" Winamek and the "pro-American" or "friendly" Winamek.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 528; Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-American Winamac===
The "anti-American" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the [[Osage people|Osages]], Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor [[Ninian Edwards]] demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief [[Chief Gomo|Gomo]] informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to [[Prophetstown (village)|Prophetstown]] in Indiana, headquarters of the anti-American resistance movement led by the [[Tenskwatawa|Shawnee Prophet]] and his brother [[Tecumseh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with chiefs [[Shabbona]] and [[Waubonsie]], Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] at Prophetstown in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winamac began the organization for the 1812 [[siege of Fort Wayne]]. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio.  What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce.  Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort.  Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander.  Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended.

After the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent [[Matthew Elliott (loyalist)|Matthew Elliott]]. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan ([[Spemica Lawba]]), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-American Winamac===
The "pro-American" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash.  Beginning in 1807 he and [[Five Medals]] and [[Topinabee (I)|Topinabee]] continued to ask the American government for agricultural help.  The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people.  In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land.  A council was called at [[Fort Wayne]] in September.  Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession.  When {{convert|3|e6acre|km2}} were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi.  Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands.  The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio.  Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing.  Winamac provide information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown.  Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison.  Here, [[Tecumseh]] denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.&lt;ref name=McPherson&gt;'''Indian Names in Indiana''' by Alan McPherson, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois.  To end the destruction, councils where held at [[Cahokia]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the [[Shawnee]] spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors.  When [[William Henry Harrison|Gov. Harrison]] marched north to [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] on the [[Tippecanoe River|Tippecanoe]] in November 1811, Winamac marched with him.  When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet.  Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by.  On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day.  When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops.  The Potawatomi were led by [[Shabbona]] with [[Waubonsie|Waubansee]] and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi).  The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages.  The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements.  Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements.  His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt;

When the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements.  He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived.  On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan.  Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt; [[Fort Dearborn]] fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16.

In September 1817, Winamac and [[Metea]] represented the eastern Potawatomis at the [[treaty of Fort Meigs]], in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Winamac died in 1821.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"/&gt;
