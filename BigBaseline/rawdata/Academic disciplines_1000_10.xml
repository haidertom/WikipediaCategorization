'''Agricultural spiritualism''' or the '''Spirit of Agriculture''' refers to the idea that the concepts of [[food]] [[production (economics)|production]] and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and the essential [[spiritualism|spiritual]] nature of [[human race|humanity]] are linked. It assumes that spirituality is inherent to human [[consciousness]], is perhaps a product of it, and is accessible to all who cultivate it. The association with [[agriculture]] includes such agricultural [[metaphor]]s as "cultivate" in language used by most [[mysticism|mystics]] across history.

Followers of this idea state the following reasons to justify this link:
*Agriculture was the preoccupation of the majority of the [[population]] of the world at the time that the major [[scripture]]s of the continuing [[religion]]s were compiled.
*The approach that agriculture takes to creating the optimal conditions for production of its [[harvest]] is the same as that recommended by the traditional religions for producing insight or wisdom.
*Historically, the adoption of agriculture liberated part of a population to focus on understanding of spirituality.

'''Arctic [[ecology]]''' is the scientific study of the relationships between [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] factors in the [[arctic]], the region north of the [[Arctic Circle]] (66 33’). This is a region characterized by stressful conditions as a result of extreme cold, low precipitation, a limited growing season (50–90 days) and virtually no sunlight throughout the winter. The Arctic consists of [[taiga]] (or [[boreal forest]]) and [[tundra]] [[biomes]], which also dominate very high elevations, even in the tropics. Sensitive [[ecosystems]] exist throughout the Arctic region, which are being impacted dramatically by [[global warming]]. The earliest inhabitants of the Arctic were the Neanderthals. Since then, many indigenous populations have inhabited the region, which continues to this day. Since the early 1900s, when Vilhjalmur Stefansson led the first major Canadian Arctic Expedition, the Arctic has been a valued area for ecological research.  In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established in Point Barrow, Alaska under the contract of the Office of Naval Research. This launched an interest in exploring the Arctic examining animal cycles, permafrost and the interactions between indigenous peoples and the Arctic ecology. During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, Fikret and Dyanna Jolly. “Adapting to Climate Change: Social- Ecological Resilience in a Canadian Western Arctic Community.” Conservation Ecology 5 (2001).

==Arctic environment==
To understand Arctic ecology, it is important to consider both the terrestrial and oceanic aspects of the region. A few important parts of this environment are sea ice and permafrost.

[[Sea ice]] is frozen seawater that moves with oceanic currents; it provides important habitat and a resting place for animals, particularly during the winter months. Over time, small pockets of salty seawater get trapped in the ice, and the salt is squeezed out. This causes the ice to become progressively less salty. Sea ice persists throughout the year, but there is less ice available during summer months.

Large portions of the land are also frozen during the year. [[Permafrost]] is substrate that has been frozen for a minimum of 2 years. There are two types of permafrost: discontinuous and continuous. Discontinuous permafrost is found in areas where the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below freezing ({{convert|0|°C|°F|0|disp=or}}); this forms in sheltered locations. In areas where the mean annual soil surface temperature is below {{convert|-5|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, continuous permafrost forms. This is not limited to sheltered areas and ranges from a few inches below the surface to over {{convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} deep. The top layer is called the [[active layer]]. It thaws in the summer and is critical to plant life.

==Biomes==
Moisture and temperature are major physical drivers of natural ecosystems. The more arid and colder conditions found at higher northern latitudes (and high elevations elsewhere) support [[tundra]] and [[boreal forests]]. The water in this region is generally frozen and [[evaporation]] rates are very low. Species diversity, [[nutrient]] availability, precipitation, and average temperatures increase as you move from the tundra to boreal forests and then to [[deciduous]] [[temperate]] ecosystems, which are found south of these Arctic biomes.

===Tundra===
Tundra is found from 55 ° to 80° N latitude in North America, Eurasia and Greenland. It can be found at lower latitudes at high elevations as well. The average temperature is {{convert|-34|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}; during the summer it is less than {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Average precipitation ranges from {{convert|10|to|50|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, and the permafrost is {{convert|400|-|600|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} thick. Plant species supported by tundra have small leaves, are short (74&amp;nbsp;mm to &lt;5 m), tend to be deciduous, have a high ratio of roots to shoots, and are composed mainly of perennial forbs, dwarf shrubs, grasses, lichens, and mosses.

===Boreal===
In comparison to tundra, [[boreal forest]] has a longer and warmer [[growing season]] and supports larger [[species diversity]], an increase in canopy height, vegetation density, and [[biomass]]. Boreal conditions can be found across northern North America and Eurasia. The boreal forests in the interior of the continents grow on top of permafrost due to very cold winters (see [[drunken trees]]), while much of the boreal forest has patchy permafrost or lack permafrost completely. The short (3–4 month) growing season in boreal forests is sustained by greater levels of rainfall (between {{convert|30|and|85|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year) than the tundra receives; This biome is dominated by closed canopy forests of evergreen conifers, especially spruces, fir, pine and tamarack with some diffuse-porous hardwoods. Shrubs, herbs, ferns, mosses, and lichens are also important species. Stand-replacing crown fires are very important to this biome, occurring as frequently as every 50–100 years in some parts.

==Adaptations to conditions==

===Humans===
Humans living in the Arctic region generally rely on warm clothing and buildings to protect them from the elements. [[Acclimatization]], or the adjustment to new conditions, appears to be the most common form of adaptation to cold environments. No genetic advantage has been found when different people groups or races are compared. There is no evidence that fat is grown in response to cold, although its presence is advantageous. Amazingly, most people living in the Arctic region live a lifestyle very connected to the environment, spending significant time outside and depending heavily on hunting and fishing.

===Other animals===
Animals that are active in the winter have [[adaptations]] for surviving the intense cold. A common example is the presence of strikingly large feet in proportion to body weight. These act like snowshoes, and can be found on animals like the [[snowshoe hare]] and caribou. Many of the animals in the Arctic are larger than their temperate counterparts ([[Bergmann’s rule]]), taking advantage of the smaller ratio of surface area to volume that comes with increasing size. This increases the ability to conserve heat. Layers of fat, plumage, and fur are also very effective [[Thermal insulation|insulators]] to help retain warmth and are common in Arctic animals including polar bears and marine mammals. Some animals also have digestive adaptations to improve their ability to digest woody plants either with or without the aid of microbial organisms. This is highly advantageous during the winter months when most soft vegetation is beneath the [[snow pack]].

Not all Arctic animals directly face the rigors of winter. Many migrate to warmer climates at lower latitudes, while others avoid the difficulties of winter by [[hibernation|hibernating]] until spring. Although these options might seem to be easy solutions to the difficulties of surviving an extreme environment, both are very expensive in terms of energy and risk of predation.

===Plants===
One of the most serious problems that plants face is ice crystal formation in the cells, which results in tissue death. Plants have two ways to resist freezing: avoid it or tolerate it. If a plant has taken the avoidance route, it has several different ways to evade freezing. It can build up insulation, have its stem close to the ground, use the insulation from snow cover, and supercool. When [[supercooling]], water is able to remain in its liquid state down to {{convert|-38|°C|°F|disp=or}} (compared to its usual {{convert|0|°C|°F|disp=or}} freezing point). After water reaches {{convert|-38|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, it spontaneously freezes and plant tissue is destroyed. This is called the [[nucleation point]]. The nucleation point can be lowered if dissolved [[solution|solute]]s are present.

If a plant has taken the tolerance route, it has several different ways to tolerate freezing. Some plants allow freezing by allowing [[extracellular]], but not [[intracellular]] freezing. Plants let water freeze in extracellular spaces, which creates a high vapor deficit that pulls water vapor out of the cell. This process dehydrates the cell and allows it to survive temperatures well below {{convert|-38|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}.

Another problem associated with extreme cold is cavitation. Ring-porous wood is susceptible to [[cavitation]] because the large pores that are used for water transport easily freeze. [[Cavitation]] is much less of problem in trees with [[ring-diffuse]] wood. In ring-diffuse wood, there is a reduced risk of cavitation, as transport pores are smaller. The trade-off is that these species are not able to transport water as efficiently.

==History of Arctic ecology==

===Early history===
Many different peoples had inhabited present-day [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] by AD 1000. Most of these people lived by hunting, gathering and fishing and never; [[agriculture]] was never done often in the region. Most of these peoples were [[nomad]]ic and their activity was largely seasonal. Early [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic Culture]] influenced the [[Plano cultures|Plano Culture]] by about 8000 BC. The Plano peoples and other cultural groups stemming from the Archaic Culture were notable for their use of spear-throwing technology, which likely made them able to maintain larger populations and expand their access to different foods. By AD 1000, the indigenous Arctic inhabitants have also developed other tools that improved their [[standard of living]], such as [[fire]], which was set to the woodlands to be used to drive [[deer]] to be hunted.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2007.  pgs. 25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English scientist [[William Scoresby]] explored the [[Arctic]] and wrote reports on its [[meteorology]], [[zoology]] and [[geophysics]]. Around this time, the Arctic region was becoming a major subject of imperial science. Though permanent observatories were not yet established, traveling scientists began to gather magnetic data in the Arctic in the early nineteenth century. In June 1831, [[James Clark Ross|Sir James Ross]] and a group of [[Eskimo]]s explored the Booth Peninsula in order to determine the exact location of the [[North Magnetic Pole|Magnetic North Pole]]. In the European Arctic, however, Scandinavian powers collected most of the scientific data as a result of early colonies established by Norsemen in Iceland and Greenland. Scientific expeditions to the Arctic started to happen more frequently by the middle of the nineteenth century. From 1338-1840, French La Recherche went on an expedition to the North Atlantic with a team of French, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish scientists. Between 1856 and 1914, the Swedes made about twenty-five expeditions to the Arctic island of [[Spitsbergen]] in [[Norway]]. As the Swedes expanded their influence in Spitsbergen, they used the area for economic as well as scientific motives through mining and resource extraction. During this time, the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Great Britain]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], and [[Germany]] also started to become more active in Spitsbergen.&lt;ref&gt;Sörlin, Sverker(2006)'Science, Empire, and Enlightenment: Geographies of Northern Field Science', European Review of History: Revue europeenne d'histoire,13:3,455 — 472&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established under the contract of the Office of Naval Research in Point Barrow, Alaska for the purpose of investigating the physical and biological phenomena unique to the Arctic. In 1948, Dr. Laurence Irving was appointed as the Scientific Director of the Arctic Research Laboratory and put in charge of coordinating various projects. Scientists performed fieldwork to collect data that linked new observations to prior widely accepted knowledge. Through the processes of soil sampling, surveying and photographing landscapes and distributing salmon tags, scientists demonstrated the significance of historical case studies in the study of environmental science. The ability to compare past and present data allowed scientists to understand the causes and effects of ecological changes. Around this time, geographers from McGill University were developing new methods of studying geography in the North. As laboratory research was beginning to trump field research, McGill geographers implemented use of aviation in research, helping knowledge production to occur in the laboratory instead of in the field. Aviation allowed researchers to remould the way they studied the Northern landscape and  indigenous people. Quick and easy travel using aircraft also promoted an integration of the Northern science with Southern community-based science, while changing the scale of ecology being studied. The ability to photograph, and observe the Arctic from an aircraft, provided researchers with a larger scope that allowed them to see a massive amount of space at one time, while also asserting objectivity. A photograph produces evidence, similar to laboratory data, yet it can be understood, circulated and accepted by the common people due to its aesthetic value.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. "A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960." Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, the Canadian government began taking initiatives to secure the continent, and to assert territorial authority over northern Canada, including the Arctic, which at the time had a dominant American presence. The Canadian government demonstrated their desire for national dominance and security by requiring permission from other nations to utilize their land for military initiatives. They also supported and implemented civilian initiatives including resource development, wildlife conservation and the social and economic development of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. "A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960." Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950’s, ecologist Charles Elton was drawn to the Arctic to study the existence, causes and effects of cycles in animal populations, while ecologists Frank Banfield and John Kelsal studied the factors, especially human impacts, influencing hunting and game populations on animals such as caribou.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. “Science and Spaces in the Northern Environment.” Environmental History 12 (2007): 867-94. Accessed on February 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s and 1970s brought a decrease in the desire to protect the Arctic as it was seen to lack a significant amount of biodiversity. This allowed for scientists to extend further research in the area. In June 1960, the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) was constructed, headed by General Duncan Hallock and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The two predecessor organizations that made up the CRREL were the Arctic Construction and Frost Effects Laboratory (ACFEL), and the Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment (SIPRE). The goal of the CREEL laboratory was to bring together the ACFEL and SIPRE to expand the size and scientific reputation of these organizations, solve problems in cold regions and explore the basic environmental characteristics of cold regions.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmund. CRREL's First 25 Years 1961-1986. Arctic: Technical Publications Writer- Editor, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, study and management of the Arctic was taken over by consulting firms hired and controlled by the government.

===Indigenous peoples and research===
As research in the Arctic region of northern [[North America]] became more frequent, conflicts between researchers and the indigenous peoples started to occur. Recently, the indigenous communities of the North American Arctic have played a direct role in setting ethical standards for research in the region. Scientists have combined the use of laboratory research and field research in the [[Polar region|Polar Regions]] to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its characteristics. Because of scientific research in the north, living in and traveling to the Arctic has become much safer. However, the indigenous peoples viewed the effects of the research and development in the area differently than the scientists did. Since the 1960s, indigenous peoples have been more politically active and began pursuing the recognition of their rights regarding land-claims and self-government institutions. Indigenous communities voiced their concern that this research could lead to undesirable changes to the region’s landscape and economy. Canadian officials responded to their concerns by addressing the responsibility of scientists to consult with indigenous communities before conducting research. In 1977, the Association of Canadian Universities for Northern Studies (ACUNS) was founded at Churchill, Manitoba to improve scientific activity in the region. ACUNS published a document aimed at promoting cooperation between the northern indigenous people and researchers called ''Ethical Principles for the Conduct of Research in the North (1982)''. The document was published in English, French, and Inuktitut so it could be clearly understood among different groups. Relationships between science and society in the Arctic continue to change and adapt based on the politics of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Korsmo, Fae L. and Amanda Graham. "Research in the North American North: Action and Reaction." Arctic 55.4 (2002): 319-328. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human ecology in the Arctic==
Evidence has been found of early humans in the early Würm-Weichsel period hunting large Arctic mammals in the [[Ice Age]] steppes of northern Europe. However, it is still unclear whether these humans were just temporary migrants or inhabitants of Arctic colonies at the time.

[[File:Inupiat Family from Noatak, Alaska, 1929, Edward S. Curtis (restored).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inuit peoples are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic.|Inuit peoples are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic.]]

The earliest inhabitants of the polar regions were the [[Neanderthals]], or ''Homo neanderthalensis'', who are considered to be an intermediate stage between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''. The Neandertalers made advances in the basic production of stone, bone antler and flint tools, which archaeologists call a [[Mousterian|Mousterian industry]]. About 40,000 years ago, the Neandertalers quickly disappeared and were replaced by modern humans, ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. Just a few thousand years after the sudden disappearance of the Neandertalers, modern humans occupied all the land that their predecessors had occupied. Some scientists believe that the Neandertalers were overcome by the incoming modern race, commonly called [[Cro-Magnon]] people, while others believe the race disappeared by integrating itself within the new population.

The [[Aurignacian|Aurignacoid]] (upper Paleolithic tool-making) tradition of the modern people is most associated with a feature called [[blade]]-and-core technology. According to Quaternary scientist C.V. Haynes, Arctic [[Cave painting|cave art]] also dates back to the Aurignacoid phase and climaxes during the end of the [[Pleistocene]], which encompasses subjects such as hunting and spirituality. People stemming from the [[Clovis culture]] populated northern regions of Canada and formed what led to the Northern Archaic and Maritime Archaic traditions at the end of the [[Late Glacial Maximum|Late Glacial]] period. Recently, small flint tools and artifacts from about 5,000 years ago were discovered that belonged to a culture now generally called the [[Arctic Small Tool tradition]]. The ASTt people are believed to be the physical and cultural ancestors of modern arctic [[Inuit]].&lt;ref&gt;*Young, Steven B. To the Arctic: An Introduction to the Far Northern World. New York: Wiley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, as European trade interests among the Northwest Company and the Hudson's Bay Company expanded into northern Canada, arctic indigenous peoples began to become more involved in the trade process. Increasingly more European goods, including kettles, iron tools, tobacco, alcohol, and guns, were bought and traded by the indigenous peoples within their communities. European imports in exchange for more primitive, native resources and tools made life for the indigenous more efficient and comfortable. Native societies in the early eighteenth century also began to buy guns from European traders, and these guns made hunting easier. They were also occasionally used in native etiquette, medicinal, and religious practices. Because of the natives' increased hunting efficiency, scarcity of resources became an issue in the region, a version of what American human ecologist Garrett Hardin called "the tragedy of the commons."&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2007. pgs. 64-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic peoples value spiritual connections with their environment, which leads to a spiritual understanding along with their scientific understanding. Their lifestyles, therefore, reflect not only activity that is economically efficient but also that which is in line with their spiritual beliefs and values. The Alaskan Athabascan people, for example, spiritually value the [[moose]]. State law acknowledges this spiritual belief and allows people to take moose for [[potlatch]]es outside of the usual hunting season. The indigenous peoples of the Arctic drawn from scientific, emotional and spiritual sources of information, which often does not agree with non-indigenous scientific observations.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. Climate Change and Arctic Sustainable Development: scientific, social, cultural and  educational challenges. Paris: UNESCO, 2009. pgs. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation and environmental issues==
Suspected worldwide anthropogenic climate change has been particularly evident in the Arctic. This is evident by warmer temperatures, melting glaciers, shorter durations of sea ice and changing weather and storm patterns. Scientists are especially concerned about four aspects of the continued projected warming of the Arctic.

First, [[thermohaline circulation]] is a series of underwater oceanic currents fueled by the salinity and temperature of seawater. Melting ice sheets would introduce vast amounts of fresh water into the North Atlantic, causing a change in density which could disrupt the currents. If this circulation slowed or stopped, the climates of northern Europe and North America would be strongly impacted.

Second, the melting of glaciers and sea ice is disrupting the lifestyles of a wide range of species. [[Polar bear]]s live on the sea ice for much of the year and find their food in the surrounding ocean waters. Recent projections suggest that global warming will lead to the disappearance of most summer sea ice within 40 years.

A third practical concern is the melting of permafrost due to climate change. Degradation of this permafrost is leading to major ground surface subsidence and pounding. The ground is literally melting away in many regions of the Arctic. The locations of towns and communities that have been inhabited for centuries are now in jeopardy. A condition known as drunken tree syndrome is being caused by this melting. Ground water and river runoffs are being negatively impacted as well. Although warming conditions might increase {{chem|CO|2}} uptake for photosynthetic organisms in some places, scientists are concerned that melting permafrost will also release large amounts of carbon locked in permafrost. Higher temperatures increase soil decomposition and if soil decomposition becomes higher than net primary production, global atmospheric carbon dioxide will in turn increase. Atmospheric sinks in the water table are also being reduced as the permafrost melts and decreases the height of the water table in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter_C._Oechel|Oechel, Walter]] and George Vourlitis. “The Effects of Climate Charge on Land—Atmosphere Feedbacks in Arctic Tundra Regions.” Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 9 (1994): 324-329. Accessed on February 23, 2014. Doi: 10.1016/0169-5347(94)90152-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the impacts of the release of carbon from the permafrost could be amplified by high levels of [[deforestation]] in the Boreal forests in Eurasia and Canada. This biome currently serves as a large [[carbon sink]], [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering]] large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, over half of the original forest has been or in danger of harvesting, largely for export. Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which facilitates increased warming of the earth.

==Further exploration==
In a [[meta analysis]] of the published work in aquatic ecosystems since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to be still unexplored. In addition, the North Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and Pacific Northwest), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world’s aquatic biodiversity. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in terrestrial ecosystems, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially marine ecosystems where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases (Moustakas &amp; Karakassis 2005). Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Arctic Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world’s aquatic biodiversity.

'''Art history''' is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts; that is [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/1841926/Evocative_Research_in_Art_History_and_Beyond_Imagining_Possible_Pasts_in_the_Ways_to_Heaven_Project Evocative Research in Art History and Beyond: Imagining Possible Pasts in the Ways to Heaven Project], Digital Creativity, 23, 1, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of prominent methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). "Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor–network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one’s country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country’s identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht Dürer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is small, and generally naturalistic in style, avoiding iconic elements like the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], which is barely discernible.]]

The [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach.  A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed [[Protestant]] agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] art produced during the [[High Renaissance]].  The [[Lutheran]] churches, as they developed, accepted a limited role for larger works of art in churches,&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; and also encouraged prints and book illustrations.  [[Calvinist]]s remained steadfastly opposed to art in churches, and suspicious of small printed images of religious subjects, though generally fully accepting secular images in their homes. 

In turn, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of [[art in Roman Catholicism]] to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art.  Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced.  Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like [[history painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]] and [[still life]].

==Art and the Reformation==
[[File:Wittenberg Stadtkirche Cranachalter.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Cranach the Elder]]'s Altarpiece at [[Wittenberg]]. An early Lutheran work depicting leading Reformers as Apostles at the [[Last Supper]].]]
[[File:Altaarretabel Domkerk.JPG|thumb|300px|Altar piece in [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht]], attacked by Calvinists in the [[Beeldenstorm]] in 1566. This [[retable]] became visible again after restoration in 1919 removed the false wall placed in front of it.]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] was a religious movement that occurred in Western Europe during the 16th century that resulted in a divide in Christianity between Roman Catholics and Protestants. This movement "created a North-South split in Europe, where generally Northern countries became Protestant, while Southern countries remained Catholic."&lt;ref&gt;''The Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Historicist and ''Causes of the Reformation.'' New Advent.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformation produced two main branches of [[Protestantism]]; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and the other the [[Reformed Churches]], which followed the ideas of [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  Out of these branches grew three main sects, the [[Lutheran]] tradition, as well as the [[Continental Reformed]] and [[Anglican]] traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith.&lt;ref name="Picken2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Picken|first=Stuart D.B.|title=Historical Dictionary of Calvinism|date=16 December 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810872240|page=1|quote=While Germany and the Scandinavian countries adopted the Lutheran model of church and state, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Hungary, what is now the Czech Republic, and Scotland created Reformed Churches based, in varying ways, on the model Calvin set up in Geneva. Although England pursued the Reformation ideal in its own way, leading to the formation of the Anglican Communion, the theology of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England were heavily influenced by Calvinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.&lt;ref name="Nuechterlein2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuechterlein|first=Jeanne Elizabeth|title=Holbein and the Reformation of Art|accessdate=29 April 2018|year=2000|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] in Germany allowed and encouraged the display of a restricted range of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the "ancient, apostolic church".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; The use of images was one of the issues where Luther strongly opposed the more radical [[Andreas Karlstadt]].  For a few years Lutheran altarpieces like [[Last Supper (Cranach)|the ''Last Supper'' by the younger Cranach]] were produced in Germany, especially by Luther's friend [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], to replace Catholic ones, often containing portraits of leading reformers as the apostles or other protagonists, but retaining the traditional [[depiction of Jesus]]. As such, "Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior."&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe|date=5 December 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|isbn=9781351921169|page=237|quote=As it developed in north-eastern Germany, Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior. This much is evident from the background of an epitaph pained in 1615 by Martin Schulz, destined for the Nikolaikirche in Berlin (see Figure 5.5.).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans proudly employed the use of the [[crucifix]] as it highlighted their high view of the [[Theology of the Cross]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarquardtJordan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marquardt|first1=Janet T.|last2=Jordan|first2=Alyce A.|title=Medieval Art and Architecture after the Middle Ages|date=14 January 2009|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443803984|page=71|quote=In fact, Lutherans often justified their continued use of medieval crucifixes with the same arguments employed since the Middle Ages, as is evident from the example of the altar of the Holy Cross in the Cistercian church of Doberan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories grew up of "indestructible" images of Luther, that had survived fires, by divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 89&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Lutherans, "the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image."&lt;ref name="Dixon2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=C. Scott|title=Contesting the Reformation|date=9 March 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|language=English|isbn=9781118272305|page=146|quote=According to Koerner, who dwells on Lutheran art, the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand there was a wave of [[Iconoclasm#Reformation iconoclasm|iconoclasm]], or the destruction of religious imagery.  This began very early in the Reformation, when students in [[Erfurt]] destroyed a wooden altar in the [[Franciscan]] [[friary]] in December 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 19, note 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Reformed Christianity showed consistent hostility to religious images, as [[idolatry]], especially [[sculpture]] and large paintings.  Book illustrations and prints were more acceptable, because they were smaller and more private.   Reformed leaders, especially [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], actively eliminated imagery from churches within the control of their followers, and regarded the great majority of religious images as idolatrous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vor.org/rbdisk/html/institutes/index.html Institutes, 1:11, section 7 on crosses]&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction was often extremely divisive and traumatic within communities, an unmistakable physical manifestation, often imposed from above, that could not be ignored.  It was just for this reason that reformers favoured a single dramatic ''coup'', and many premature acts in this line sharply increased subsequent hostility between Catholics and Calvinists in communities{{snd}} for it was generally at the level of the city, town or village that such actions occurred, except in England and Scotland.  

But reformers often felt impelled by strong personal convictions, as shown by the case of Frau Göldli, on which Zwingli was asked to advise.  She was a Swiss lady who had once made a promise to [[Apollinaris of Ravenna|Saint Apollinaris]] that if she recovered from an illness she would donate an image of the saint to a local convent, which she did. Later she turned Protestant, and feeling she must reverse what she now saw as a wrong action, she went to the convent church, removed the statue and burnt it. Prosecuted for [[blasphemy]], she paid a small fine without complaint, but flatly refused to pay the additional sum the court ordered be paid to the convent to replace the statue, putting her at risk of serious penalties.  Zwingli's letter advised trying to pay the nuns a larger sum on condition they did not replace the statue, but the eventual outcome is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of his life, after iconoclastic shows of force became a feature of the early phases of the [[French Wars of Religion]], even Calvin became alarmed and criticised them, realizing that they had become counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;      
[[File:St. Michaelis Oberkleen Blick nach Westen 02.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Daniel Hisgen]]'s paintings are mostly cycles on the parapets of Lutheran church galleries.  Here the Creation (left) to the [[Annunciation]] can be seen.]]

Subjects prominent in Catholic art other than Jesus and events in the [[Christian Bible|Bible]], such as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints were given much less emphasis or disapproved of in Protestant theology.  As a result, in much of northern Europe, the Church virtually ceased to commission figurative art, placing the dictation of content entirely in the hands of the artists and lay consumers.  Calvinism even objected to non-religious [[funerary art]], such as the [[heraldry]] and effigies beloved of the Renaissance rich.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  Where there was religious art, iconic images of [[Christ]] and scenes from the Passion became less frequent, as did portrayals of the saints and clergy.  Narrative scenes from the Bible, especially as book illustrations and prints, and, later, moralistic depictions of modern life were preferred. Both Cranachs painted allegorical scenes setting out Lutheran doctrines, in particular a series on ''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]''.  [[Daniel Hisgen]], a German [[Rococo]] painter of the 18th century in [[Upper Hesse]], specialized in cycles of biblical paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in Lutheran churches with an upper gallery, a less prominent position that satisfied Lutheran scruples.  Wooden organ cases were also often painted with similar scenes to those in Catholic churches.

Lutherans strongly defended their existing sacred art from a new wave of Calvinist-on-Lutheran iconoclasm in the second half of the century, as Calvinist rulers or city authorities attempted to impose their will on Lutheran populations in the "[[Second Reformation]]" of about 1560-1619.&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somehwat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 84.

A major theological difference between Protestantism and [[Catholicism]] is the question of [[transubstantiation]], or the literal transformation of the Communion wafer and wine into the body and blood of Christ, though both Lutheran and Reformed Christians affirmed the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], the former as a [[sacramental union]] and the latter as a [[pneumatic presence]].&lt;ref name="MattoxRoeber2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattox|first1=Mickey L.|last2=Roeber|first2=A. G.|title=Changing Churches: An Orthodox, Catholic, and Lutheran Theological Conversation|date=27 February 2012|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|language=English |isbn=9780802866943|page=54|quote=In this "sacramental union," Lutherans taught, the body and blood of Christ are so truly united to the bread and wine of the Holy Communion that the two may be identified. They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine. This divine food is given, more-over, not just for the strengthening of faith, nor only as a sign of our unity in faith, nor merely as an assurance of the forgiveness of sin. Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The "real presence" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and mantained. Intimate union with Christ, in other words, leads directly to the most intimate communion in his holy body and blood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protestant churches that were not participating in the iconoclasm often selected as altarpieces scenes depicting the Last Supper.  This helped the worshippers to recall their theology behind the [[Eucharist]], as opposed to Catholic churches, which often chose crucifixion scenes for their altarpieces to remind the worshippers that the sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Mass were one and the same, via the literal transformation of the Eucharist.

The Protestant Reformation also capitalized on the popularity of [[printmaking]] in northern Europe. Printmaking allowed images to be mass-produced and widely available to the public at low cost. This allowed for the widespread availability of visually persuasive imagery. The Protestant church was therefore able, as the Catholic Church had been doing since the early 15th century, to bring their theology to the people, and religious education was brought from the church into the homes of the common people, thereby forming a direct link between the worshippers and the divine.

There was also a violent propaganda war fought partly with [[popular prints]] by both sides; these were often highly scurrilous caricatures of the other side and their doctrines.  On the Protestant side, portraits of the leading reformers were popular, and their likenesses sometimes represented the Apostles and other figures in Biblical scenes such as the [[Last Supper]].

== Genre and landscape ==

After the early years of the reformation, artists in Protestant areas painted far fewer religious subjects for public display, although there was a conscious effort to develop a Protestant [[iconography]] of Bible illustration in book illustrations and [[old master print|prints]].  In the early Reformation artists, especially [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger|Younger]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], made paintings for churches showing the leaders of the reformation in ways very similar to Catholic saints.  Later Protestant taste turned from the display in churches of religious scenes, although some continued to be displayed in homes.  There was also a reaction against large images from classical mythology, the other manifestation of high style at the time.  This brought about a style that was more directly related to accurately portraying the present times. The traditions of landscapes and genre paintings that would fully flower in the 17th century began during this period.

[[Peter Bruegel]] (1525–1569) of Flanders is the great genre painter of his time, who worked for both Catholic and Protestant patrons.  In most of his paintings, even when depicting religious scenes, most space is given to landscape or peasant life in 16th century Flanders.  Bruegel’s ''Wedding Feast'', portrays a Flemish-peasant wedding dinner in a barn, which makes no reference to any religious, historical or classical events, and merely gives insight into the everyday life of the Flemish peasant. Another great painter of his age, [[Lucas van Leyden]] (1489–1533), is known mostly for his [[engraving]]s, such as ''The Milkmaid'', which depicts peasants with milk cows.  This engraving, from 1510, well before the Reformation,  contains no reference to religion or [[classicism]], although much of his other work features both.

[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 011.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peter Bruegel]]'s ''Peasant Wedding Feast''.]]
Bruegel was also an accomplished landscape painter. Frequently Bruegel painted agricultural landscapes, such as ''Summer'' from his famous set of the seasons, where he shows peasants harvesting wheat in the country, with a few workers taking a lunch break under a nearby tree. This type of landscape painting, apparently void of religious or classical connotations, gave birth to a long line of northern European landscape artists, such as [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].

With the great development of the engraving and printmaking market in [[Antwerp]] in the 16th century, the public was provided with accessible and affordable images. Many artists provided drawings to book and print publishers, including Bruegel. In 1555 Bruegel began working for ''The Four Winds'', a publishing house owned by [[Hieronymus Cock]]. ''The Four Winds'' provided the public with almost a thousand [[etching]]s and engravings over two decades. Between 1555 and 1563 Bruegel supplied Cock with almost 40 drawings, which were engraved for the Flemish public.

The courtly style of [[Northern Mannerism]] in the second half of the century has been seen as partly motivated by the desire of rulers in both the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and France to find a style of art that could appeal to members of the courtly elite on both sides of the religious divide.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, 98-101 on Rudolf, and Strong, Pt. 2, Chapter 3 on France, especially pp. 98-101, 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus religious controversy had the rather ironic effect of encouraging [[classical mythology]] in art, since though they might disapprove, even the most stern Calvinists could not credibly claim that 16th century mythological art really represented idolatry.

==Council of Trent==
[[File:Last Judgement (Michelangelo).jpg|thumb|[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]] fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]] by [[Michelangelo]] (1534-41) came under persistent attack in the [[Counter-Reformation]] for, among other things, nudity (later painted over for several centuries), not showing Christ seated or bearded, and including the pagan figure of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]].]]

During the Reformation a great divergence arose between the [[Catholic Church]] and the Protestant Reformers of the north regarding the content and style of art work. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and Reformed iconoclasm as a threat to the church and in response came together at the [[Council of Trent]] to institute some of their own reforms. The church felt that much religious art in Catholic countries (especially Italy) had lost its focus on religious subject-matter, and became too interested in material things and decorative qualities.  The council came together periodically between 1545 and 1563. The reforms that resulted from this council are what set the basis for what is known as the [[Counter-Reformation]].

Italian painting after the 1520s, with the notable exception of the art of [[Venice]], developed into [[Mannerism]], a highly sophisticated style, striving for effect, that concerned many churchman as lacking appeal for the mass of the population.  Church pressure to restrain religious imagery affected art from the 1530s and resulted in the decrees of the final session of the  [[Council of Trent]] in 1563 including short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, which were to have great impact on the development of Catholic art.  Previous Catholic [[Church council]]s had rarely felt the need to pronounce on these matters, unlike [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.

Statements are often made along the lines of "The [[decrees]] of the Council of Trent stipulated that art was to be direct and compelling in its narrative presentation, that it was to provide an accurate presentation of the biblical narrative or saint’s life, rather than adding incidental and imaginary moments, and that it was to encourage [[piety]]",&lt;ref&gt;''Art in Renaissance Italy.'' Paoletti, John T., and Gary M. Radke. Pg. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact the actual decrees of the council were far less explicit than this, though all of these points were probably in line with their intentions. The very short passage dealing with art came only in the final session in 1563, as a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft. The decree confirmed the traditional doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person themself, not the image, and further instructed that:&lt;blockquote&gt; ...every superstition shall be removed ... all lasciviousness be avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting to lust... there be nothing seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing that is profane, nothing indecorous, seeing that holiness becometh the house of God.

And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Synod ordains, that no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image, in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except that image have been approved of by the bishop ...&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of decorative treatments of religious subjects declined sharply, as did "unbecomingly or confusedly arranged" Mannerist pieces, as a number of books, notably by the Flemish theologian [[Molanus]], Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and Cardinal [[Gabriele Paleotti]], and instructions by local bishops, amplified the decrees, often going into minute detail on what was acceptable.  Many traditional iconographies considered without adequate scriptural foundation were in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art, and almost all nudity, including that of the infant Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450-1660'', chapter VIII, especially pp. 107-128, 1940 (refs to 1985 edn), [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-19-881050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the great medievalist [[Émile Mâle]], this was "the death of medieval art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://danielmitsui.tripod.com/aaaaa/deathart.html The death of Medieval Art]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Extract from book by [[Émile Mâle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art and the Counter-Reformation ==
[[File:Lamentation Scipione Pulzone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s ''[[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]]'', a typical Counter-Reformation work.]]

While Calvinists largely removed public art from religion and Reformed societies moved towards more "secular" forms of art which might be said to glorify God through the portrayal of the "natural beauty of His creation and by depicting people who were created in His image",&lt;ref&gt;''Art of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Nosotro, Rit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-Reformation]] Catholic church continued to encourage religious art, but insisted it was strictly religious in content,  glorifying God and Catholic traditions, including the [[sacraments]] and the [[saints]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of the Counter Reformation.'' [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, "Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere."&lt;ref name="Lamport"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781442271593|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between Lutheran and Roman Catholic places of worship was the presence of the [[tabernacle]] in the latter.&lt;ref name="Lamport"/&gt;

[[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]], who invented the term ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'', cautions against connecting this more austere style in religious painting, which spread from Rome from about 1550, too directly with the decrees of Trent, as it pre-dates these by several years. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;(Sidney) Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s (1550–1598) painting of the [[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]] which was commissioned for the [[Church of the Gesù]] in 1589 is a ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'' work that gives a clear demonstration of what the holy council was striving for in the new style of religious art. With the focus of the painting giving direct attention to the crucifixion of Christ, it complies with the religious content of the council and shows the story of the passion while keeping Christ in the image of the ideal human.

[[File:Paolo Veronese.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Last Supper ([[The Feast in the House of Levi]])'']]
Ten years after the Council of Trent's decree [[Paolo Veronese]] was summoned by the [[Inquisition]] to explain why his ''Last Supper'', a huge canvas for the [[refectory]] of a monastery, contained, in the words of the Inquisition: "buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities" as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast.&lt;ref name="Transcript of Veronese's testimony"&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/Veronese.html Transcript of Veronese's testimony]&lt;/ref&gt;  Veronese was told that he must change his indecorous painting within a three-month period - in fact he just changed the title to ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'', still an episode from the Gospels, but a less doctrinally central one, and no more was said.&lt;ref name="David Rostand 1997"&gt;David Rostand, ''Painting in Sixteenth-Century Venice: Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto'', 2nd ed 1997, Cambridge UP {{ISBN|0-521-56568-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt any Protestant authorities would have been equally disapproving.  The pre-existing decline in "[[donor portrait]]s" (those who had paid for an altarpiece or other painting being placed within the painting) was also accelerated; these become rare after the Council.

[[File:Las lagrimas de san Pedro El Greco 1580.jpg|thumb|240px|''Repentance of Peter'' by [[El Greco]], 1580–1586.]]
Further waves of "Counter-Reformation art" occurred when areas formerly Protestant were again brought under Catholic rule. The churches were normally empty of images, and such periods could represent a boom time for artists. The best known example is the new [[Spanish Netherlands]] (essentially modern [[Belgium]]), which had been the centre of Protestantism in the Netherlands but became (initially) exclusively Catholic after the Spanish drove the Protestants to the north, where they established the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  [[Rubens]] was one of a number of [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque painters]] who received many commissions, and produced several of his best known works re-filling the empty churches.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  Several cities in France in the [[French wars of religion]] and in Germany, [[Bohemia]] and elsewhere in the [[Thirty Years War]] saw similar bursts of restocking.

The rather extreme pronouncement by a synod in [[Antwerp]] in 1610 that in future the central panels of altarpieces should only show New Testament scenes was certainly ignored in the cases of many paintings by [[Rubens]] and other Flemish artists (and in particular the [[Jesuits]] continued to commission altarpieces centred on their saints, but nonetheless New Testament subjects probably did increase.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  Altarpieces became larger and more easy to make out from a distance, and the large painted or gilded carved wooden altarpieces that were the pride of many northern late medieval cities were often replaced with paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subjects were given increased prominence to reflect Counter-Reformation emphases. The ''[[Repentance of Peter]]'', showing the end of the episode of the ''[[Denial of Peter]]'', was not often seen before the Counter-Reformation, when it became popular as an assertion of the [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] against Protestant attacks.  This  followed an influential book by the [[Jesuit]] Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine]] (1542–1621).   The image typically shows Peter in tears, as a half-length portrait with no other figures, often with hands clasped as at right, and sometimes "the [[rooster|cock]]" in the background; it was often coupled with a repentant [[Mary Magdalen]], another exemplar from Bellarmine's book.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, pp. 10 and 315&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Counter-Reformation grew stronger and the Catholic Church felt less threat from the Protestant Reformation, [[Rome]] once again began to assert its [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] to other nations around the world. The religious order of the [[Jesuits]] or the Society of Jesus, sent missionaries to the [[Americas]], parts of [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[eastern Asia]] and used the arts as an effective means of articulating their message of the Catholic Church's dominance over the Christian [[faith]]. The Jesuits' impact was so profound during their missions of the time that today very similar styles of art from the Counter-Reformation period in Catholic Churches are found all over the world.

Despite the differences in approaches to religious art, stylistic developments passed about as quickly across religious divisions as within the two "blocs".  Artistically Rome remained in closer touch with the Netherlands than with Spain.

[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|right|Banner of Peace sign]]

The '''banner of peace''' is a symbol of the [[Roerich Pact]]. This pact is the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscbs.org/1935-roerich-pact.html Roerich Pact: Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by [[Nicholas Roerich]] for an international pact for the protection of culture values.

== Description ==
Roerich described the sign thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[the] proposed banner is the symbol of whole world, not a country, but the whole civilized world. The Banner proposed has on the white background three united amaranth spheres as a symbol of Eternity and Unity. Although we don't know when this Banner will fly over all cultural monuments but undoubtedly the seed has been sprouted. Already it attracts the attention of great intellects and is directed from one heart to another, awaking the idea of Peace and Benevolence among peoples."&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;"Banner of Peace." ''Collected articles''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, 1995. P. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are asked to collect where the signs of our Banner of Peace are. The sign of trinity is found scattered around the whole world. Now anybody can explain it by various ways. One says that it is the past, present and future united by the circle of eternity. Others explain it as a religion, knowledge and art in the circle of culture."&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The following description of the sign appears in the official text of the pact:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/325-480004?OpenDocument Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments (Roerich Pact). Washington, 15 April 1935. Art. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In order to identify the monuments and institutions mentioned in article I, use may be made of a distinctive flag (red circle with a triple red sphere in the circle on a white background) in accordance with the model attached to this treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin ==
In the text of the pact, Roerich wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Banner of Peace, as is now well-known, is the symbol of the Roerich Pact. This great humanitarian ideal provides in the field of mankind's cultural achievements the same guardianship as the Red Cross provides in alleviating the physical sufferings of man."&lt;ref&gt;"Aims and History." ''The Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The origin of Roerich's idea for the creation of the Banner of Peace sign was an ancient [[Russian icon]] by [[Andrei Rublev]]. Roerich wrote about this in his letter to Baron M.A. Taube: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"At last I can send you a home photo of my last picture dedicated to meaning sense of the banner sign. You can show this photo to some committee members and also to anybody whom, as you believe, it may be useful. Say to all ignoramuses which try to substitute their self-interested and ill-intentioned explanations of the sense of this picture. What may be more ancient and more genuine than Byzantine conception which stretches in the depth of centuries to the origin united Christianity and so beautifully implemented in Rublev's icon "Saint life-giving Trinity" from the Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra? Just this symbol – the symbol of ancient Christianity, consecrated for us by name of St. Sergius, gives me a hint to our sign. Its sense is expressed on the proposed photo with conservation of all elements and their positions according to the Rublev's icon. Let this photo will be with You at Paris in the case of any new attempts to destroy already existing. In addition, I send You a photo of St. Queen of the Banner – Madonna Oriflamma." (Letter from N.K. Roerich to Baron M. Taube, 13.02.1932.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

N.K. Roerich has adduced the following illustrations of presence of the Banner of Peace components in the pictures and icons of great spiritual devotees from various religions:{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our post from various countries today brings us much news about the propagation of our Pact for protection of cultural values. We have received a copy of an ancient icon of St Nicholas the Miracle-Worker &lt;…&gt;, which is confirmed to printing by metropolitan Antony. From other regions we have received a photo of an edition of Kiev-Pecherskaya Laura press from 1860 of the service to Venerable Sergius of Radonezh, the Miracle-Worker. From Spain we have received a picture of St. Domingo from "Silos" (archaeological museum, Madrid). Also from Spain we have received a picture of St. Michael made by Bartolommeo Vermekho (1440). At all these pictures the sign of Banner of Peace can be seen. It is useful to remember this for many."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "Half century."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sign of the banner was also found at the Temple of Heaven.  "Tamga" of Tamerlane consists of the same sign. The sign of Three Treasures is well known for many countries of the East. On the chest of Tibetan women one can see a large fibula which is the sign. The same fibulas we see also in Caucasian findings and in Scandinavia. Madonna of Strasbourg has the same sign as well as the Spanish Saints. The same sign is on the icons of St. Sergius and St. Nicholas Miracle-Worker. The sign as a large breast fibula is depicted on Christ's breast on the well-known H. Memling's picture. When we go over sacramental pictures of Byzantine, Roma, the same symbol ties the sacramental pictures on over the world."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "The signs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Conditions of using the banner of peace sign ==
The monuments and institutions, on which the banner of peace sign is proposed to establish, must be included by National governments in the special list. 

'''ARTICLE IV'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The signatory Governments and those which accede to this treaty, shall send to the Pan American Union, at the time of signature or accession, or at any time thereafter, a list of the monuments and institutions for which they desire the protection agreed to in this treaty. The Pan American Union, when notifying the Governments of signatures or accessions, shall also send the list of monuments and institutions mentioned in this article, and shall inform the other Governments of any changes in said list.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

'''ARTICLE V'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The monuments and institutions mentioned in article I shall cease to enjoy the privileges recognized in the present treaty in case they are made use of for military purposes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Roerich wrote about these conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Institutions, collections and missions, registered under [[Roerich Pact]], exhibit a distinctive flag which gives them the right to special protection and respect from belligerent countries and peoples of all countries participating in the treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

It is seen from above words that in order to get the right for exhibition of the distinctive banner one must be registered by Pact bodies. The same standing exists concerning a distinctive banner of [[Red Cross]] (which also created on the basis of ancient symbol – cross).

== Important cultural events with the Banner of Peace ==
In 1990, Russian cosmonauts [[Aleksandr Nikolayevich Balandin|Aleksandr Balandin]] and [[Anatoly Solovyev]] performed a space flight on orbital station [[Mir]] with the banner of peace on board. [[Mir EO-6|This flight]] lasted from February to August, including nine days with the banner outside the craft, completing 144 orbits of the Earth.&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;{{cite web| title= Banner of Peace hall |url= http://en.icr.su/museum/layout/banner/03.php |publisher= International Centre of the Roerichs |accessdate= 3 November 2017 |page= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international scientific "banner of peace" project was conducted in 1997, with the banner of peace again delivered into the orbiting Mir. The aim of this action was to call for protecting life and beauty on Earth. Many international crews worked in Mir with the banner aboard. Cosmonaut Paul Vinogradov, a participant of the project, said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have raised the banner of peace over the Earth in order that a space of culture excludes the space of war and animosity forever. We call all the peoples and nations to building of new spiritual, scientific and artistic cooperation."&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After completing the project and returning from orbit, the banner of peace was passed to the International Centre of the Roerichs. It is now exhibited there. 

On January 5, 1999, the banner of peace was presented to President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. Space pilot A.A. Leonov and professor S.P. Kapitsa participated in the ceremony, which was conducted in the Presidential Palace in [[Almaty]].&lt;ref&gt;"Museum named after N.K. Roerich." ''Museum guide''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. P. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mountaineering|Mountaineers]] have lifted the banner of peace over many mountain peaks. Among these are the following:
: - [[Elbrus]];&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;Presentation of Banner of Peace to President of Kazakh Republic N.A.Nazarbayev. (shorthand record). / Journal “New Epoch. Problems. Searches. Studies” N 2(21), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
: - [[Belukha]], Roerich peak, Urusvati peak, Svetoslav Roerich peak (Altai);&lt;ref name="r9" /&gt;
: - [[Khan Tengri|Khan-Tengri]] (Middle Asia) ;
: - [[Everest]] ([[Himalayas]])

The banner of peace was first raised at the [[North Pole]] by the famous traveler [[Fyodor Konyukhov]] in 1988.  In 1999, participants of the first international complex Antarctic expedition "Towards to XXI" raised the banner of peace at the [[South Pole]]. The banners from these expeditions are now exhibited in the International Centre of the Roerichs.&lt;ref name="r7" /&gt;

In October, 2004 during the celebration of Roerich's 100th anniversary, the banner of peace which had been to the space station was presented to the Indian Parliament. Taking the banner, Speaker S. Chatterji said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It will be kept in the library of Indian Parliament as most precious treasure."&lt;ref&gt;Martovitskaya, M. "Banner of Peace on the earth, in mountains and at the orbit". ''Culture'', No. 14, April 14–20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Biblical studies''' is the academic application of a set of diverse [[Discipline (specialism)|disciplines]] to the study of the [[Bible]] (the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]] and the [[New Testament]]).&lt;ref name=Oxf17/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steve11&gt;''Introduction to Biblical Studies, Second Edition'' by Steve Moyise (Oct 27, 2004) {{ISBN|0567083977}} pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; For its theory and methods, the field draws on disciplines ranging from [[archaeology]], [[ancient history]], cultural backgrounds, [[textual criticism]], [[literary criticism]], historical backgrounds, [[philology]], and [[social science]].&lt;ref name=Oxf17/&gt;

Many secular as well as religious universities and colleges offer courses in biblical studies, usually in departments of [[religious studies]], [[theology]], [[Judaic studies]], history, or [[comparative literature]]. Biblical scholars do not necessarily have a [[faith]] commitment to the texts they study, but many do.

==Definition==
The ''Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies'' defines the field as a set of various, and in some cases independent disciplines for the study of the collection of ancient texts generally known as the Bible.&lt;ref name=Oxf17&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies'' by J. W. Rogerson and Judith M. Lieu (May 18, 2006) {{ISBN|0199254257}} page xvii&lt;/ref&gt; These disciplines include but are not limited to [[archaeology]], [[Egyptology]], [[textual criticism]], [[linguistics]], [[history]], [[sociology]] and [[theology]]&lt;ref name=Oxf17/&gt;, [[patristics#Key persons|patristics]] and related [[Thomism#Thomistic philosophy|thomistic philosophy]].

==Academic societies==
Several academic associations and societies promote research in the field. The largest is the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] (SBL) with around 8,500 members in more than 80 countries. It publishes many books and journals in the biblical studies, including its flagship, the [[Journal of Biblical Literature]]. SBL hosts one academic conference in North America and another international conference each year, as well as smaller regional meetings.

==Biblical criticism==
{{main article|Biblical criticism}}
Biblical criticism is the scholarly "study and investigation of biblical writings that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings".&lt;ref name="harpers"&gt;[[Harper's Bible Dictionary]], 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing biblical texts as being ordinary pieces of literature, rather than set apart from other literature, as in the traditional view, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey. It will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Old Testament]], the letters of [[New Testament]] or the [[canonical gospels]]. It also plays an important role in the quest for a [[historical Jesus]].

It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including [[Biblical archaeology|archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[folklore]], linguistics, [[Christian Oral Tradition|Oral Tradition]] studies, and historical and religious studies.

==Textual criticism==
{{Main|Textual criticism}}
Textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification and removal of transcription errors in texts, both manuscripts and printed books. Ancient scribes made errors or alterations when copying manuscripts by hand. Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic seeks to reconstruct the original text (the [[Urtext (Biblical studies)|urtext]], [[Archetype (textual criticism)|archetype]] or [[autograph]]) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate editions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history. The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work is the production of a "critical edition" containing a text most closely approximating the original.

There are three fundamental approaches to textual criticism: eclecticism, stemmatics, and copy-text editing. Techniques from the biological discipline of cladistics are currently also being used to determine the relationships between manuscripts.

The phrase "lower criticism" is used to describe the contrast between textual criticism and "[[Historical criticism|higher criticism]]", which is the endeavor to establish the authorship, date, and place of composition of the original text.

==History of the Bible==
Historical research has often dominated modern biblical studies. Biblical scholars usually try to interpret a particular text within its original historical context and use whatever information is available to reconstruct that setting. [[Historical criticism]] aims to determine the [[provenance]], authorship, and process by which ancient texts were composed. Famous theories of historical criticism include the [[documentary hypothesis]], which suggests that the [[Pentateuch]] was compiled from four different written sources, and different reconstructions of "the historical Jesus", which are based primarily on the differences between the canonical Gospels.

==Original languages==
Most of the Hebrew Bible, the [[Tanakh]], which is the basis of the Christian [[Old Testament]], was written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], though a few chapters were written in [[Biblical Aramaic]]. The [[New Testament]] was written in [[Koine Greek]], with possible [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic undertones]], as was the first translation of the Hebrew Bible known as the [[Septuagint]] or Greek Old Testament. Therefore, Hebrew, Greek and sometimes Aramaic continue to be taught in most universities, colleges and seminaries with strong programs in biblical studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">'''Bioclimatology''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of science that studies the interactions between the [[biosphere]] and the [[Earth's atmosphere]] on time scales of the order of seasons or longer (by opposition to [[biometeorology]]).

==Examples of relevant processes==

[[Climate]] processes largely control the distribution, size, shape and properties of living organisms on [[Earth]]. For instance, the general circulation of the atmosphere on a planetary scale broadly determines the location of large [[desert]]s or the regions subject to frequent [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], which, in turn, greatly determine which organisms can naturally survive in these environments. Furthermore, changes in climates, whether due to natural processes or to human interferences, may progressively modify these [[Habitat (ecology)|habitats]] and cause [[overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]] or [[extinction]] of indigenous species.

The biosphere, for its part, and in particular continental [[vegetation]], which constitutes over 99% of the total [[biomass]], has played a critical role in establishing and maintaining the chemical composition of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], especially during the early evolution of the planet (See [[History of Earth]] for more details on this topic). Currently, the terrestrial vegetation exchanges some 60 billion tons of [[carbon]] with the atmosphere on an annual basis (through processes of [[carbon fixation]] and [[carbon respiration]]), thereby playing a critical role in the [[carbon cycle]]. On a global and annual basis, small imbalances between these two major fluxes, as do occur through changes in [[land cover]] and [[land use]], contribute to the current increase in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]].

'''Caucasology''', or '''Caucasiology''' refers to the [[history|historical]] and [[geopolitical]] studies of [[Caucasus]] region. The branch has more than 150 years history. In 1972, the Caucasiological Center (renamed to International Caucasiological Center in 2000) was founded under the auspices of the [[Israel President]] [[Zalman Shazar]].

'''Communication design''' is a mixed discipline between [[design]] and information-development which is concerned with how [[media (communication)|media]] intervention such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Some designers use [[graphic design]] and communication design interchangeably due to overlapping skills.

Communication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the people one are focusing one's skills on. Design skills must be tailored to fit to different cultures of people, while maintaining pleasurable visual design. These are all important pieces of information to add to a media communications kit to get the best results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413032136/http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discipline of Communication, a framework for Communication as Design has emerged that focuses on redesigning interactivity and shaping communication [[Affordance|affordances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aakhus|first=Mark|date=2007-03-01|title=Communication as Design|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637750701196383|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=74|issue=1|pages=112–117|doi=10.1080/03637750701196383|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software and applications create opportunities for and place constraints on communication. Recently, Guth and Brabham examined the way that ideas compete within a [[crowdsourcing]] platform, providing a model about the relationships among design ideas, communication, and platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guth|first=Kristen L.|last2=Brabham|first2=Daren C.|date=2017-08-04|title=Finding the diamond in the rough: Exploring communication and platform in crowdsourcing performance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors have interviewed technology company founders about the democratic ideals they build into the design of [[e-government]] applications and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the Communication as Design framework is growing among researchers. 

==Overview==
Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, using [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]]. Communications designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. Their particular talent lies not only in the traditional skills of the hand, but also in their ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms, in order to establish credibility through the communication.

The term communication design is often used interchangeably with [[visual communication]], but has an alternative broader meaning that includes [[Auditory system|auditory]], vocal, touch and smell. Examples of communication design include [[information architecture]], [[editing]], [[typography]], [[illustration]], [[web design]], [[animation]], [[advertising]], [[ambient media]], [[Brand management|visual identity design]], [[performing arts]], [[copywriting]] and [[professional writing]] skills applied in the [[creative industries]].

==Education==
Students of communication design learn how to create visual messages and broadcast them to the world in new and meaningful ways. In the complex [[digital environment]] around us, communication design has become a powerful means of reaching out to the [[target audience]]. Students learn how to combine communication with [[art]] and [[technology]]. Communication Design discipline involves teaching how to design [[Web page|web pages]], [[Video game|video games]], [[animation]], [[motion graphics]] and more.

Communication Design has content as its main purpose. It must achieve a reaction, or get customer to see a product in a genuine way to attract sales or get across a message. Students of Communications Design are often Illustrators, Graphic Designers, Web designers, Advertising artists, Animators, Video Editors or Motion graphic artists, or even printmakers and conceptual artists. The term Communications Design is fairly general and practitioners work in various mediums to get a message across.

===Visual design===

'''Visual design''' is the [[design]] working in any media or support of [[visual communication]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Munari|MUNARI, Bruno]]. '''Design and visual communication'''.

'''Content and language integrated learning''' ('''CLIL''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/clil British Council BBC Teaching English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson &amp; McKinley|title=Integration of content and language learning|journal=TESOL Encyclopedia of English Language Teaching|date=Feb 2018|volume=1|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/integration_of_content_and_langauge_tesol_encyclopedia_author_version.pdf|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach for learning content through an additional language (foreign or second), thus teaching both the subject and the language. 

==CLIL origin==
The term '''CLIL''' was created in 1994 by  [http://clil-cd.ecml.at/Team/Teammember4/tabid/941/language/en-GB/Default.aspx David Marsh] as a methodology similar to but distinct from [[language immersion]] and [[content-based instruction]]. The idea of its proponents was to create an "umbrella term" which encompasses different forms of using language as the medium of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onestopenglish.com/clil/what-is-clil/ | title=What is CLIL? | work=Onestopenglish | accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology has been applied in a business context in many countries and widely accepted as an effective approach. In Italy for example, it is being used as an accelerated method to teach management concepts in English to business people. Among CLIL's proponents and practitioners there is Dr Maurizio Morselli, a Human Resources professional and Executive Coach, who believes that "this hybrid immersion approach produces a lot more immediate results and it appeals to self-motivated adult audiences who possess a basic knowledge and understanding of the target language".

==CLIL and language immersion==
CLIL is fundamentally based on methodological principles established by research on [[language immersion]]. This kind of approach has been identified as very important by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2003:0449:FIN:EN:PDF Commission Of The European Communities Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: An Action Plan 2004 – 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; because: "It can provide effective opportunities for pupils to use their new language skills now, rather than learn them now for use later. It opens doors on languages for a broader range of learners, nurturing self-confidence in young learners and those who have not responded well to formal language instruction in general education. It provides exposure to the language without requiring extra time in the curriculum, which can be of particular interest in vocational settings." This approach involves learning subjects such as history, geography, managerial skills/concepts or others, through an additional language. It can be very successful in enhancing the learning of languages and other subjects, and helping children develop a positive attitude towards themselves as language learners. 

The European Commission has therefore decided to promote the training of teachers to "...enhancing the language competences in general, in order to promote the teaching of non-linguistic subjects in foreign languages".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:320:0001:0003:EN:PDF Journal of the European Union Council Resolution of 21 November 2008 on a European strategy for multilingualism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An educational project called [http://e-clil.uws.ac.uk/ ECLIL] was also supported from the European Union within the [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/index_en.php Lifelong Learning Programme EACEA Agency], to develop interactive resources for European schools.&lt;/ref&gt;

==CLIL objectives==
CLIL objectives are varied, but among the most relevant ones the following can be pointed out (Coyle et al., 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Coyle, D., Hood, P. &amp; Marsh, D. (2010). CLIL. Cambridge: C.U.P.&lt;/ref&gt;: To improve the educational system. To establish the necessary conditions that will allow students to achieve the appropriate level of academic performance in CLIL subjects. To improve students’ proficiency in both their mother tongue and the target language, attaching the same importance to each. To develop the intercultural understanding. To develop social and thinking skills.

CLIL advocates claim that this educational approach (Lorenzo et al., 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, F., Trujillo, F. &amp; Vez, M. (2011). Educación bilingüe. Integración de contenidos y segundas lenguas. Madrid: Síntesis.&lt;/ref&gt;: Improves L1 and L2 development. Prepares students for the globalized world. Increases students’ motivation to learn foreign languages. Promotes the learning of a more extensive and varied vocabulary. Enhances students’ confidence in the target language. Improves language competence in the target language, CLIL being more beneficial that traditional foreign language teaching courses. Helps develop intercultural competence.

==CLIL in English as an international language==
The integration of content and language learning in [[international English|English as an international language]] (EIL) is found in approaches to [[bilingual education]].&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches include [[language immersion|immersion]], [[content-based instruction]] (CBI), content-based language teaching (CBLT), and the movement towards [[English-medium education|English medium instruction]] (EMI). All of these approaches raise a number of questions that a view of English as an international language has for content-integrated approaches (Thompson &amp; McKinley, 2018).&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplicity of terms===
The multiplicity of terms used to refer to instructional approaches for the integration of content and language learning (immersion, CBI, CBLT, CLIL, EMI) can be a source of confusion in EIL studies, although they all commonly share the purpose of additive bilingualism via a dual focus on content and language learning. Debate continues about the extent to which immersion, CBLT, CBI, and CLIL are different, similar, or the same. Some argue that CLIL represents an appropriate umbrella term that can be used to house various approaches towards content integration (e.g., immersion is a type of CLIL), where terms can be used interchangeably (e.g., CLIL and CBI are the same concept with a different name) (Cenoz et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cenoz, Gennessee &amp; Gorter|title=Critical analysis of CLIL: Taking stock and looking forward.|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2014|volume=35|issue=3|pages=243-262}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that CLIL and CBI represent very different concepts, where CLIL represents the intersection between content and language from the content perspective (i.e., CLIL happens in content classes), while CBI is an attempt at responding to the content needs of learners in language classes (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton-Puffer, Llinares, Lorenzo &amp; Nikula|title=“You can stand under my umbrella”: Immersion, clil and bilingual education. A response to Cenoz, Genesee &amp; Gorter (2013).|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2014|volume=35|issue=2|pages=213-218}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The similarities (and variability) between approaches lead to circular arguments about whether the key features of one approach are also shared by others (e.g., immersion and CLIL), and therefore they are indistinguishable. In some ways, this is an inevitable result of terms being used outside of academia, by educators applying ideas from one context to another,&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the lines of demarcation become more unclear as approaches are transported to different countries and contextualized to meet different learning situations.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In EIL studies, different terms have been associated with different regions, such as CLIL, which is associated with Europe, and was “purposefully coined” by European educators and researchers attempting to influence language policy and ideology (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014:214).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; CLIL represented a deliberate attempt to develop a European model for additive bilingual education.&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[policy-maker|policy makers]], educators, and researchers from international contexts have started to apply and develop CLIL approaches in distinctly non-European situations, and the term is now widely used within the wider international foreign language learning community.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13235">The '''destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts''' became publicly known on February 26, 2015 when the group known as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] released a video showing their destruction.

==Mosul Museum==
The [[Mosul Museum]], opened in 1952, is the second largest museum in Iraq, with the first being the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. The museum is split into four areas of focus: The Assyrian hall, the Hatrene hall, the Islamic hall, and the Prehistoric hall.

===Importance of the region===
Iraq's present day borders overlap with the historic extent of [[Mesopotamia]]. Mesopotamia is considered to be one of the first areas in which urbanization evolved, beginning around the 4th millennia B.C. The "city" became the center of the new social system, resulting in the need of centralized power.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, the land of Iraq holds evidence of the switch from stylized and schematic figures to more realistic representations of the human form. Writing evolved during this time period as well, allowing people to describe divine figures and conceptualize religion.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological efforts uncovered evidence of Mesopotamia as a world contemporary with the Bible, with many stories on cuneiform tablets describing versions of similar biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 22) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's understanding of Iraq and its history comes from the archaeological efforts that have taken place on its land. Because of a lack of visible architectural remains in the area, Mesopotamia, and Iraq in particular, are where the "treasure hunting" of old transformed into the beginnings of  the real archaeological research we know today. Archaeologists have been researching in Iraq for over a century and a half, lending us a great amount of time to truly understand the region's impact on those who live there and ultimately, the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction (2015)==

===Contents of ISIL video===
In a video shared on February 26, 2015, ISIL entered the Mosul Museum with the purpose of destroying artifacts they deemed "idolatrous". Members of the group can be seen pushing over many statues, while using jackhammers and sledgehammers to damage the faces of others. A spokesperson appears in the beginning of the video, explaining the rationale behind the group's actions. The rationale pertains to the assumption that these objects (statues, figurines, etc.) were once worshiped instead of Allah.

A translation from the video is as follows: "These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The so-called Assyrians and Akkadians and others looked to gods for war, agriculture and rain to whom they offered sacrifices…The Prophet Mohammed took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries." &lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage===
Not all of the museum's collection was damaged by ISIL. However, the most impacted were the Assyrian and Hatrene areas of the museum. The Islamic hall, which still held many priceless antiquities, was not shown in the video. The Prehistoric hall was also never shown, though most of those artifacts had been removed prior to the destruction.

====Assyrian====
*Nergal Gate: The Nergal Gate is located on the north side of [[Nineveh]], an ancient Mesopotamian city located in present-day Mosul. The gate was built sometime between 704 and 690 BC, which was a time of expansion for Nineveh under the ruler [[Sennacherib]]. The gate is related to the ancient Mesopotamian god [[Nergal]], who was associated with the summer solstice, war, destruction, and the netherworld.   
*Lamassu: At the Nergal Gate's entrance, and just within the entrance, stand the [[lamassu]]. These mythological figures first began appearing in art and architecture during the first half of the second millennium B.C., and are described as large winged human-headed bulls. Aside from being decoration, the lamassu are protective figures, more specifically described as "a benevolent spirit attached to an individual, group, a place or an entrance." The lamassu erected at the entrance of the Nergal Gate at Nineveh are surrounded by relief sculpture that depicts the stages of transport of the human-headed bulls from quarries in Balatai.&lt;ref&gt;[Danrey, V. (2004). Winged Human-Headed Bulls of Ninevah: Genesis of an Iconographic Motif. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale. Vol. 66, Ninevah.]&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 13 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + -Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's) &amp; Full Projection.2.JPG|thumb|Lamassu and Balawat Gate in the British Museum]]

Before the release of the ISIL video on February 26, 2015, the lamassu were in various states of preservation. Of the two figures at the entrance of the gate, one still had its upper portion preserved. The video shows an ISIL member jackhammering face of the lamassu at the right side of the gate. The left one was probably untouched, as it has been missing its upper portion since the late 19th century. The ones located inside the gates were less well-preserved than their counterparts at the entrance. However, both were seen being damaged by jackhammers and sledgehammers. The Assyrian section within the Mosul Museum also holds other lamassu of an earlier style. These may also have become damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balawat Gates====
The Mosul Museum holds in its collection numerous bronze bands of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The bands are decorated with scenes of Assyrian war, hunt, and tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[J.E. Curtis &amp; N. Tallis. (2009). The Balawat gates of Ashurnasirpal II. In ''Journal of the American Oriental Society''. American Oriental Society. Vol. 129, No. 3. pp. 552-554.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Balawat Gates are of archaeological and historical significance because they are considered a "'major' find from a 'minor'" site.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt; Tell-Balawat, the site from which the Balawat Gates originate, was considered a small site in comparison to the neighboring Assyrian sites of Nineveh and Nimrud. Through further research, Tell-Balawat (also known as the city of Igmur-Enlil), was found to be within a "hollow-way" between Nineveh and Nimrud, suggesting that its purpose included defending these two cities.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The displayed bands are shown on ISIL's video, but it is unknown whether they were destroyed at that time. Because the Mosul Museum was previously looted in 2003, some of the bands were already missing. Since the bands are considered portable, it is assumed that some were sold on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum holds a second pair of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Shalmaneser III. These are well documented, and can be used to aid in the identification of the Ashurnasirpal's bands if they arise.

====Hatrene statues====
Hatra was an ancient city located between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, to the south of present-day Mosul. Its significance is great, as its historical and archaeological record indicate it was a wealthy trading city, influenced heavily by its neighboring peoples and empires. Hatra's artworks are of interest to scholars because they have been analyzed as hybrids of artistic styles from the West and East of the city. For example, a Hatrene statue of a seated goddess is described as having drapery consistent with Buddhist style, while also having the large, protruding eyes typical of Mesopotamian works.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. Said (1972). Hatra, Iraq. In ''Archaeology''. Archaeological Institute of America. Vol. 25, No. 2. pp. 103-111.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hercules Hatra Iraq Parthian period 1st 2nd century CE.jpg|thumb|Hatrene statue of Hercules]]

The Mosul Museum was home to a variety of Hatra's sculptures. Most of the sculptures were images of Hatrene kings or noblemen. The ISIL video shows many of these sculptures being hit with sledgehammers and toppled to the ground. Of the 27 known Hatrene sculptures of kings, 4 were seen damaged in the ISIL video. This represents a 15% loss of these sculptures that are known to be in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-2-the-sculptures-from-hatra/ Assessing the Damange at the Mosul Museum, Part 2: The Sculptures from Hatra]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Questioned authenticity of damaged artifacts====
According to Iraqi archaeologists, some of the collection belonging to the Mosul Museum was moved to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad six months prior to the release of the ISIL video. This spared many priceless artifacts from becoming damaged. Additionally, sources have suggested that a portion of the artifacts shown being damaged in the video were in fact reproductions or reconstructions. However, Iraqi archaeologists state this may not be the case entirely. Some artworks known to have been genuine were not shown in the video, leading archaeologists to believe that the portable objects were looted, while larger, non-portable objects were the only ones to be damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/full-story-isil-takeover-mosul-museum-150309053022129.html/ The full story behind ISIL's takeover of Mosul Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===

The 2003 looting of the National Museum of Iraq showed the cultural heritage community the extreme importance of documentation within a museum or archaeological setting. The National Museum of Iraq lacked a complete inventory, which includes photographs of all objects. The problem became exacerbated when salvaged archaeological materials came into the museum in the late 1990s until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The influx of artifacts made it very difficult for the staff to keep up with its documentation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajaonline.org/online-review-museum/364 Learning from the Iraq Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://professorhistoryx.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/what-isis-destroys-why-and-why-we-must-document-it-hyperallergic/ What ISIS Destroys, Why, and Why We Must Document It]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mosul Museum may be in this same situation, though information on its documentation processes has not come to light. If photographs of their artifacts are in existence, they will be useful in identifying and recovering the looted artifacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4734">'''[[Ecological]] [[goods and services]]''' ('''EG&amp;S''') are the benefits arising from the ecological functions of [[ecosystems]]. Such benefits accrue to all [[Organism|living organisms]], including animals and plants, rather than to humans alone. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance to society that ecological goods and services provide for health, social, cultural, and economic needs. 

==Introduction==
Examples of ecological goods include [[Air pollution|clean air]], and abundant [[fresh water]]. Examples of ecological services include purification of air and water, maintenance of biodiversity, decomposition of wastes, soil and vegetation generation and renewal, pollination of crops and natural vegetation, groundwater recharge through wetlands, [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], [[greenhouse gas]] mitigation, and aesthetically pleasing landscapes. The products and processes of ecological goods and services are complex and occur over long periods of time. They are a sub-category of [[public goods]].

The concern over ecological goods and services arises because we are losing them at an unsustainable rate, and therefore [[land use]] managers must devise a host of tools to encourage the provision of more ecological goods and services. Rural and suburban settings are especially important, as lands that are developed and converted from their natural state lose their ecological functions. Therefore, ecological goods and services provided by privately held lands become increasingly important.

==Markets==
A market may be created wherein ecological goods and services are demanded by society and supplied by public and private landowners.  Some believe that [[public land]]s alone are not adequate to supply this market, and that privately held lands are needed to close this gap. What has emerged is the notion that rural landowners who provide ecological goods and services to society through good stewardship practices on their land should be duly compensated. The main tool to accomplish this to date has been to pay farmers directly to set-aside portions of their land that would otherwise be in production. This exemplifies a shift in thinking from the "polluter pays" to the "beneficiary pays". 

Financial incentives to landowners is one approach, but provision of EG&amp;S can also be achieved through regulation, stewardship incentives under existing programs such Environmental Farm Plans, [[market-based instruments]], and tax rebates.

==Biodiversity and EGS==
According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110423003943/http://www.maweb.org/en/index.aspx Millennium Ecosystem Assessment] project, [[biodiversity]] is a necessary underlying component of ecological goods and services.  Biodiversity supports ecological goods and services such as [[biological control]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Costanza|Costanza, R.]], d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Limburg, K., Naeem, S., O'Neill, R., Paruelo, J., Raskin, R.G., Sutton, P. &amp; van den Belt, M. (1997). The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''387''':253-260&lt;/ref&gt;  However, biodiversity is also sometimes referred to as an actual ecological good or service which can be confusing.  

==Policy tools==
The following policy tools can be used to ensure production of ecological goods and services:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Quebec)|Agriculture, Pêcheries et Alimentation]], Quebec. (2005). Remuneration for ecological goods and services produced by agriculture: Elements for a Quebec analysis.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in French)

[[File:Discharge pipe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wastewater]] discharge]]
'''Effluent''' is an outflowing of water or gas to a natural body of water, from a structure such as a [[wastewater treatment plant]], [[Sewerage|sewer pipe]], or industrial outfall. Effluent, in engineering, is the stream exiting a [[chemical reactor]].&lt;ref&gt; Scott Fogler, ''Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering'', page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Effluent is defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] as "''wastewater - treated or untreated - that flows out of a treatment plant, sewer, or industrial outfall. Generally refers to wastes discharged into surface waters''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/OCEPAterms/eterms.html |title=Terms of Environment Beginning With "E"    |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-06-09 |date=2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Compact Oxford English Dictionary defines effluent as "''liquid waste or sewage discharged into a river or the sea''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/effluent?view=uk |title=AskOxford: effluent |work=Ask Oxford.com |publisher=Oxford University Press, |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effluent in the artificial sense is in general considered to be [[water pollution]], such as the outflow from a [[sewage treatment]] facility or the [[wastewater]] discharge from industrial facilities. An effluent [[sump pump]], for instance, pumps waste from toilets installed below a main sewage line. Similar to wastewater produced in different establishments, industries, and facilities. These wastewater released can also accumulate and pollute the nearby communities and bodies of water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canencia|first=Oliva P|last2=Dalugdug|first2=Marlou D|last3=Emano|first3=Athena Marie|last4=Mendoza|first4=Richard|last5=Walag|first5=Angelo Mark P.|date=2016-08-31|title=Slaughter waste effluents and river catchment watershed contamination in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307931158_Slaughter_waste_effluents_and_river_catchment_watershed_contamination_in_Cagayan_de_Oro_City_Philippines | journal=ResearchGate | volume=9 | issue=2 | issn=2220-6663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[waste water treatment plants]], effluent that has been treated is sometimes called ''secondary effluent'', or ''treated effluent''.  This cleaner effluent is then used to feed the [[bacteria]] in [[biofilters]].

In the context of a [[thermal power station]], the output of the cooling system may be referred to as the effluent cooling water, which is noticeably warmer than the environment.  Effluent only refers to liquid discharge.  

In [[sugar beet]] processing, effluent is often settled in water tanks that allow the mud-contaminated water to settle. The mud sinks to the bottom, leaving the top section of water clear, free to be pumped back into the river or be reused in the process again.

Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, 1535 pp&lt;/ref&gt;     

Global emissions budgets are calculated according to historical cumulative emissions from fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and land-use change, but vary according to the global temperature target that is chosen, the probability of staying below that target, and the emission of other non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases (GHGs)]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Friedlingstein, P., Andrew, R.

''Nature geoscience'', ''7''(10), 709.&lt;/ref&gt; Global emissions budgets can be further divided into national emissions budgets, so that countries can set specific climate mitigation goals. Emissions budgets are relevant to [[climate change mitigation]] because they indicate a finite amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted over time, before resulting in dangerous levels of global warming. Change in global temperature is independent from the geographic location of these emissions, and is largely independent of the timing of these emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zickfeld|first=K.|last2=Arora|first2=V.

An "emissions target" may be distinguished from an emissions budget, as an emissions target may be internationally or nationally set in accordance with objectives other than a specific global temperature. This includes targets created for their political palatability, rather than ones focused on climate science warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babiker|first=Mustafa H.|last2=Eckaus|first2=Richard S.|date=2002-09-01|title=Rethinking the Kyoto Emissions Targets|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016139500611|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|pages=399–414|doi=10.1023/A:1016139500611|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the pre-industrial period to 2011, approximately 1890 [[Gigatonnes]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has already been emitted globally, and 2050 GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; up to 2015.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Rogelj, J., Schaeffer, M., Friedlingstein, P., Gillett, N.

Alternative to budgets set explicitly using temperature objectives, emissions budgets have also been estimated using the [[Representative Concentration Pathways]], which are based on [[radiative forcing]] values at the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vuuren|first=Detlef P. van|last2=Edmonds|first2=James A.|last3=Kainuma|first3=Mikiko|last4=Riahi|first4=Keywan|last5=Weyant|first5=John|date=2011-11-01|title=A special issue on the RCPs|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0157-y|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=109|issue=1-2|pages=1|doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0157-y|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Although temperatures may be inferred from radiative forcing). These were presented in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|International Panel on Climate Change]] Fifth Assessment report.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== National emissions budgets ==
In light of the many differences between nations, including but not limited to population, level of industrialization, national emissions histories, and mitigation capabilities, scientists have made attempts to allocate global carbon budgets among countries using methods that follow various principles of equity.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Ringius, L., Torvanger, A., &amp; Underdal, A. (2002). Burden sharing and fairness principles in international climate policy. ''International Environmental Agreements'', ''2''(1), 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Allocating national emissions budgets is comparable to sharing the burdens of climate change&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;, underlined by some assumptions of state-level responsibility of climate change. Many authors have conducted quantitative analyses which allocate emissions budgets &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;, often simultaneously addressing disparities in historical GHG emissions between nations. 

One common principle that has been used to allocate global emissions budgets to nations is the "responsibility" or "[[Polluter pays principle|polluter-pays" principle]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This principle recognizes nations' cumulative historical contributions to global emissions. So those countries with greater emissions levels over a set time period (for example, since the pre-industrial era to the present) would be responsible for reducing a greater portion of global emissions. Thus, their national emissions budgets would be smaller than those that have polluted less in the past. The concept of national historical responsibility for climate change has prevailed in the literature since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Grübler, A., &amp; Fujii, Y. (1991). Inter-generational and spatial equity issues of carbon accounts. ''Energy'', ''16''(11-12), 1397-1416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K. R. (1992). Allocating responsibility for global warming: The natural debt index. ''Ambio. Stockholm'', ''20''(2), 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, some have quantified cumulative historical emissions of states, while highlighting the ethical challenges of allocating climate responsibilities according to this principle.&lt;ref&gt;Botzen, W. J., Gowdy, J. M., &amp; van den Bergh, J. C. (2008). Cumulative CO2 emissions: shifting international responsibilities for climate debt. ''Climate policy'', ''8''(6), 569-576. doi:10.3763/cpol.2008.0539.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is often favoured by developing countries, as it gives them larger emissions budgets.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Pan, J. (2003). Emissions rights and their transferability: equity concerns over climate change mitigation. ''International Environmental Agreements'', ''3''(1), 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another common equity principle for calculating national emissions budgets is the "[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian" principle]]. This principle stipulates individuals should have equal rights to pollute, and therefore emissions budgets should be distributed proportionally according to state populations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some scientists have thus reasoned the use of national per-capita emissions in national emissions budget calculations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Baer, P., Athanasiou, T., Kartha, S., &amp; Kemp-Benedict, E. (2009). Greenhouse development rights: A proposal for a fair global climate treaty. ''Ethics place and environment'', ''12''(3), 267-281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=H. Damon|date=January 2016|title=Quantifying historical carbon and climate debts among nations|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2774|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|pages=60–64|doi=10.1038/nclimate2774|issn=1758-6798|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumayer|first=Eric|title=In defence of historical accountability for greenhouse gas emissions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00135-X|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=33|issue=2|pages=185–192|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(00)00135-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle may be favoured by nations with larger or rapidly growing populations.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  

A third equity principle that has been employed in national budget calculations considers national [[Westphalian sovereignty|sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The "sovereignty" principle highlights the equal right of nations to pollute.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The grandfathering method for calculating national emissions budgets uses this principle. Grandfathering allocates these budgets proportionally according to emissions at a particular base year,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and has been used under international regimes such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]]&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (1998). "Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change".(&lt;nowiki&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;) &lt;/ref&gt; and the early phase of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2010) 2010/384/: Commission Decision of 9 July 2010 on the Community-wide quantity of allowances to be issued under the EU Emission Trading Scheme for 2013 (notified under document C(2010) 4658). ''Official Journal of the European Union'' '''L 175''' 36-37 (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0384&lt;/nowiki&gt;) &lt;/ref&gt; This principle is often favoured by developed countries, as it allocates larger emissions budgets to them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor. Barbara King argues that while non-human primates are not religious, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of religion. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for [[symbolic communication]], a sense of social norms, realization of "[[self]]" and a concept of continuity.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, Barbara (2007).

== Relevant prerequisites for human religion ==

===Increased brain size===
In this set of theories, the religious mind is one consequence of a brain that is large enough to formulate religious and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Religious ideas can theoretically be traced to the evolution of brains large enough to make possible the kind of abstract thought necessary to formulate religious and philosophical ideas|authorlink=Paul R. Ehrlich|last=Ehrlich|first=Paul|title=Human Natures: Genes, Cultures, and the Human Prospect |isbn=978-1-55963-779-4|page=214|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mHFsScY8ewMC&amp;pg=PA214|year=2000|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[human evolution]], the hominid brain tripled in size, peaking 500,000 years ago. Much of the brain's expansion took place in the [[neocortex]]. The cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neuronal computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/141/1/11|title=How unique is the human neocortex?|first1=Zoltán|last1=Molnár|first2=Alex|last2=Pollen|date=1 January 2014|journal=Development|volume=141|issue=1|pages=11–16|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=dev.biologists.org|doi=10.1242/dev.101279|pmid=24346696}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dunbar's number|Dunbar's theory]], the relative [[Neocortex#Neocortex ratio|neocortex size]] of any species correlates with the level of social complexity of the particular species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Processing power limits social group size: computational evidence for the cognitive costs of sociality|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20131151|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2013-08-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 3712454|pmid = 23804623|page = 20131151|volume = 280|issue = 1765|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2013.1151|first = T.|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = R. I. M.|last2 = Dunbar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neocortex size correlates with a number of social variables that include social group size and complexity of mating behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bondedness and sociality|journal = Behaviour|date = 2010-06-01|issn = 1568-539X|pages = 775–803|volume = 147|issue = 7|doi = 10.1163/000579510X501151|first = Robin I. M.|last = Dunbar|first2 = Susanne|last2 = Shultz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chimpanzees the neocortex occupies 50% of the brain, whereas in modern humans it occupies 80% of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/88783/9-brainy-facts-about-neocortex|title=9 Brainy Facts About the Neocortex|author=|date=17 November 2016|website=mentalfloss.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robin Dunbar]] argues that the critical event in the evolution of the neocortex took place at the [[speciation]] of [[Archaic humans|archaic homo sapiens]] about 500,000 years ago. His study indicates that only after the speciation event is the neocortex large enough to process complex social phenomena such as language and religion. The study is based on a [[regression analysis]] of neocortex size plotted against a number of social behaviors of living and extinct hominids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |title=THE SOCIAL BRAIN: Mind, Language, and Society in Evolutionary Perspective |last=Dunbar |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Dunbar |year=2003 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=author%3ADunbar+intitle%3ATHE+SOCIAL+BRAIN%3A+Mind%2C+Language%2C+and+Society+in+Evolutionary+Perspective&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2003&amp;as_yhi=2003&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911214723/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests that religion may have grown out of evolutionary changes which favored larger brains as a means of cementing group coherence among savannah hunters, after that larger brain enabled reflection on the inevitability of personal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Jay Gould|author2=Paul McGarr|author3=Steven Peter Russell Rose|title=The richness of life: the essential Stephen Jay Gould|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC|year=2007|publisher=W.

===Tool use===
[[Lewis Wolpert]] argues that causal beliefs that emerged from tool use played a major role in the evolution of belief. The manufacture of complex tools requires creating a mental image of an object which does not exist naturally before actually making the artifact. Furthermore, one must understand how the tool would be used, that requires an understanding of [[causality]].&lt;ref name="wolpert"&gt;{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0|quote=with regard to hafted tools, One would have to understand that the two pieces serve different purposes, and imagine how the tool could be used,| author=Lewis Wolpert| year=2006| publisher=Norton| location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the level of sophistication of stone tools is a useful indicator of causal beliefs.&lt;ref name="wolpert2"&gt;{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|last=Wolpert|first=Lewis|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0| quote= Belief in cause and effect has had the most enormous effect on human evolution, both physical and cultural. Tool use, with language, has transformed human evolution and let to what we now think of as belief|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HP35qPdfioAC&amp;pg=PA82|page=82| year=2006| publisher=Norton| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpert contends use of tools composed of more than one component, such as hand axes, represents an ability to understand cause and effect. However, recent studies of other primates indicate that causality may not be a uniquely human trait. For example, chimpanzees have been known to escape from pens closed with multiple latches, which was previously thought could only have been figured out by humans who understood causality.  Chimpanzees are also known to mourn the dead, and notice things that have only aesthetic value, like sunsets, both of which may be considered to be components of religion or spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/can-an-ape-learn-to-be-human-2332047.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Steve | last=Connor | title=Can an ape learn to be human? | date=August 5, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference between the comprehension of causality by humans and chimpanzees is one of degree. The degree of comprehension in an animal depends upon the size of the prefrontal cortex: the greater the size of the prefrontal cortex the deeper the comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3190564 | pmid=22013351 | doi=10.4103/0973-1229.33001 | volume=6 | issue=1 | title=Neurobiology of spirituality | year=2008 | journal=Mens Sana Monogr | pages=63–80 | last1 = Mohandas | first1 = E}} {{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of language===
{{See also|Origin of language|Myth and religion}}
Religion requires a system of symbolic communication, such as language, to be transmitted from one individual to another. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "human religious thought and moral sense clearly rest on a cognitive-linguistic base".&lt;ref name="lieberman"/&gt; From this premise science writer [[Nicholas Wade]] states: 
:"Like most behaviors that are found in societies throughout the world, religion must have been present in the ancestral human population before the dispersal from Africa 50,000 years ago. Although religious rituals usually involve dance and music, they are also very verbal, since the sacred truths have to be stated. If so, religion, at least in its modern form, cannot pre-date the emergence of language. It has been argued earlier that language attained its modern state shortly before the exodus from Africa. If religion had to await the evolution of modern, articulate language, then it too would have emerged shortly before 50,000 years ago."&lt;ref name="wade"&gt;*"[[Nicholas Wade|Wade, Nicholas]] – ''Before The Dawn, Discovering the lost history of our ancestors''.  Penguin Books, London, 2006.  p. 8 p. 165" {{ISBN|1-59420-079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another view distinguishes individual religious belief from collective religious belief. While the former does not require prior development of language, the latter does. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief. A socially accepted hypothesis becomes dogmatic backed by social sanction.

===Morality and group living===
{{Main|Evolution of morality|Morality#Evolution}}
[[Frans de Waal]] and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality. Although morality awareness may be a unique human trait, many [[social animal]]s, such as primates, dolphins and whales, have been known to exhibit pre-moral sentiments. According to [[Michael Shermer]], the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes:
{{quote|attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that [[pack hunter|hunt in packs]] to take down large or dangerous prey.

All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place. Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of fairness. In a 2008 study, de Waal and colleagues put two capuchin monkeys side by side and gave them a simple task to complete: Giving a rock to the experimenter. They were given cucumbers as a reward for executing the task, and the monkeys obliged. But if one of the monkeys was given grapes, something interesting happened:
After receiving the first piece of cucumber, the capuchin monkey gave the experimenter a rock as expected. But upon seeing that the other monkey got grapes, the capuchin monkey threw away the next piece of cucumber that was given to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/19/health/chimpanzee-fairness-morality/index.html|title=Morality: It's not just for humans - CNN|first=By Elizabeth Landau,|last=CNN|date=|website=cnn.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Chimpanzees live in [[Fission-fusion society|fission-fusion groups]] that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of [[wikt:extant|extant]] hunter-gatherer societies, recent Paleolithic [[hominid]]s lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of social control, conflict resolution and group solidarity. According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Humans enforce their society's moral codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and reputation building. Humans also apply a degree of judgment and reason not otherwise seen in the animal kingdom.

Psychologist Matt J. Rossano argues that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include [[supernatural]] agents. By including ever-watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.&lt;ref name="supernature"&gt;

Rossano is referring here to collective religious belief and the social sanction that institutionalized morality. According to Rossano's teaching, individual religious belief is thus initially epistemological, not ethical, in nature.

==Evolutionary psychology of religion==
{{Main|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Cognitive scientists underlined that religions may be explained as a result of the brain architecture that expressed in early [[Homo#list of species|''Homo'' genus]], through the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|history of life]]. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. The two main schools of thought hold that either religion evolved due to [[natural selection]] and has selective advantage, or that religion is an evolutionary byproduct of other mental adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf Evolutionary Religious Studies (ERS): A Beginner's Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204211/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]], for example, believed that religion was an [[exaptation]] or a [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]], in other words that religion evolved as byproduct of psychological mechanisms that evolved for other reasons.&lt;ref name="henig"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html|title=Darwin's God|date=4 March 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf Toward an evolutionary psychology of religion and personality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm|title=The evolutionary psychology of religion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063432/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm |archive-date=2008-05-09 |author=[[Steven Pinker]]|date=29 October 2004|website=harvard.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm (agent detection), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events ([[etiology]]), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions ([[theory of mind]]). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 16035401|url= http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|title= Religion's evolutionary landscape: counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion.|year= 2004|journal= [[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]|last1= Atran|first1= S|last2= Norenzayan|first2= A|volume= 27|issue= 6|pages= 713–30; discussion 730–70|doi= 10.1017/s0140525x04000172|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165354/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|archivedate= 2008-08-07|df= |citeseerx= 10.1.1.687.8586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of collective religious belief identified the agents as deities that standardized the explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1–11|volume = 0|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tamás|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that religion is genetically "hardwired" into the human condition. One controversial proposal, the [[God gene]] hypothesis, states that some variants of a specific gene, the [[Vesicular monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]] gene, predispose to spirituality.&lt;ref name="kluger2004"&gt;{{cite news

Another view is based on the concept of the [[triune brain]]: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex, proposed by [[Paul D. MacLean]]. Collective religious belief draws upon the emotions of love, fear, and gregariousness and is deeply embedded in the limbic system through socio-biological conditioning and social sanction. Individual religious belief utilizes reason based in the neocortex and often varies from collective religion. The limbic system is much older in evolutionary terms than the neocortex and is, therefore, stronger than it much in the same way as the reptilian is stronger than both the limbic system and the neocortex.

Yet another view is that the behavior of people who participate in a religion makes them feel better and this improves their fitness, so that there is a genetic selection in favor of people who are willing to believe in religion.  Specifically, rituals, beliefs, and the social contact typical of religious groups may serve to calm the mind (for example by reducing ambiguity and the uncertainty due to complexity) and allow it to function better when under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Lionel Tiger and Michael McGuire | title = God's Brain | publisher = Prometheus Books | date = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-61614-164-6}} see pages 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow religion to be used as a powerful survival mechanism, particularly in facilitating the evolution of [[War#Motivations|hierarchies]] of [[Killer ape theory|warriors]], which if true, may be why many modern religions tend to promote [[fertility]] and [[family|kinship]].

Still another view, proposed by F.H. Previc, is that human religion was a product of an increase in dopaminergic functions in the human brain and a general intellectual expansion beginning around 80 kya.&lt;ref&gt;Previc, F.H. (2009).

==Prehistoric evidence of religion==
{{See also|Paleolithic religion|Prehistoric religion}}

The exact time when humans first became [[religion|religious]] remains unknown, however research in evolutionary archaeology shows credible evidence of religious-cum-ritualistic behaviour from around the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era (45-200 [[tya (unit)|thousand years ago]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5954/784|title=On the Origin of Religion|first=Elizabeth|last=Culotta|date=6 November 2009|journal=Science|volume=326|issue=5954|pages=784–787|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.326_784|pmid=19892955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleolithic burials===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Skhul burial.jpg|thumb|right|400px|90,000 year old double burial of Homo sapiens at [[Qafzeh]] cave in Israel]] --&gt;
The earliest evidence of religious thought is based on the ritual treatment of the dead. Most animals display only a casual interest in the dead of their own species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8209 Elephants may pay homage to the dead]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual burial thus represents a significant change in human behavior. Ritual burials represent an awareness of life and death and a possible belief in the [[afterlife]]. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "burials with grave goods clearly signify religious practices and concern for the dead that transcends daily life."&lt;ref name="lieberman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA162 | title=Uniquely Human|isbn=978-0-674-92183-2| year=1991|last=Lieberman| authorlink=Philip Lieberman |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence for treatment of the dead comes from [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]] in Spain. At this location the bones of 30 individuals believed to be ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' have been found in a pit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Q3nOqkJQwoC&amp;pg=PA158 |title=How Symbols, Language, and Intelligence Evolved from Early Primates to Modern Human|authorlink=Stanley Greenspan|last=Greenspan|first=Stanley|isbn=978-0-306-81449-5|year=2006|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Neanderthals]] are also contenders for the first [[Hominidae|hominids]] to intentionally bury the dead. They may have placed corpses into shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones. The presence of these [[grave goods]] may indicate an emotional connection with the deceased and possibly a belief in the afterlife. Neanderthal burial sites include [[Shanidar]] in Iraq and [[Krapina]] in Croatia and [[Kebara Cave]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|title= The Neanderthal dead:exploring mortuary variability in Middle Palaeolithic Eurasia|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|archivedate= 2008-09-10|df= }}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving_graves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving_graves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_24_160/ai_81827792/pg_1|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|author=|date=|website=findarticles.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC article on the Neanderthals|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A21606040|quote=Neanderthals buried their dead, and one burial at [[Shanidar]] in Iraq was accompanied by grave goods in the form of plants. All of the plants are used in recent times for medicinal purposes, and it seems likely that the Neanderthals also used them in this way and buried them with their dead for the same reason. Grave goods are an archaeological marker of belief in an afterlife, so Neanderthals may well have had some form of religious belief.}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known burial of modern humans is from a cave in Israel located at [[Qafzeh]]. Human remains have been dated to 100,000 years ago. Human skeletons were found stained with [[red ochre]]. A variety of grave goods were found at the burial site. The mandible of a wild boar was found placed in the arms of one of the skeletons.&lt;ref name="lieberman2"&gt;. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA163 Uniquely Human page 163]&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Lieberman states:
:"Burial rituals incorporating grave goods may have been invented by the anatomically modern hominids who emigrated from Africa to the Middle East roughly 100,000 years ago".&lt;ref name="lieberman2"/&gt;

Matt Rossano suggests that the period between 80,000–60,000 years before present, following the retreat of humans from the Levant to Africa, was a crucial period in the evolution of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/recentpubs/Springer%20chapter.pdf|title=The African Interregnum: The "Where," "When," and "Why" of the Evolution of Religion|year=2009|last=Rossano|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-00128-4_9|first1=Matt|pages=127–141|series=The Frontiers Collection|isbn=978-3-642-00127-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of symbolism===
The use of [[Religious symbolism|symbolism in religion]] is a universal established phenomenon. Archeologist [[Steven Mithen]] contends that it is common for religious practices to involve the creation of images and symbols to represent supernatural beings and ideas. Because supernatural beings violate the principles of the natural world, there will always be difficulty in communicating and sharing supernatural concepts with others. This problem can be overcome by anchoring these supernatural beings in material form through representational art. When translated into material form, supernatural concepts become easier to communicate and understand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BRyMgrYx3EUC&amp;pg=PA147 Symbolism and the Supernatural]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the association of art and religion, evidence of symbolism in the fossil record is indicative of a mind capable of religious thoughts. Art and symbolism demonstrates a capacity for abstract thought and imagination necessary to construct religious ideas. Wentzel van Huyssteen states that the translation of the non-visible through symbolism enabled early human ancestors to hold beliefs in abstract terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Uniqueness and Symbolization|url=http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|quote=This 'coding of the non-visible' through abstract, symbolic thought, enabled also our early human ancestors to argue and hold beliefs in abstract terms. In fact, the concept of God itself follows from the ability to abstract and conceive of 'person'|access-date=2008-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527011227/http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|archive-date=2009-05-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest evidence of symbolic behavior is associated with [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. From at least 100,000 years ago, there is evidence of the use of pigments such as [[red ochre]]. Pigments are of little practical use to hunter gatherers, thus evidence of their use is interpreted as symbolic or for ritual purposes. Among extant hunter gatherer populations around the world, red ochre is still used extensively for ritual purposes. It has been argued that it is universal among human cultures for the color red to represent blood, sex, life and death.&lt;ref name="rossano"&gt;
{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of red ochre as a proxy for symbolism is often criticized as being too indirect. Some scientists, such as [[Richard Klein (paleoanthropologist)|Richard Klein]] and [[Steven Mithen]], only recognize unambiguous forms of art as representative of abstract ideas. Upper paleolithic cave art provides some of the most unambiguous evidence of religious thought from the paleolithic. Cave paintings at [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] depict creatures that are half human and half animal.

Organised religion traces its roots to the [[neolithic revolution]] that began 11,000 years ago in the [[Near East]] but may have occurred independently in several other locations around the world. The invention of agriculture transformed many human societies from a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to a [[sedentism|sedentary lifestyle]]. The consequences of the neolithic revolution included a population explosion and an acceleration in the pace of technological development. The transition from foraging bands to states and empires precipitated more specialized and developed forms of religion that reflected the new social and political environment. While bands and small tribes possess supernatural beliefs, these beliefs do not serve to justify a central authority, justify transfer of wealth or maintain peace between unrelated individuals.
Organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability through the following ways:
*Justifying the central authority, which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services.
*Bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals. However, states and nations are composed of many thousands of unrelated individuals. [[Jared Diamond]] argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity. In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' he argues that the leading cause of death among hunter-gatherer societies is murder.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;

The states born out of the Neolithic revolution, such as those of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, were [[theocracies]] with chiefs, kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and spiritual leaders.&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt; Anthropologists have found that virtually all state societies and chiefdoms from around the world have been found to justify political power through divine authority. This suggests that political authority co-opts collective religious belief to bolster itself.&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt;

===Invention of writing===
{{See also|History of writing}}
Following the neolithic revolution, the pace of technological development (cultural evolution) intensified due to the invention of writing 5000 years ago. Symbols that became words later on made effective communication of ideas possible. Printing invented only over a thousand years ago increased the speed of communication exponentially and became the main spring of cultural evolution.
Writing is thought to have been first invented in either Sumeria or Ancient Egypt and was initially used for accounting. Soon after, writing was used to record myth. The first religious texts mark the beginning of [[History of religion|religious history]]. The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt are one of the oldest known religious texts in the world, dating to between 2400–2300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9 | title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|first= Wallis|last= Budge|authorlink = E.

In pre-literate societies, religious ideas were based on an [[oral tradition]], the contents of which were articulated by shamans and remained limited to the collective memories of the society's inhabitants. With the advent of writing, information that was not easy to remember could easily be stored in sacred texts that were maintained by a select group (clergy). Humans could store and process large amounts of information with writing that otherwise would have been forgotten. Writing therefore enabled religions to develop coherent and comprehensive doctrinal systems that remained independent of time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnnnAwMfeV0C&amp;pg=PA160#PPA160,M1|chapter=Holy Book:The Invention of writing and religious cognition|title=Magic, Miracles, and Religion: A Scientist's Perspective | first=Ilkka|last=Pyysiäinen|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7591-0663-5|publisher=AltMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing also brought a measure of objectivity to human knowledge. Formulation of thoughts in words and the requirement for validation made mutual exchange of ideas and the sifting of generally acceptable from not acceptable ideas possible. The generally acceptable ideas became objective knowledge reflecting the continuously evolving framework of human awareness of reality that [[Karl Popper]] calls 'verisimilitude' – a stage on the human journey to truth.&lt;ref&gt;''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', 1972, Rev. ed., 1979, {{ISBN|0-19-875024-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fake or Fortune?''''' is a [[BBC One]] television series which examines the [[provenance]] and attribution of notable [[art]]works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rts.org.uk/award/rts-west-england-awards-2016|title=RTS West of England Awards 2016 {{!}} Royal Television Society|website=rts.org.uk|language=en|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first series aired in 2011, ''Fake or Fortune?'' has drawn audiences of 5 million viewers in the UK&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/its-a-copy-fake-or-fortune-stars-try-to-halt-rival-show-6gstpwtrz |title=It’s a copy: Fake or Fortune? stars try to halt rival show |last=Brooks |first=Richard |date=4 December 2016 |work=The Times |access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the highest for an arts show in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbcstudios.com/case-studies/fake-or-fortune|title=Fake or Fortune|website=www.bbcstudios.com|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fake or Fortune?'' was created by [[art dealer]] and [[art history|art historian]] [[Philip Mould]] and producer Simon Shaw, inspired by Mould’s book ''Sleuth'' (2009), which was the programme’s working title during the development phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiquestradegazette.com/print-edition/2017/august/2304/interview/behind-the-scenes-at-fake-or-fortune/|title=Behind the scenes at Fake or Fortune? {{!}} Antiques Trade Gazette|last=Media|first=ATG|website=www.antiquestradegazette.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-presented by Mould and [[journalism|journalist]] [[Fiona Bruce]], with specialist research carried out by Dr. [[Bendor Grosvenor]] during the first five seasons.

==Synopsis==
In each episode Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce focus their attention on a painting (or a group of paintings), usually related to one particular artist. Season 7, episode 5 saw the show tackle their first [[sculpture]], a work attributed to [[Alberto Giacometti]]. The team, assisted by [[Bendor Grosvenor]] in series 1 to 5, investigate the paintings on a number of fronts: establishing the provenance of the piece by working backwards from present day to the time of the work's creation; on a forensic level, with investigation and scientific tests on the materials used to help establish specific time frames; and examining the unique painting styles and quirks of the artist. This evidence is then presented to established authorities to help demonstrate the legitimacy of the work and its possible addition to the relevant [[catalogue raisonné]].

| ShortSummary    = Experts determined whether three works - ''Lady with Dogs'', ''Darby and Joan'' and ''Crowd Scene'' - were genuine paintings by [[L. S. Lowry]] or forgeries. They had been bought in the 1960s by a Cheshire businessman, Gerald Ames. Lowry was described as "probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers." Experts analysed the paint used in one of the paintings, but the white paint did not match the flake white Lowry claimed to have always used. Lowry claimed to have only used five colours, [[White lead|flake white (lead white)]], [[ivory black]], [[Vermilion|vermillion red]], [[Prussian blue]] and [[yellow ochre]], produced by [[Winsor &amp; Newton]]. Photographic evidence from the 1950s, however, showed that he had experimented with both [[titanium white]] and [[zinc white]]: ''Darby and Joan'' contained traces of zinc white. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0612kxh/fake-or-fortune-series-4-1-lowry |title=BBC iPlayer - Fake or Fortune? - Series 4: 1.

| ShortSummary    = Charles Henty seeks to validate the provenance of two inherited paintings, one by [[Alfred Munnings]] and one, putatively by [[Winston Churchill]], discovered in a coal hole of a house in [[Ebury Street]]. Having suffered the death of his uncle, Charles wishes to sell the paintings to fund the continuation of a working farm in France.

Philip Mould visits David Coombs, a leading expert on the art of Churchill, who is unconvinced by the painting on account of the unfamiliarly well painted figures. He is particularly concerned by the colouring which, he feels, is tonally dissimilar to Churchill's accepted oeuvre. Having travelled to [[France]], the team discover, thanks to Luc Tombeur, that the painting is not of [[Èze]], as originally thought, but of the Fountain of Saint-Paul in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]]. They are introduced to Joy Lutenbacher, who recalls that her aunt, Joan Smith, witnessed Churchill paint the fountain. Bendor Grosvenor also finds evidence in a 1949 newsreel that Churchill painted the scene. Finally, Lutenbacher provides a signed photo of Churchill that had been given to Joan Smith, dated October 1945. Despite this evidence, Coombs' initial 'serious misgivings' have not disappeared, and he decides to include the painting in his [[catalogue raisonné]], although only in the 'Mysteries' section.

Munnings' painting ''[[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]] Winter Landscape'' is found to be of a scene of which the artist was particularly fond and painted more than five times. In a twist of fate, the church depicted in the painting is the final resting place of a notorious art forger, [[Tom Keating]], who was known to have forged Munnings' work. However, this is a mere coincidence and experts Lorian Peralta-Ramos and Dr Bill Teatheredge agree that the painting should be accepted as a work by Munnings.

| ShortSummary       = A [[portrait]] purportedly done by [[Lucian Freud]] is brought to the attention of the team. However, an outright denial by Freud himself looms over the team; the artist claimed he never painted the artwork under investigation. Faced with repudiating the words of the artist himself, the team trace the painting back to Freud's time during his teenage years at [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]], just before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Fiona finds out through both a previous work's history and through an interview with Freud's daughter that Freud didn't consider works he finished himself to be worthy of his attention, especially ones where someone else had done work on his artwork, suggesting a reason for his denial. Despite the hope of [[DNA evidence]] by an embedded hair in the painting not panning out, notes from Freud's [[solicitor]] and forensic evidence of the paint and the paint strokes indicate most of the painting was done by one hand, possibly done on an abandoned canvas that already was painted beforehand at the art school Freud attended and then discarded to the side. In the end, when presented with the collected evidence, a panel of three experts on Freud's work deem the painting to have been mostly done by Freud, significantly increasing its value at auction.

| DirectedBy      = Nicky Illis
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2016|07|24|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = A woman asks the team to prove [[Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary|a work]], housed at Castle of Park in [[Aberdeenshire]], was painted by [[Paul Delaroche]]. The painting was acquired by the woman's husband when he worked for [[Christie's]] back in the 1980s, but he never managed to get it authenticated before he died. Delaroche did paint Saint Amelia as a royal commission done for [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily|Maria Amalia]], wife of [[Louis Philippe I]], before they were deposed in 1848. The artwork could thus be a [[lost work]] from the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. The alternative Philip needs to investigate is if it is instead a (legitimate) copy done by contemporary painters or printmakers, as Delaroche proved popular to replicate. Bendor reveals at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in [[Surrey]], where [[Queen Victoria]] offered the deposed couple refuge from the Revolution, that the artwork in question did reach English shores, as it is prominently displayed in a painting of Amalia's bedroom by historical watercolour artist [[Joseph Nash]]. Differences in colour to known copies of the painting are scientifically explained by pigment degradation. Though the team is unable to establish the provenance between the death of Maria Amalia's son in 1896 and the 1980s purchase, the painting is still deemed to be a genuine Delaroche and the lost work of Maria Amalia. In an 11th hour surprise, the appraiser reveals a letter written by Delaroche where he details how he was disgusted at the pitiful state of the picture when he saw it looking over the commission of a [[stained glass window]] version of his artwork and he undertakes the task of restoring the picture back to its former state, thus explaining the rest of the artifacts revealed by the forensic analysis.

| DirectedBy      = Francis Welch
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2016|07|31|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  A [[Lincolnshire]] resident asks the team to investigate a sketch that is purported to be done by [[Auguste Rodin]]. Known primarily for sculptures like ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Thinker]]'', Rodin was also accomplished as an artist in other forms, his best known work being a series of [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] of a [[Royal ballet of Cambodia|Cambodian dance troupe]] that toured in Paris around the turn of the 20th century. The drawing was inherited from the owner's mother while she was living in Mexico in the 1940s after doing some work for the interior of a restaurant. Bendor's research reveals that of an estimated 150 Cambodian sketches done by Rodin, 120 are in the [[Musee Rodin]] and 21 authentic works are in other museums, which leaves fewer than 10 in private hands. In addition, Rodin was an often-counterfeited artist in both his sculptures and artwork. The name [[Ernest Durig]] pops up in the research: at the time, he was known as a respectable sculptor and art dealer, but long after the drawing was given to the owner's mother, Durig was exposed as a prolific forger of Rodin; his name was most recently at the center of a Rodin sketches forgery scandal at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 2014. Going to the Musée Rodin, Fiona finds out that the dancers had mesmerized Rodin so much that one series of sketches was done on wrapping paper obtained from a [[greengrocer]], due to his forgetting his sketch paper. When looking at several other sketches, Philip latches on to a particular technique of Rodin, where he blotted the watercolours with minimal strokes while making the dancers seem to be floating. Denied access to a cache of Durig sketches at [[MoMA]] for comparison, a signature expert casts more doubt, leading Fiona to reveal that Rodin would leave it up to recipients of his sketches to make their own signature, as he couldn't be cared to sign his works. The appraiser who revealed the Rodin fakes at the Musée d'Orsay deems the sketch to be not by Rodin, but by the forger Durig.

| ShortSummary       = [[Queensland]] residents Joe and Rosanna Natoli bought a painting with the signature "[[Tom Roberts]]" at auction for £7,500. Expert opinion after the purchase, however, was that it was not by the important Australian impressionist of that name. [[Infrared]] examination revealed that the back had the title "Rejected", the name Tom Roberts and an address in London's [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]] that was shown to be Roberts' address while studying at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. Roberts' sketchbooks showed initial studies which appeared to be preliminaries for the work under investigation.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2017|09|10|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate two possible works by [[Paul Gauguin]] which have been brought to their attention. One appeared to be the first pencil sketch for Gauguin's Tahitian masterpiece ''[[When Will You Marry?|When Will you Marry?]].'' It had been bought by the viewer's art historian grandfather, but its authenticity was in doubt because it appeared to be a copy of a sketch in Gauguin's notebook. The team establish provenance that takes it back to Gauguin and show that it had been cut from the sketchbook sometime between 1916 and 1932. It is accepted as genuine by the Wildenstein Institute.

The second possible Gauguin is a still life depicting a bowl of fruit which had been sold as a genuine Gauguin several times and had appeared in a [[catalogue Raisonne]]. However, the signature and dedication had been added after the original paint had dried and the signature did not appear genuine. The sale in which it had first appeared included a number of works now attributed to other artists. Connoisseurship also raises doubts about the style and Mould and Bruce conclude that it is not genuine.

| ShortSummary       = A [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicolson]] painting, of a glass jug, plates and two pears, was purchased by a collector from the estate of her aunt, [[Lillian Browse]], a respected gallery owner and author of Nicholson's catalogue raisonné. The painting is not included, however, in the current catalogue raisonné compiled by expert Patricia Reed. A wealth of new scientific and documentary evidence was collected, including provenance to a previous wealthy London art-collector, [[x-ray]] evidence to show the board had originally borne a painting of [[freesia]]s (missing from Nicolson's catalogue), and a comparison of the pigments in the paint with traces left in an original painting box owned by Nicolson's grandson. Reed does not change her opinion, however, stating that there is insufficient evidence to show that it was definitely by Nicholson.&lt;ref name=Express2018-08-12/&gt; and not someone working alongside him.&lt;ref name="BBC-b0bg6f43"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicholson |series=''Fake or Fortune?'' |serieslink=Fake or Fortune? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bg6f43/fake-or-fortune-series-7-1-nicholson |accessdate=18 August 2018 |network= [[BBC Television]] |date= 12 August 2018  |seriesno=7 |number=1 |transcript= |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|19|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  Two sketchbooks found in a garden shed in [[Saint-Émilion]] were given to a teenage boy, Alain, by his grandmother in 1965. Although she never revealed their origin, they were thought to be the work of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Alain waited 50 years before presenting the sketches to the committee responsible for authenticating the work of Toulouse-Lautrec. The committee did not accept them as authentic and concluded they were the work of another artist [[René Princeteau]]. The sketchbooks contain images of women, horses, sailors, soldiers and dogs, not the subjects for which Toulouse-Lautrec is best known. Some of the pages are dated 1880, when Toulouse-Lautrec would have been just a teenager. The team travel to [[Albi]] in southern France, where Toulouse-Lautrec was born, and visit his family home, Chateau du Bosc, where he spent much of his youth. Compelling technical analysis is provided by print expert Harriet Stratis from [[Chicago]] who reports that the sketchbooks match those already known to be by Toulouse-Lautrec and that some sheets have tiny pin-pricks in each corner, which are a distinctive feature of the artist's hand. The committee does not provide a clear decision either way, but offers to re-examine the books at a later date.

| ShortSummary       = The team investigate whether a small watercolour sketch could be by the British 20th-century sculptor [[Henry Moore]], thought to be the only piece by a British artist in a private collection of around 1,500 works discovered in Germany in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/drawing-in-the-gurlitt-hoard-an-unknown-henry-moore-1193831&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[2012 Munich artworks discovery|Gurlitt Hoard]], it is suspected to contain many objects of art looted by the Nazis, and the team is now asked by the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern|Museum of Fine Art]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, to find out if the sketch is among these. Philip meets Moore's only child Mary, who says she can see her father's hand in the sketch. Forensic tests on the ink used in the sketch are inconclusive, but [[infrared]] analysis reveals more sketches on the back of the paper. Fiona discovers that in the early 1930s [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], the man who amassed the hoard, worked as a museum curator and exhibited works by Moore who, at the time, was less appreciated at home in Britain. Furthermore, Gurlitt later became one of only four dealers asked to sell off what the Nazis branded as [[degenerate art]] on the international market, purchasing some for himself. When the team find an accurate description of the sketch, they can link one of Gurlitt's purchases to what was exhibited years before, thus establishing an unbroken provenance. In the end the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] accepts the sketch as a genuine Moore.

| Title             = A Double Whodunnit
| DirectedBy        = Francis Welch

| ShortSummary      = The team investigates two rare portraits of [[black British]] subjects from the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures which are highly unusual in their positive depiction of black sitters at a time when Britain was still heavily engaged in [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]]. 

The first case is a double portrait featuring [[Dido Elizabeth Belle|Dido Belle]], a former slave who became a member of the aristocratic Mansfield family, and her cousin Lady Elizabeth. The painting is on display at [[Scone Palace]] in Scotland and was commissioned by the first [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], Dido Belle's guardian, sometime in the late 1770s or early 1780s. The [[Abolitionism|abolishionist]] Mansfield, a judge, had ruled in the infamous case of the [[Zong massacre]]. The painting's original attribution, to [[Johan Zoffany]], is considered wrong, but the identity of the actual artist is unclear. The second painting, even more unusual, is of two beautifully-dressed black girls holding a book in what appears to be a tropical landscape. Early clues suggest this could be a political painting, perhaps connected to the campaign to abolish slavery in British colonies. The signature was not legible.

In the end, forensic and other evidence revealed the first portrait to be by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]] and the second by [[Emma Soyer|Emma Jones]].

Philip visits the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]] at the University of East Anglia, where he learns more about how the cast would have been produced. The investigation leads Fiona to France where the current owner's grandmother modelled at the same time and place where Giacometti worked. Without a clear trail of evidence linking the piece to the sculptor, however, the team changes its approach, and discovers that one of the genuine ''Gazing Head'' plasters is considered lost by its British owner, the estate of [[Sidney John Woods|S. J. Woods]], suggesting that it might be possible the piece was purchased from Woods rather than in Paris. 

When the piece and the collected evidence is presented to the [[Giacometti Foundation]] in Paris, the first response is that further studies needed to be made. After several months - the episode was originally scheduled to be aired as part of series 6&lt;ref name="Giacometti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti" /&gt; - their provisional findings conclude the piece was once an original sculpture by Giacometti, but that the damage sustained may prevent them from accepting it as a genuine work.

Describing the outcome of the first episode of series one as a "scandal", Sam Wollaston writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' found the programme "incredibly interesting" and praised it "for being about just one case in which you can become totally involved, instead of flitting between three, which is what so many documentaries seem to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|title=TV review: ''Fake or Fortune?''; ''The Marriage Ref''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/19/tv-review-fake-or-fortune|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Ceri Radford was described as being "flabbergasted" at the result of the first episode, but concluded her review by saying: "This may have been a disappointing finale, but it at least confirmed that this aesthetically pleasing, quietly enjoyable new series isn't afraid to thwart expectations."&lt;ref name="Radford" /&gt; [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] in ''[[The Independent]]'' had a mixed view as a result of the presentation of the facts, saying: "It was full of cliffhanger tension and thrilling moments of discovery.

[[Feminist theory]] as it relates to [[architecture]] has forged the way for the rediscovery of such [[women in architecture|female architects]] as [[Eileen Gray]]. These women imagined an architecture that challenged the way the traditional family would live. They practiced architecture with what they considered feminist theories or approaches. The rediscovery of architecture through feminist theory is not limited to female architects. Architects like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Adolf Loos]] have also had their architecture reexamined through feminist theory.

==The architecture==
In [[Dolores Hayden]]'s book ''The Grand Domestic Revolution'' she explains the ways in which "a lost feminine tradition" led to a "redefining of house work and the housing needs of women and their families, push[ing] architects and urban planners to reconsider the effects of design on family life".&lt;ref&gt;Dolores Hayden, ''The Grand Domestic Revolution: A History of Feminist Designs for American Homes, Neighborhoods, and Cities,'' MIT Press, 1981. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the changing needs of the family can be seen in the houses of Truus Schröder, Eileen Gray and LeCorbusier's [[Villa Stein]] de-Monzie. The [[Rietveld Schröder House]] is an excellent example of the way that the "modern" lives of the family demanded a new architecture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Schröder House was not only a creative work of artistic design but offered its users a new environment in which to redefine family life, women's rights and the responsibilities of individuals and to each other"&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., "Family Matters: The Schroder House, by Gerrit Rietveld and Truus Schröder," [[Yale University Press]], 2006. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movable walls and partitions give a sense of consciousness and an overall feeling that the architecture was built with a greater purpose. The fact that Truus Schröder's beliefs in the family and as the house playing a part in the family; the house almost as a member.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Truus Schröder is closely related to Dutch and European [[feminism]] of the twentieth century, based on her goals for her house.

Eileen Gray's [[E-1027]] is another example of feminist theory being applied to architecture.

Much like Schröder, Gray designed an architecture that would address the needs of the occupants and the new family unit. Gray worked within the model of modern architecture, LeCorbusier's "5 points of new architecture" for example as well as addressing the issues of the building or home as an experience.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, Caroline. "E1027: The Nonheroic Modernism of Eileen Gray," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians,'' vol.53, September 1994. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Like E1027 and The Schroder House, Villa Stein de Monzie was rediscovered through feminist theory. More well known is the way in which this house called gender relations and the way in which the relationship between men and women was negotiated in a new way.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., ''Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History.'' Yale University Press, 2006, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

This house is of particular importance in feminist theory because it called into question the typical domestic group and gender relations. This domestic group that included a married couple and a woman with her child called domestic space into question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">There is a criticism of the [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]].  The criticism stems from the fact that this measurement of [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] does not account for [[environmental degradation]] and [[resource depletion]].  A new approach to the situation of allocating these omitted environmental features in the [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] has been the advent of the '''green national product'''.

== Criticism of gross national product ==

The [[gross national product]] (GNP) measures the [[Welfare economics|welfare]] of a nation's economy through the aggregate of products and services produced in that nation.  Although GNP is a proficient measurement of the magnitude of the economy, many economists, environmentalists and citizens have been arguing the validity of the GNP in respect to measuring [[Welfare economics|welfare]].  [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize–winning economist]], states that this standard measurement for any [[national economy]] has become deficient as a measure of long-term economic health in our recently resource-driven and [[Globalization|globalizing]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/02/8387507/index.htm?postversion=2006092508 | title=Good Numbers Gone Bad | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2008-04-02 | date=2006-10-02 | first=Joseph | last=Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics suggest that GNP often includes the environment on the wrong side of the balance sheet because if someone first pollutes and then another person cleans the pollution, both activities add to GNP making environmental degradation frequently look good for the economy.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | title=Green Accounting | publisher=[[Gernot Wagner]] | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307223603/http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | archive-date=2008-03-07 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of [[mainstream economics]] complain that GNP compiles spending that makes us worse off, spending that allows us to stay in the same place, and spending that makes us better off all in a single measure, giving a nation no clue if they are making progress or not.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", [[University Press of America]], c1994. p.2 "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Manfred Max-Neef]], Chilean economist, explains that politicians feel that it is irrelevant whether the spending is productive, unproductive, or destructive.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"/&gt;  In this sense, it is common to see political policies that call to depredate a natural resource in order to increase the GNP.  To take into account the environmental depredation and resource depletion, there is a call to shift away from the traditional GNP and construct an assessment of national product that takes into account environmental effects.

== History ==

=== Measure of economic welfare ===

Ever since the Industrial Revolution, scientists and economists have warned of an [[inflection point]] for the United States economy where expansion is inevitably limited by the steadily decreasing availability of natural resources.  In 1973, [[William D. Nordhaus]] and [[James Tobin]], [[Yale University|Yale]] economists, were the first to question the GNP in "is growth obsolete?"  Nordhaus and Tobin developed a [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW) and stated that welfare must be sustainable, in the sense that nations that devour their stock of capital are not as "well" as the national income would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p03b/p0398a.pdf |format = pdf |  title=Is Growth Obsolete? | publisher=Milton Moss | year=1973 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Index of sustainable economic welfare ===

However, in "The Green National Product", Clifford Cobb and John Cobb argue that the Measure of Economic Welfare failed to encompass the depletion of [[natural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.10-11 "How to Measure Welfare: Some Options"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989, [[Herman Daly]], John Cobb, and Clifford Cobb created what is known as the [[Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare]] (ISEW).  This new measurement of welfare was created in the hopes that it would replace the flawed GNP.  Herman Daly stated that the key flaw of the traditional GNP was that it ignored core accounting principles of business where all revenues and expenses are allocated to income.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | publisher=National Public Radio | date=April 9, 2004 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233502/http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archive-date=2008-04-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ISEW called for ecological and economic sustainability to coincide since the economy is ultimately dependent on the natural resources that the earth provides.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than the original GNP, ISEW takes into account costs that are naturally unsustainable.  By creating ISEW, they wanted to expand the current national product so that individuals, businesses, and governments could take actions that will generally enhance welfare, rather than merely enhancing the traditional GNP.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280-281 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genuine progress indicator ===

In 1995, Redefining Progress created the [[genuine progress indicator]] (GPI) as an alternative to the traditional GNP.  This new measurement of national income would allow policymakers to gauge how well citizens are, economically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redifining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike welfare adjustments in the past like MEW and ISEW, GPI adjusts not only for environmental depredation, but also for income distribution, housework, volunteering, crime, changes in leisure time, and life-span of consumer durables and public infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redefining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of the first alternatives to the traditional GNP to be used by the scientific community and governmental organizations globally.

=== In the United States ===

In 1992, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA) of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] initiated intensive work to create an environmental accounting system.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rcted.ncu.edu.tw/speech/On%20Green%20NP%202007%201117[1].pdf |format = pdf |  title=On "Green National Product": Theories and a Comparison Among Difference Approaches | publisher=Eolss Publishers | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BEA began by creating satellite accounts with easily measurable commodities such as petroleum and coal.  The first BEA publication was the U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic Satellite Accounts (IEESA) in 1994.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;  The initial results were quite significant, and showed how GNP was overestimating the impact of mining industries in respect to the nations economic wealth.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"/&gt;  Mining companies didn't care for the initial publications, for obvious reasons, and soon [[Alan Mollohan]], a Democratic House Representative from [[West Virginia]]'s coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 [[Appropriation Bill]].  In response, Congress directed the BEA to suspend further work in [[Sustainability measurement|environmental accounting]], and to obtain an external review on their findings.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;

== Need ==

Many people are calling for a green national product that would indicate if activities benefit or harm the economy and well-being.  This green national product would revolve around the social and economic issues on which many green movements have focused: care for the earth and all that sustain it.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"/&gt;  This new national product would differ from the traditional GNP by addressing both the sustainability and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"/&gt;  It is essential that this system takes into account natural capital, which is currently hidden from our traditional measurement.

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden St Luke Some Chick MFA Boston.jpg|thumb|''Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin'', c. 1435–1440. 137.5 x 110.8cm. [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. This was the classic subject for paintings given to the guilds]]
The '''Guild of Saint Luke''' was the most common name for a city [[guild]] for painters and other artists in [[early modern Europe]], especially in the [[Low Countries]]. They were named in honor of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]] [[Saint Luke|Luke]], the [[patron saint]] of artists, who was identified by [[John of Damascus]] as having painted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin's]] portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Howe.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous such organizations was founded in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford-Wille.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to function until 1795, although by then it had lost its [[Legal monopoly|monopoly]] and therefore most of its power. In most cities, including Antwerp, the local government had given the Guild the power to regulate defined types of trade within the city.  Guild membership, as a master, was therefore required for an artist to take on apprentices or to sell paintings to the public. Similar rules existed in [[Delft]], where only members could sell paintings in the city or have a shop.&lt;ref&gt;Montias (1977): 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The early guilds in Antwerp and [[Bruges]], setting a model that would be followed in other cities, even had their own showroom or market stall from which members could sell their paintings directly to the public.&lt;ref name="prak248"&gt;Prak (2003): 248.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The guild of Saint Luke not only represented painters, sculptors, and other visual artists, but also—especially in the seventeenth century—dealers, amateurs, and even art lovers (the so-called ''liefhebbers'').&lt;ref name="prak249"&gt;Prak (2004): 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period most members in most places were probably [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], where these were in the same guild as painters on wood and cloth—in many cities they were joined with the scribes or "scriveners". In traditional guild structures, house-painters and decorators were often in the same guild. However, as artists formed under their own specific guild of St. Luke, particularly in the Netherlands, distinctions were increasingly made.&lt;ref name="smith432"&gt;Smith (1999): 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, guilds also made judgments on disputes between artists and other artists or their clients.&lt;ref name="prak249" /&gt; In such ways, it controlled the economic career of an artist working in a specific city, while in different cities they were wholly independent and often competitive against each other. 

==Antwerp ==
Although it did not become a major artistic center until the sixteenth century, Antwerp was one of, if not the first, city to found a guild of Saint Luke. It is first mentioned in 1382, and was given special privileges by the city in 1442.&lt;ref name="baudouin"&gt;Baudouin (1973): 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The registers, or ''[[Liggeren]]'', from the guild exist, cataloging when artists became masters, who the dean for each year was, what their specialities were, and the names of any students.&lt;ref name="baudouin" /&gt;  In Bruges, however, which was the dominant city for artistic production in the Low Countries in the fifteenth century, the earliest known list of guild members dates to 1453, although the guild was certainly older than this.  There all artists had to belong to the guild in order to practice in their own names or to sell their works, and the guild was very strict about which artistic activities could be practiced–distinctly forbidding an artisan to work in an area where another guild's members, such as tapestry weaving, were represented.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell (1976): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Bruges==
The Bruges guild, in a typically idiosyncratic medieval arrangement, also included the saddlemakers, probably because most members were painting [[illuminated manuscript]]s on [[vellum]], and were therefore grouped as a sort of leatherworker. Perhaps because of this link, for a period they had a rule that all miniatures needed a tiny mark to identify the artist, which was registered with the Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar (1980): 371–383.&lt;/ref&gt;   Only under special privileges, such as court artist, could an artist effectively practice their craft without holding membership in the guild.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens]] had a similar situation in the seventeenth century, when he obtained special permission from the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]] to be both court artist in [[Brussels]] and an active member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership also allowed members to sell works at the guild-owned showroom. Antwerp, for example, opened a market stall for selling paintings in front of the  [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|cathedral]] in 1460, and Bruges followed in 1482.&lt;ref name="prak248" /&gt;

==Dutch Republic==
[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Governors of the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]] in 1675. [[Jan de Bray]] painted himself second from the left. Surprisingly, fewer such group portraits exist for painters than other Guild occupations.]] 
Guilds of St. Luke in the [[Dutch Republic]] began to reinvent themselves as cities there changed over to Protestant rule, and there were dramatic movements in population.  Many St. Luke guilds reissued charters to protect the interests of local painters from the influx of southern talent from places like Antwerp and Bruges. Many cities in the young republic became more important artistic centres in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. [[Amsterdam]] was the first city to reissue a St. Luke's charter after the reformation in 1579, and it included painters, sculptors, engravers, and other trades dealing specifically in the visual arts.&lt;ref name="prak241"&gt;Prak (2003): 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When trade between the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] resumed with the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in 1609, immigration increased and many Dutch cities reissued guild charters as a form of protection against the great number of paintings that began to cross the border.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; 

[[Image:Guild of Saint Luke.jpg|thumb|1730s engraving of the Delft Guild of St. Luke, by an unknown artist. Today the location of the [[Vermeer Centre]]]]
For example, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Delft]], all founded guilds between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; In each of those cases, panel painters removed themselves from their traditional guild structure that included other painters, such as those who worked in fresco and on houses, in favor of a specific "Guild of St. Luke".&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; On the other hand, these distinctions did not take effect at that time in Amsterdam or Haarlem.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; In the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]], however, a strict hierarchy was attempted in 1631 with panel painters at the top, though this hierarchy was eventually rejected.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt;  In the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] guild, also founded in 1611, the break was with the saddlemakers, but in 1644 a further split created a new painters' guild, leaving the guild of Saint Luke with only the sculptors and woodcarvers. A similar move in [[The Hague]] in 1656 led to the painters leaving the Guild of Saint Luke to establish a new ''[[Confrerie Pictura]]'' with all other kinds of visual artists, leaving the guild to the house-painters.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.66 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists in other cities were not successful in setting up their own guilds of St. Luke, and remained part of the existing guild structure (or lack thereof). For example, an attempt was made in [[Leiden]] to set up a guild in 1610 specifically for painters to protect themselves against the sale of art from foreigners, especially those from areas of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the area around [[Antwerp]]. However, the town, which traditionally resisted guilds in general, only offered to help them from illegal imports.&lt;ref name="montias93"&gt;Montias (1977): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1648 was a loosely organized "quasi-guild" permitted in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2003): 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guilds of the small but wealthy seat of government The Hague and its near neighbour, Delft, were constantly battling to stop the other's artists encroaching into their city, often without success.  By the later part of the century a kind of balance was achieved, with The Hague's portraitists supplying both cities, whilst Delft's genre painters did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
In [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] the Guild of St. Luke, ''per se'', did not exist. Painters belonged to the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries ("Arte dei Medici e Speziali") as they bought their pigments from the apothecaries, while sculptors were members of the Masters of Stone and Wood ("Maestri di Pietri e Legname).&lt;ref name="hughes3"&gt;Hughes (1986): 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also frequently members in the confraternity of St. Luke (''Compagnia di San Luca'')—which had been founded as early as 1349—although it was a separate entity from the guild system.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20; Jack (1976): 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were similar confraternal organizations in other parts of Italy, such as Rome.  By the 16th century a guild had even been established in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in [[Crete]], then a Venetian possession, by the very successful Greek artists of the [[Cretan School]]. In the sixteenth century, the ''Compagnia di San Luca'' began to meet at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|SS. Annunziata]], and sculptors, who had previously been members of a confraternity dedicated to St. Paul (''Compagnia di San Paolo''), also joined.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the ''compagnia'' developed into the Florentine [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia del Disegno]] in 1563, which was then formally incorporated into the city's guild system in 1572.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; The Florence example, in fact, eventually acted more like a traditional guild structure than the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; 

Founded by [[Federico Zuccari]] in 1593, Rome's Accademia reflects more clearly the "modern" notions of an artistic academy rather than perpetuating what has often been seen as the medieval nature of the guild system.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt;  Gradually other cities were to follow the example of Rome and the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] in [[Bologna]], with leading painters founding an "Academy", not always initially in direct competition with the local Guilds, but tending to eclipse and supplant it in time. This shift in artistic representation is generally associated with the modern conception of the visual arts as a liberal rather than mechanical art, and occurred in cities across Europe. In Antwerp [[David Teniers the Younger]] was both a dean of the Guild and founded the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy]], while in Venice [[Pittoni]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] led a breakaway [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Accademia]] from the old ''Fraglia dei Pittori'' as the local guild was known. The new academies began to offer training in drawing and the early stages of painting to students, and artistic theory, including the [[hierarchy of genres]], increased in importance.

==Guilds and intellectual pursuits==
[[File:Rhetoric-enthroned-invitation-antwerp-landjuweel-1561.jpg|thumb|Printed invitation to other [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] by the Antwerp ''[[Violieren]]'', for a ''landjuweel'' event, lasting 19 days, in 1561]]
The late sixteenth-century elevation of artist's status that occurred in Italy was echoed in the Low Countries by increased participation by artists in literary and humanistic societies. The Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, in particular, was closely associated with one of the city's eminent [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]], the ''[[Violieren]]'', and, in fact, the two were often discussed as being the same.&lt;ref name="gibson431"&gt;Gibson (1981): 431 (also n. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-sixteenth century, when [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] was active in the city, most of the members of the ''Violieren'', including [[Frans Floris]], [[Cornelis Floris]], and [[Hieronymus Cock]], were artists.&lt;ref name="gibson431" /&gt; The relationship between the two organizations, one for professionals practicing a trade and the other a literary and dramatist group, continued into the seventeenth century until the two groups formally merged in 1663 when the Antwerp Academy was founded a century after its Roman counterpart. Similar relationships between the Guild of St. Luke and chambers of rhetoric appear to have existed in Dutch cities in the seventeenth century. [[Haarlem|Haarlem's]] "Liefde boven al" ("Love above all") is a prime example, to which [[Frans Hals]], [[Esaias van de Velde]], and [[Adriaen Brouwer]] all belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner (1939): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities also manifested themselves in groups that developed outside of the guild like Antwerp's [[Guild of Romanists|Romanists]], for whom travel to Italy and appreciation of classical and humanist culture were essential.

==Guild rules==
[[File:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Judith Leyster]] self-portrait at 20, three years before she became the second woman to join the Haarlem Guild in 1633]]
Guild rules varied greatly. In common with the Guilds for other trades, there would be an initial [[apprentice]]ship of at least three, more often five years. Typically, the apprentice would then qualify as a "[[journeyman]]", free to work for any Guild member.  Some artists began to sign and date paintings a year or two before they reached the next stage, which often involved a payment to the Guild, and was to become a "[[Master craftsman|free Master]]".   After this the artist could sell his own works, set up his own workshop with apprentices of his own, and also sell the work of other artists.  [[Anthony van Dyck]] achieved this at eighteen, but in the twenties would be more typical.   

In some places the maximum number of apprentices was specified (as for example two), especially in the earlier periods, and alternatively a minimum of one might be specified.  In [[Nuremberg]] painting, unlike say goldsmithing, was a "free trade" without a Guild and regulated directly by the city council; this was intended to encourage growth in a city where much art was becoming linked with book [[publishing]], for which Nuremberg was the largest German centre.  Nonetheless there were rules and for example only married men could operate a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002): 105-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cities the women who were important members of workshops making [[illuminated manuscript]]s were excluded from the Guild or from being masters; however not in Antwerp, where [[Caterina van Hemessen]] and others were members.  As the Christian title of the Guild suggested, Jews were excluded, at least from becoming masters, in most cities.  

When [[printmaking]] arrived, many [[engraver]]s were from a [[goldsmith]]ing background and stayed in that guild.  As that link weakened with the development of printmaking, some painter' guilds accepted [[engraver]]s or [[etcher]]s who did not paint as Members, and others did not.  In London painters on glass had their own separate guild with the glaziers; elsewhere they would be accepted by the painters.

The rules of the Delft guild have been much puzzled over by art historians seeking to illuminate the undocumented training of [[Vermeer]].  When he joined the Guild there in 1653, he must have received six years training, according to the local rules. In addition, he had to pay a six guilders admission fee, despite the fact that his father was a Guild member (as an art dealer), which would normally have meant only a three guilder fee. This appears to mean that his training had not been received in Delft itself. [[Pieter de Hooch]] on the other hand, as an immigrant to Delft, had to pay twelve guilders in 1655, which he could not afford to pay all at once.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, pp. 166, 285n60, 160,&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the Guild rules is illustrated by the dispute between [[Frans Hals]] and [[Judith Leyster]] in Haarlem.  Leyster was the second woman in Haarlem to join the Guild, and probably trained with Hals - she was a witness at the [[baptism]] of his daughter.  Some years later, in 1635, she brought a dispute to the Guild complaining that one of her three apprentices had left her workshop after only a few days, and had been accepted into Hals' shop, in breach of Guild rules.  The Guild had the power to fine members, and after discovering that the apprentice had not been registered with them, fined both artists, and made a ruling on the apprentice's position.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the guilds==
All guild local monopolies came under general economic disapproval from the 17th century onwards; in the particular case of painters there was in many places a tension between the Guilds and artists imported as court painter by a ruler.  When [[Anthony van Dyck]] was finally enticed to come to England by King Charles I, he was provided with a house at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the boundary of the [[City of London]] to avoid the monopoly of the London guild.  [[The Hague]] with its Catholic court, split itself in two in 1656 with the [[Confrerie Pictura]]. By that time it was clear to all involved that the one-stop-shop concept of a guild was past its prime, and to ensure high quality and high prices, the education of artists needed to be separated from sales venues. Many towns set up ''academy'' style schools for education, while sales could be generated from arranged viewings at local inns, estate sales, or open markets.  In Antwerp the Habsburg Governors eventually removed the Guild's monopoly, and by the end of the 18th century hardly any guild monopolies survived, even before [[Napoleon]] disbanded all guilds in territories he controlled.  Guilds survived as societies or charitable organisations, or merged with the newer "[[Academy#Academies_of_the_arts|Academies]]" - as happened in Antwerp, but not in London or Paris.  Guild monopoly had a brief 20th century revival in Eastern Europe under [[Communism]], where non-members of the official artist's union or guild found it very hard to work as painters - for example the Czech [[Josef Váchal]].

==Paintings for the guilds==
In many cities the Guild of Saint Luke financed a chapel that was decorated with an altarpiece of their patron saint.&lt;ref name="olds"&gt;Olds (1990): 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier van der Weyden's]] ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]), one of the earliest-known paintings, set up a tradition that was followed by many subsequent artists.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; [[Jan Gossaert|Jan Gossaert's]] work in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]] (illustrated, top right) revisits Van der Weyden's composition while presenting the scene as a visionary experience instead of a directly witnessed portrait sitting.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; Later, [[Frans Floris]] (1556), [[Marten de Vos]] (1602) and [[Otto van Veen]] all represented the subject for the guild in Antwerp, and [[Abraham Janssens]] painted an altarpiece for the guild in [[Mechelen]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;King (1985): 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are frequently self-portraits with the artist as Luke, and often provide insight into artistic practices from the time when they were made since the subject is of an artist at work.

{{Sexual orientation}}
The '''heterosexual–homosexual continuum''' or the '''sexual orientation continuum''' is a psychological and philosophical understanding of human sexuality that places [[sexual orientation]] on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]] [[spectrum]] from [[heterosexuality]] to [[homosexual orientation|homosexuality]], with sexuality ranging from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.

This concept stems from [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s 1940s surveys of sexuality; significant numbers of Kinsey's subjects reported [[bisexuality]] of varying degrees, rather than the strict heterosexual/homosexual division that had been previously assumed. This work was expanded by [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]], who hypothesized that sexual orientation was a dynamic, multi-variable process, involving [[Attractiveness|attraction]], [[behavior]], [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]], emotional and [[social preferences]], [[self-identification]], and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="uis"&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.uis.edu/studentaffairs/safezone/resources/documents/Sexuality%20Continuum.pdf |title=Continuum of Human Sexuality |publisher=University of Illinois, Springfield |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110091528/http://www.uis.edu/studentaffairs/safezone/resources/documents/Sexuality%20Continuum.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This continuum was an important influence on the [[feminism|feminist]] and [[LGBT social movements|gay-rights]] movements of the 1970s and 1980s as academics and movement leaders tried to distinguish between one's sex—e.g. being male or female—and the social, cultural, and psychological aspects of gender and sexuality.

According to a 2005 statement by the [[American Psychological Association]]:
{{quote|Sexual orientation is an enduring emotional, romantic, sexual, or affectionate attraction toward others. It is easily distinguished from other components of sexuality including biological sex, [[gender identity]] (the psychological sense of being male or female), and the social [[gender role]] (adherence to cultural norms for feminine and masculine behavior).

Sexual orientation exists along a continuum that ranges from exclusive heterosexuality to exclusive homosexuality and includes various forms of [[bisexuality]].&lt;ref name=uis /&gt;}}

People who disagree with this interpretation of human sexual orientation are said to believe in a "heterosexual–homosexual dichotomy".&lt;ref&gt;McConaghy, Nathaniel. "Heterosexuality/homosexuality: Dichotomy or continuum." Archives of sexual behavior 16.5 (1987): 411-424.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hierarchy of genres''' is any formalization which ranks different  [[genre]]s in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.

In literature, the [[Epic poetry|epic]] was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Life of [[John Milton]]'': "By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions."  Below that came [[lyric poetry]], and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for [[drama]]. The [[novel]] took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the [[Baroque]] period, and [[opera]] retained a superior status for much longer.  The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century.  These were formalized and promoted by the [[Academy|academies]] in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]], which held a central role in [[Academic art]].  The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belton|first1=Dr. Robert J.|title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook|chapter=The Elements of Art|date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to "render visible the universal essence of things" (''imitare'' in Italian) and that which merely consisted of "mechanical copying of particular appearances" (''ritrarre'').&lt;ref&gt;Bass, 36 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TSDvkud168C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Hierarchy+of+genres+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idealism]] was privileged over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in line with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonist]] philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the [[High Renaissance]] onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art.  This had not been the case in [[Medieval art]] and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view.  The [[Raphael Cartoons]] are a clear example of the continuing status of [[tapestry]], the most expensive form of art in the 16th century.  In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century.  Until the 19th century the most extravagant [[objets d'art]] remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings.  Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==
The hierarchy grew out of the struggle  to gain acceptance of painting as one of the [[Liberal arts]], and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]].  These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]].  Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 28, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[De Pictura]]'' ("About Painting") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer.  He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of [[Michelangelo]], who was strongly influenced by [[neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 61, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of [[Mannerist]] theorists such as [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]] and [[Federico Zuccari]] (both also painters) this was far less of a priority.  Both emphasized beauty as "something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 140-141 (quote, 141)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status.  Ideas of [[decorum]] also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects.  For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the [[Medici]] in his [[Medici Chapel]] sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist [[Giovanni Battista Armenini|Armenini]]&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura'' (1587), " On the True Precepts of the Art of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1587 that "portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [''maniera''] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 23-24 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on art of the Council of Trent]] of 1563.  Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased.  Until the challenge of [[Caravaggio]] at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class.  Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by [[Karel van Mander]], [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' ( Rotterdam 1678), "Introduction to the Academy of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard de Lairesse]] and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Karel Dujardin]] and [[Vermeer]] produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell.  The unhappy history of [[Rembrandt]]'s last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life.  Often the different elements were painted by different artists; [[Rubens]] and [[Frans Snyders]] often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a ''landscape with...'', a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish [[world landscape]]s of [[Joachim Patinir]] in the early 16th century. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled.  For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of [[history painting]]; together they were the ''grand genre'', including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: [[Portrait painting|portraits]], scenes of everyday life (called ''scènes de genre'', or "[[Genre works|genre painting]]", and also ''petit genre'' to contrast it with the ''grande genre''), [[Landscape art|landscapes]], animal painting, and finally [[still life]]s. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. 

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes.  This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental ''[[The Young Bull]]'' of the Dutch artist [[Paulus Potter]], as well as the larger of the two ''[[Butchers' Shop]]'' canvases of [[Annibale Carracci]].  But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits.  Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later  dissenting theorists, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], held that this focus on [[allegory]] was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the [[Horace|Horatian]] dictum [[ut pictura poesis]] ("as is painting so is poetry").

The British painter [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: "Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of [[Virgil]], that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to [[Titian]]; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance."

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the [[Grand Manner]], where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] invented a genre that was called [[fêtes galantes]], where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. 

[[Claude Lorrain]] practised a genre called the [[ideal landscape]], where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a  setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term ''historical landscape'' which received official recognition in the Académie française when a [[Prix de Rome]] for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
[[Romanticism]] greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in [[British art]] and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the [[Style Troubadour]] in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American [[Hudson River School]] and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, [[women artists|women]] were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to [[history painting]], which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy.  In Britain the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts.  Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects.  New artistic movements included the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

The '''internal consistency of the Bible''' concerns the coherence and textual integrity of the [[Bible]]. Disputes regarding biblical consistency have a long history.&lt;!--Summary evidences in article, no source needed!--&gt;

Classic texts that discuss questions of inconsistency from a critical secular perspective include the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'' by [[Baruch Spinoza]], the ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' of [[Voltaire]], the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' by [[Thomas Paine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paine | first = Thomas | authorlink = Thomas Paine | title = Writings of Thomas Paine — Volume 4 (1794–1796): the Age of Reason by Paine | publisher = Project Gutenberg | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3743 | accessdate = 2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency==
{{See also|Biblical inerrancy}}
For many believers, the internal consistency of the Jewish and Christian scriptures is important because they feel that any inconsistencies or contradictions could challenge belief in truth of their contents and the view that they are of divine origin.{{cn|date=August 2018}} On the subject of the Jewish text, B. Barry Levy writes about the [[Torah]] that "the textual integrity of every biblical book should be extremely important to those interested in either the [[Hebrew Bible]] or classical Jewish thought". Levy also writes that "Despite the popular, pious-sounding assumption that the Torah text is letter-perfect, frequent and extensive discussions by highly respected [[rabbinic]] leaders demonstrate that they, in some measure similar to modern scholars, were concerned about its true textual state; some of them even tried to clarify known textual doubts and to eliminate many troublesome inconsistencies."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the modern writer Joshua Golding states that even though it contains inconsistencies, this "does not imply that God did not reveal the Torah".&lt;ref&gt;Golding, JL., ''Rationality and Religious Theism'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p.106
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Christian evangelists [[John Ankerberg]] and [[Dillon Burroughs]] state that "the Bible's teachings, if perfect, must be consistent with one another" and that "the Bible is consistent with itself from beginning to end".&lt;ref&gt;Ankerberg, J. and Burroughs, D., ''Taking a Stand for the Bible: Today's Leading Experts Answer Critical Questions about God's Word'', Harvest House Publishers, 2009, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Catholic writers have argued that "If we believe the Scriptures are divinely inspired, we must also believe them to be internally coherent".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, S., and Mitch, C., ''Ignatius Catholic Study Bible: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon'', Ignatius Press, 2013, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor [[Erwin Lutzer]] argues that the Bible is consistent in asserting that it is the word of God, and that this is a reason for accepting that it is of divine origin: "The sixty-six books speak with a consistent voice that these are the words of God".&lt;ref&gt;Lutzer, EW., ''Seven Reasons Why You Can Trust the Bible'', Moody Publishers, 2008, pp. 16 &amp; 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of traditional Jewish and Christian belief have also argued that inconsistencies undermine the value of scripture. The [[deist]] minister [[Joseph Barker (minister)|Joseph Barker]], speaking in 1854, described the Bible as "the most inconsistent, the most monstrous and blasphemous representations of God that can possibly be conceived by the human mind" and argued that "The book that contradicts science and contradicts itself is a book of no authority whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Hartford Bible Convention'', Partridge &amp; Brittan, 1854, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern Islamic critic writes that if the Bible can be shown to be inconsistent, "then those who preach the Bible and read the Bible must seriously reconsider their source of information concerning their faith."&lt;ref&gt;Rashad Abdul Mahaimin, ''Jesus and the Bible'', Islamic Books, 2003, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

One response to this kind of criticism is to argue that no inconsistencies exist. As theologian [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] explains, some Christians read the Bible with the assumption that "Scripture is ''self-consistent''", and that if there appear to be contradictions between two texts, they believe that "more careful reading is required to show that they really cohere". Barton states that "this is not the Bible that we have in fact got". He also points out that Judaism understands that texts "may sometimes be in dialogue with each other" and "something positive may emerge from a kind of creative tension".&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J., ''The Bible: The Basics'', Routledge, 2010. pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christian writers, however, while agreeing that inaccuracies and inconsistencies occur, argue that these do not necessarily make the Bible false&lt;ref&gt;Giles, T., ''A Doubter's Guide to the Bible'', Abingdon Press, 2010, Ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is no longer desirable to try to [[Gospel harmony|harmonize all four Gospels into "one consistent account"]], because "we have learned that each of the four Gospels has its own ... unique image of Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, JD. and Garvey, SJ., ''Why a Church Catholic?'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randel Helms]] argues that the books of the Bible were written for and against different points of view—that the Bible's authors were often motivated to write because they wanted to challenge or correct those who had written before them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helms |first=Randel |authorlink= |title=The Bible Against Itself: Why the Bible Seems to Contradict Itself |accessdate= |year=2006  |publisher=Millennium Press |location= |isbn=0-9655047-5-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMqWPAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Bible+against+itself&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV09XX-KTJAhXDGz4KHSukBcEQ6AEIHDAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
{{See also|Biblical inerrancy|Divine inspiration}}

===Jewish===
The [[Torah]] is viewed by some as the literal word of God, [[Mosaic authorship|dictated to Moses]]. According to the 12th-century Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]], "The Torah that we have today is the one dictated to Moses by God".&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Commentary on Mishnah, Sanhedrin 11:1, Article 8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neviim|Prophets]], such as [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Jonah]], are said to have heard and reported the word of God,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Isaacs, RH., ''Messengers of God: A Jewish Prophets Who's who'', Jason Aronson, 1998, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Kethuvim|Writings]] (the category that includes books such as [[Psalms]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] and [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]]) "were excluded from the prophetic collection because their inspiration appeared to be human rather than Divine".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 3, pp. 577–578.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "In the broadest sense, the Scriptures taken as a whole, and subsequently the totality of Jewish spiritual teaching, fall within the connotation of God's word."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 21, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern Jewish scholars have an accommodating view of the nature of the Torah, not necessarily viewing it as strictly internally consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "One aspect of narrative in Genesis that requires special attention is its high tolerance for different versions of the same event, a well-known feature of ancient Near Eastern literature, from earliest times through rabbinic midrash. ... This could not have happened if the existence of variation were seen as a serious defect or if rigid consistency were deemed essential to effective storytelling."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian===

[[Justin Martyr]], a 2nd-century Christian writer, declared the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] generally preferred in the early Church, to be "completely free of errors".&lt;ref&gt;Hengel, M.,
The Septuagint as a Collection of Writings Claimed by Christians:

B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1992, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote that "the author of Holy Scripture is God".&lt;ref&gt;"Quod auctor sacrae Scripturae est Deus". [[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/st_q1.html Article 10].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1646) asserts that the Bible's authority depends "wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God".&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], Chapter I, Paragraph iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups, such as the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches follow the Jewish practice of describing certain books as [[apocrypha]] (although not all churches regard the same list of books as apocryphal, see also [[biblical apocrypha]]).

Assertions that the Bible contains inconsistencies contradicts [[Martin Luther]]'s statement that "God cannot lie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtio.com/articles/bissar37.htm |title="Lessons from Luther on the Inerrancy of Holy Writ" Luther, Martin. '&amp;#39;Weimarer Ausgabe'&amp;#39; 10 III, 162 |publisher=Mtio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther accepted that mistakes and inconsistencies existed, but concluded that they did not necessarily undermine the truth of the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

German Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]] took a different view, proposing in ''Harmonia evangelica'' (1537) a number of attempted [[Gospel harmony|harmonisations]], including the suggestion that Jesus must have been [[Crown of Thorns|crowned with thorns]] twice, and that there were three separate episodes of [[Jesus and the money changers|cleansing of the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) p. 8; [[John S. Kloppenborg|John S. Kloppenborg Verbin]], "Is There a New Paradigm?", in Horrell, Tuckett (eds), ''Christology, Controversy, and Community: New Testament Essays in Honour of David R. Catchpole'' (BRILL, 2000), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Christian approaches to biblical consistency are reminiscent of the split between Luther and Osiander, and can be broadly divided between [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] and [[biblical infallibility|infallibility]]. The former, followed by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and by [[evangelical Christians]] in the United States in general, holds that the original [[biblical manuscript]]s have "God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter", so that "all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp |title=The Baptist Faith and Message, I. The Scriptures |publisher=Sbc.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gleason Archer]], whose reconciliation of difficult texts echoes that of Osiander, allow that textual scholarship and an understanding of the historical context of individual passages is necessary to establish true, original biblical text, but that that text, once discovered, is without error.

The infallibility approach followed by some theologians and scholars, primarily of the Catholic and Anglican churches, and some mainline Protestant denominations, avoids many of the pitfalls of inerrancy by holding that the Bible is without error only in matters essential to salvation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|year=1989|publisher=Pearson|pages=1023–1033|author=Raymond F Collins|edition=1st|editor=Raymond Brown |editor2=Joseph Fitzmyer |editor3=Roland Murphy (Eds.)|chapter=Essay 65: "Inspiration", 65:29–50, pp. 1029f}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that guidance is necessary for the correct interpretation of apparent inconsistencies; the latter part being common to all Orthodox and Catholic Christians, regardless of views of biblical inerrancy, being the primary role of the [[magisterium]].

According to Roman Catholic biblical scholar [[Raymond E. Brown]], this approach found expression in ''[[Dei verbum]]'', one of the key documents adopted at the [[Second Vatican Council]], which stated that scripture teaches "solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm ''Dei verbum'', Chapter III, from the Catechism of the Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that Scripture is [[biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] only "to the extent to which it conforms to the salvific purpose of God,"&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Brown, ''The Critical Meaning of the Bible'', Paulist Press (1981), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent P. Branick, ''Understanding the New Testament and Its Message: An Introduction'', (Paulist Press, 1998), p. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; without necessarily being reliable on matters such as paleontology or political history; this view is challenged by some conservative Catholic scholars.&lt;ref name="JI"&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|year=1989|publisher=Pearson|pages=1023–1033|author=Raymond F Collins|edition=1st|editor=Raymond Brown |editor2=Joseph Fitzmyer |editor3=Roland Murphy (Eds.)|chapter=Essay 65: "Inspiration"|quote="Clearly, Vatican II intended to recapitulate traditional teaching on inspiration....In this regard, Vatican II's statement on inspiration concurs with the views of many evangelical Christians."

===Muslim===
In the Middle Ages, [[Ulema|Muslim scholars]] such as [[Ibn Hazm]], [[al-Qurtubi]], [[al-Maqrizi]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], and [[Ibn al-Qayyim]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Izhar ul-Haqq]], Ch. 1 Sect. 4 titled ([[s:ar:إظهار الحق/القول في التوراة والإنجيل|القول في التوراة والإنجيل]]).&lt;/ref&gt; based on their interpretation of [[Quran]]ic and other traditions,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]'s explication of [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]'s&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] had tampered with the scriptures, a concept known as ''[[tahrif]]''.

The theme of ''tahrif'' was first explored in the writings of Ibn Hazm (10th century), who rejected claims of [[Mosaic authorship]] and posited that [[Ezra]] was the author of the Torah. His arguments against the authenticity of the biblical text in both the [[Tanakh]] and New Testament included chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; what he considered theological impossibilities ([[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] expressions, stories of [[extramarital sex]], and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as what he saw as a lack of reliable transmission (''[[tawatur]]'') of the text. He argued that the falsification of the Torah could have taken place while there existed only one copy kept by the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Ibn Hazm's arguments had a major impact upon Muslim literature and scholars, and these and other [[polemic]]al ideas were modified only slightly by some later authors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', BRILL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Power in the Portrayal: Representations of Jews and Muslims in Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century'', chapter "An Andalusi-Muslim Literary Typology of Jewish Heresy and Sedition", pp. 56 and further, Tahrif: p. 58, {{ISBN|0-691-00187-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Under Crescent and Cross'': The Jews in the Middle Ages, p. 146, {{ISBN|0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Layth, Ibn Rabban, and [[Ibn Qutayba]], found that there had been no corruption of the text but denounced as ''tahrif'' what they considered misleading interpretations of the text.&lt;ref name="Adang1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Camilla Adang|title=Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible: From Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4Ut1MjLQTMC&amp;pg=PA223|date=1 January 1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10034-3|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th-century commentator [[Ibn Khaldun]] argued in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (Introduction) that no distortion had taken place: "the statement concerning the alteration is unacceptable to thorough scholars and cannot be understood in its plain meaning".&lt;ref name="Sawyer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=John F.

==Biblical criticism and criticism of the Bible==
{{Main|Biblical criticism|Criticism of the Bible}}
The study of inconsistencies in the Bible has a long history. In the 17th century, [[Spinoza]] considered the Bible to be, "...a book rich in contradictions."&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, L., ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity: Essays and Lectures in Modern Jewish Thought'', SUNY Press, 1997, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, [[Thomas Paine]] in [[The Age of Reason]] compiled many of the Bible's self-contradictions. And in 1860, William Henry Burr produced a list of 144 self-contradictions in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, WH., ''Self-Contradictions of the Bible'', 1860, reprinted Library of Alexandria, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biblical studies|Biblical scholars]] have studied inconsistencies in and between texts and canons as a means to study the bible and the societies that created and influenced it. The field has been given rise to theories such as [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s&lt;ref&gt;
Wellhausen, J., ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel: With a Reprint of the Article 'Israel' from the Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1885. reprinted Cambridge University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[documentary hypothesis]] and the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic history|deuteronomistic history]] (concerning the origins of the Torah and the history of Israel contained in the books from [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] to [[Books of Kings|Kings]] respectively),&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, SL., ''The trouble with Kings: the composition of the book of Kings in the Deuteronomistic history'', Supplements to Vetus testamentum, Brill, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and similar theories to explain why the [[Synoptic Gospels]] disagree with each other, and with the [[Gospel of John]].

===Biblical canons===
{{See also|Biblical canon|Development of the Christian Biblical canon|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}
The question of inconsistency covers not only the text but even the composition of scripture. Since the Bible never enumerates its own component parts, those who believe it is inerrant must appeal to extra-biblical authority to justify which books to include.&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Taylor, ''The Faith of a Moralist'' (Macmillan, London, 1930) II, p. 209; quoted in Brand Blanchard, ''Reason and Belief'' (Allen and Unwin, 1974), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, different communities have accepted shifting collections of books. The size of these [[biblical canon]]s varies enormously, from the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritans]], who consider the five books of the [[Torah]] alone to be authoritative,&lt;ref&gt;The Pentateuch, or Torah, is the first five books of the bible - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Ethiopian Bible]], which contains all the books of all other churches plus such titles as the [[Josippon|Book of Josephus]] and the [[First Epistle of Clement|Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The contents of canons have varied over time, books regarded as authoritative by some Christians at some points in history being excluded from the collections of later communities—this was the fate of the [[List of gospels|many apocryphal Gospels]] from the first few centuries of the Church (the [[Gospel of Thomas]] is a famous example); books long regarded as canonical in one branch of Christianity may be dropped by others on doctrinal grounds (the fate of the [[deuterocanonical books]], canonical in the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] but repudiated by the Protestants because they are not included in the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;"More Than One Bible." Christian History, issue 43, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and supported doctrines to which the [[Protestant reformation|Protestant reformers]] objected such as the [[intercession of saints]], [[purgatory]], [[prayers for the dead]] etc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA42 |title=Mercer dictionary of the Bible |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09|isbn=9780865543737|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo8csizDv0gC&amp;pg=PA163 |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1995-02-13 |accessdate=2012-10-09|isbn=9780802837813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some books that could have been included, such as the [[Book of Enoch]], quoted as scriptural in {{bibleverse||Jude|1:14-15|KJV}}, were excluded from the canons of almost all later communities (see [[Book of Enoch#Canonicity|Canonicity of the Book of Enoch]]).

===Attribution of the books===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Bible}}
The question of internal consistency in the Bible also involves the attribution of authorship to its books. For instance, the words of the Torah, or the first five books of the Old Testament, have traditionally been believed to be by the hand of [[Moses]], and the New Testament Gospels have been attributed to the [[Four Evangelists]]. Modern scholarship calls these attributions into question.

Eliot Rabin writes: "For the past 400 years, readers have been openly questioning the traditional attribution of these five books to Moses."&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, E., ''Understanding the Hebrew Bible: A Reader's Guide'', KTAV Publishing House, 2006, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he quotes [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his 1651 [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] as writing that, when Genesis 12:6 has "and the Canaanite was then in the land", it could not have been written by Moses. Hobbes may have been the first European to question this attribution in print, arguing that the words can "only sensibly be used by someone who is writing when the Canaanites no longer are in the land ... But the Canaanites were in the land when Moses was alive."&lt;ref&gt;Martinich AP., ''The Two Gods of Leviathan: Thomas Hobbes on Religion and Politics'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin also quotes the 11th-century rabbi, [[Rashi]], as saying that Moses could not have written, in Deuteronomy 34:5, "And Moses died there", but it must have been written by [[Joshua]]. However, it is also noted that the second-century commentator [[Rabbi Meir]], has it that God dictated those words to Moses, who wrote them down with a tear in his eye.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, E., ''Understanding the Hebrew Bible: A Reader's Guide'', KTAV Publishing House, 2006, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In none of the four [[Gospels]] does the text say that a particular book is written by the evangelist who is attributed as its author. Writers such as M. N. Ralph say that in reading the Gospels one will be struck by "a great deal of evidence" that they are compilations inherited from written and oral sources "rather than eyewitness accounts". So scholars conclude that the attributions are "not to the person who compiled it."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, MN., ''A Walk Through the New Testament: An Introduction for Catholics'', Paulist Press, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscripts===
{{Further information|Biblical manuscript|Textual criticism}}
Manuscripts also differ. Usually the differences are minor—matters of spelling and the like—but occasionally they are significant, as in the case of the [[Comma Johanneum]], a clause in the [[First Epistle of John]] that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian [[Trinity]], but is not found in any manuscript earlier than the 10th century (codex 221), where it is shown as a marginal note.&lt;ref name=DBWallace&gt;Daniel B. Wallace,"[http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1185 The Comma Johanneum and Cyprian]".&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example from the Old Testament is the difference between the [[Septuagint]] and [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] descriptions of the battle of [[David]] and [[Goliath]]: the Septuagint version is shorter and avoids the narrative inconsistencies of the familiar Masoretic story, notably the famous incident of [[Saul]] asking who David is as though he does not know his own harpist and shield-bearer.

There are also important differences between the Masoretic and [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan]] version of the [[Pentateuch]] in the readings of many sentences. Some distinctions seem motivated by (or reflect) actual philosophical differences between [[Judaism]] and [[Samaritanism]]. Some of these are glaringly obvious, like the inclusion of a passage in the Samaritan version of the [[Ten Commandments]] that restates the command to build an altar on [[Mount Gerizim]], and says plainly that Mount Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered. Since the location of God's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism, it makes sense that this passage is in one version and not the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.meson.org/religion/torahcompare.php |title=The Samaritan Pentateuch |publisher=Web.meson.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contradictions===
Most questions of Biblical inconsistency relate to contradictions in the narrative. Some relate to apparently minor details, for example: the number of soldiers in an army (e.g. {{bibleverse|1|Chron.|21:5|niv}} vs. {{bibleverse|2|Sam.|24:9|niv}}), the year a certain king began his reign (e.g. {{bibleverse|2|Chron.|36:9|kjv}} vs. {{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:8|kjv}}), the details of [[Apostle Paul]]'s itinerary (Acts 9,11,15,18:22,21 vs. Galatians 1:18,2:1). In some cases, seemingly trivial points of differences can actually have an enormous significance for the interpretation of a book or for the reconstruction of the history of Ancient Israel, how the world was created, why God allows suffering, or the religious significance of Jesus' death.&lt;ref&gt;

And then there are instances that involve major issues, where one author has one point of view on an important topic  (How was the world created? Why do the people of God suffer? What is the significance of Jesus’ death?), and another author has another."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars find inconsistencies in the Old Testament and Torah and ascribe many of them to the process by which they were created. For example, the [[documentary hypothesis]] asserts that repetitions and contradictions are the result of texts that have been woven together from diverse sources written by different authors, at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Brettler|2004|pp=3–5}} "Slowly, with the rise of rationalism, particularly as associated with figures such as Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) and especially Benedict (Baruch) Spinoza (1632-1677), the view that the Torah was a unified whole, written by Moses, began to be questioned. ... This culminated in the development of the models of the Documentary Hypothesis in the 19th century, according to which the Torah (or Hexateuch) is composed of four main sources or documents which were edited or redacted together: J, E, P, and D. Each of these sources or documents is embedded in a (relatively) complete form in the current Torah, and is typified by vocabulary, literary style, and theological principles."&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Jensen wrote, "no better explanation has as yet been found of the complexities of composition of the [[Pentateuch]], and it continues to command a good consensus among scholars".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jensen, ''God's Word to Israel'', Liturgical Press (September 1982), p. 36. {{ISBN|0-8146-5289-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this point, Ronald Witherup gives the example of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1-2, which most scholars view as two separate stories of creation written by different authors in different time periods. "Most biblical scholars accept Genesis 1 as originating around the sixth century B.C. with a group of scribes who were concerned about the preservation of the liturgical traditions of the Jews (thus the concern for the seven-day schema of creation and the notion of the sabbath). Genesis 2, on the other hand, originates from an earlier, more primitive tradition dated to around the tenth century B.C." Fundamentalists argue that this is simply the same story told twice, the first time (Gen 1:1-2:4) being poetic and the second one (Gen 2:4-25) being more anthropomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Witherup, ''Biblical Fundamentalism: What Every Catholic Should Know'', Liturgical Press (2001), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are further examples of other types of inconsistency in the Old Testament. In the account of the slaughtering of an animal before the Temple, it states that the animal: "was killed at the entrance to the tabernacle, north of the altar, and cut up." The most natural interpretation of the Hebrew wording is that the slaughtering was done by the one making the offering rather than by the priest. If so, it contradicts Ezek 44:11, where it is done by the Levites, and 2 Chr 29:22, 24 where done by the priests.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several places in the Old Testament where numerical figures can be directly compared. For example, both {{bibleref2|Ezra|2:1–65|NIV}} and {{bibleref2|Nehemiah|7:6–67|NIV}} present the list of Jewish families that "came up out of [[Babylonian captivity|the captivity of the exiles]] ... and returned to Jerusalem and Judah". But the two lists disagree on the number of members of each family. In total, there are nearly ''twenty'' numerical discrepancies between the lists.&lt;ref&gt;The discrepancies occur in the following families: Arah, Pahath-Moab (through the line of Jeshua and Joab), Zattu, Bani, Bebai, Azgad, Adonikam, Bigvai, Adin, Bezai, Hashum, Bethlehem (and Netophah), Bethel (and Ai), Magbish, Lod (and Hadid and Ono), Senaah, Asaph, Shallum (and Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita and Shobai), Delaiah (and Tobiah and Nekoda), and the singers.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in both cases a total figure of 42,360 people is given,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Ezra|2:64|NASB}}; {{bibleverse|Nehemiah|7:66|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the partial figures do not add up to the total.&lt;ref&gt;Oded Lipschitz, Joseph Blenkinsopp, ''Judah and the Judeans in the Neo-Babylonian Period'', (Eisenbrauns, 2003) p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; A third version of the list exists in the apocryphal book [[1 Esdras]].

In Deuteronomy chapter 4, verses 1 and 8 state that Moses is about to teach the laws "today". Verse 8, in the Hebrew text, even says that the "entire Torah" is to be taught today. However, verse 5 suggests that the laws have already been delivered some time in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, T., in Schipper, B. and Teeter DA. ''Wisdom and Torah: The Reception of ‘Torah’ in the Wisdom Literature of the Second Temple Period'', BRILL, 2013, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oxford Bible Commentary'' notes that:
{{quote|as has long been recognized, there remain a number of variations or inconsistencies of detail, which suggests that two or more accounts have been combined. In particular, the creative acts are introduced in different ways. While in some cases God creates simply by speaking ("And God said..."), in others we are told that he performed certain actions: he made, separated, named, blessed, placed.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, orthodox rabbis, such as [[Mordechai Breuer]] deny that such inconsistencies are evidence that the words were not all created by God. He asserts that such hypotheses are false, and that the contradictory portrayals of creation are not because they were written by different authors. "Instead we refer them to the different qualities of God."&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, M., The study of the Bible and fear of Heaven, in Carmy, S. (ed), ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996, pp.159-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal consistency of the text===
Jewish scholars are concerned that all copies of the [[Torah]] are identical, and that each copy is consistent in its statements and in its language. The aim is to preserve the work in a condition as close to its original state as possible. This extends to consistency in spelling and the use of individual words.

B. Barry Levy notes that the 16th-century [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|Rabbi Ibn Zimra]] recounted "how he restored the scrolls to their original state" and noted "the importance of having textual consistency in the scrolls, because criticisms of how Jews preserved and transmitted the Torah text contained accusations that they willfully changed it."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Levy also suggests that "Torah scrolls remain prized and frequently used ritual objects, and scribes have continually worked as carefully as possible to copy them, always holding dear the belief that they were producing as accurate and correct a text as they could. Unfortunately even this commitment and care could not guarantee a letter-perfect text".&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Shnayer Leiman writes that, "Errors have crept into the best Torah scrolls. Every so often a Torah has to be returned to the ark due to an error discovered while being read in public."&lt;ref&gt;Leiman, SZ., Response to Rabbi Brewer, in Carmy, S. (ed), ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several grammatical errors are known to appear in copies of the Torah. As Shai Cherry notes, "Since one of the Rabbinic assumptions is that the Torah is perfect, at a minimum one would expect there to be no grammatical mistakes. After all, shouldn't God be an inerrant grammarian?" For examples of such mistakes, Cherry notes that, in the Cain and Abel story, where 'sin' is mentioned, "''sin (chatat)'' is feminine, but the predicate is masculine." Rabbis have suggested that this is because sin starts out weak like a woman, but ends as strong as a man. Also, in verse 7 of this story, which concerns 'daughters' so that all four suffixes should be feminine, two of them are masculine. Cherry says that such problems ought to be ascribed to "sloppy editing," but that those who believe the Torah is perfect, would say that these errors were put there intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, S., ''Torah Through Time: Understanding Bible Commentary from the Rabbinic Period to Modern Times'', Jewish Publication Society, 2010, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
Christian theologians agree that the New Testament has a single and consistent theological focus on the salvific nature of Christ, but the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament consists of several different theologies. Some of these complement each other, while others are contradictory, even within the same book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolf P. Knierim]], ''The Task of Old Testament Theology'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995), p. 1; Isaac Kalimi, "The Task of Hebrew Bible/ Old Testament Theology - Between Judaism and Christianity" in Wonil Kim, ''Reading the Hebrew Bible for a New Millennium'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of a single unifying theology, common themes recur, including (although no list can be exhaustive) [[monotheism]], the divine origins of human morality, God's election of a chosen people, the idea of the coming [[Messiah]], and the concepts of [[sin]], faithfulness, and [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. The study of these is central to both Jewish and Christian theologies, even if they differ in their approaches. For example, although both religions believe in the coming Messiah, the Jewish expectation is different from the Christian view.

Within Christianity, themes such as the nature of God ([[trinitarianism]] and [[nontrinitarianism]]),&lt;ref&gt;God as Communion By Patricia A. Fox, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christology|nature of Jesus]], [[Christian views on the Old Covenant|views of the old covenant]], [[original sin]], [[predestination]], [[ordination of women]], [[Hell in Christianity|hell]], [[Christian eschatological differences|biblical prophecies]], etc. have continued to be a matter of dispute among theologians and [[Religious denomination|various denominations]].

===New Testament===
{{main article|Textual criticism#New Testament}}
The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th century CE [[Alexandrian text-type]]; the [[Western text-type]], also very early but prone to paraphrase and other corruptions; and the [[Byzantine text-type]], which makes up above 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition. Scholars regard the Alexandrian text-type as generally more authoritative when treating [[textual criticism|textual variations]]. The majority of differences are minor—matters such as variant spellings&lt;ref&gt;K. Aland and B. Aland, "The Text Of The New Testament: An Introduction To The Critical Editions &amp; To The Theory &amp; Practice Of Modern Text Criticism", Wm. B.

Scholars such as [[Bart Ehrman]] have speculated that [[John 21]] was appended to the gospel at a later date&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman; [[Misquoting Jesus]], 166&lt;/ref&gt;, but no manuscript evidence for this assertion has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;

All major modern Christian communions accept a uniform canon of 27 books, although a few small and isolated communities have either fewer or more. Nevertheless, the idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic times]] has no foundation in history, and the [[canon of the New Testament]], like that of the Old, is the [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|result of a historical process]]. The very idea of a closed canon did not exist prior to the 2nd century, when it became necessary to counter movements such as [[Marcionism]]. By the end of the 4th century unanimity had been achieved in the West concerning the New Testament canon as it is today, and by the 5th century most of the East had come into harmony by accepting the Book of Revelation. Nonetheless, a full dogmatic articulation of the canon for Roman Catholicism was not made until the [[Council of Trent]] of 1546, as until then the authority of the Scriptures was not considered higher than that of Sacred Tradition, papal bulls, and ecumenical councils. Martin Luther revived the [[antilegomena]] dispute by suggesting the removal of Jude, James, Hebrews, and Revelation; this was not generally accepted by his followers, but these books are still ordered last in the German-language Luther Bible. The canons of other important communions were defined in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Presbyterianism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for the [[Greek Orthodox]].

====Internal consistency====
Biblical scholar [[Bruce M. Metzger]] mentions several internal inconsistencies in the New Testament in earlier manuscripts that later scribes attempted to correct:&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
In the earlier manuscripts of Mark 1:2, the composite quotation from Malachi 3:1 and Isaiah 40:3 is introduced by the formula "As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet". Later scribes, sensing this involves a difficulty replaced "As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet" with the general statement "As it is written in the prophets". Since the quotation Matthew(27:9) attributes to the prophet Jeremiah actually comes from Zechariah(11:12f), it is not surprising that some scribes sought to mend the error either by substituting the correct name or by omitting the name altogether. A few scribes attempted to harmonize the Johannine account of the chronology of the Passion with that in Mark by changing ’sixth hour’ of John 19:14 to ‘third hour’ (which appears in Mark 15:25). At John 1:28, [[Origen]] altered [[Bethany (Jerusalem)|Bethany]] to [[Bethabara]] in order to remove what he regarded as a geographical difficulty, and this reading is extant today in [[Manuscripts|MSS]]. 33 69 and many others, including those behind the [[King James version]]. The statement in Mark 8:31, that ‘the Son of man must suffer many things…and be killed and after three days rise again’, seems to involve a chronological difficulty, and some copyists changed the phrase to the more familiar expression, ‘on the third day’. The author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] places the golden [[altar of incense]] in the [[Holy of Holies]] (Heb. 9:4), which is contrary to the Old Testament description of the [[Tabernacle]] (Exod. 30:1-6). The scribe of [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and the translator of the Ethiopic version correct the account by transferring the words to 9:2, where the furniture of the [[Hekhal|Holy Place]] is itemized.}}

In the 2nd century CE, [[Tatian]] produced a gospel text called [[Diatessaron]] by weaving together all four gospels into one. The gospel compilation eliminated all the discrepancies that exist between the four gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Encountering the Manuscripts By Philip Wesley Comfort, Philip Comfort&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it omits the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogies of Jesus]] in Matthew and Luke. To fit in all canonical material, Tatian created his own narrative sequence, which is different from both the synoptic sequence and John's sequence.

====The Gospels====
{{See also|Historicity of the canonical Gospels}}
The problem of there being possible contradictions in the Gospels is of importance to Christians. As [[Francis Watson (priest)|Francis Watson]] writes: "The problem cannot be resolved by observing that the alleged contradictions are trivial ... [They] are far from trivial [and] there are very many of them, and they often relate to issues at the heart of the Christian faith and life."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, F., ''Gospel Writing: A Canonical Perspective'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2013, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Origen]] (184/185 – 253/254 [[Common Era|CE]]&lt;ref&gt;''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Detroit: Gale, 2003). {{ISBN|978-0-7876-4004-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) replied to the writer [[Celsus]], a critic of Christianity, who had complained that some Christians had remodelled the [[Gospel]] to answer objections, agreeing that some had done so.&lt;ref name=Origen /&gt;  However, he stated that he did not believe the problem was widespread, nor did he approve of the practice, further stating that he believed that those making the alternations introduced "heresies opposed to the meaning of the doctrine of Jesus".&lt;ref name=Origen&gt;{{cite web|author=Origen|title = Contra Celsus, Book II, Chapter XXVII|url = http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen162.html|accessdate = 2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Harmony of the Gospels (Augustine)|Harmony of the Gospels]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo]] produced a 5th-century attempt to explain away all of the apparent contradictions he was aware of.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, A. and Cavadini, JC., ''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999, p. 132 {{ISBN|0-8028-3843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that because there are those who would "rob [the Evangelists] of their credit as veracious historians", "we must prove that the writers in question do not stand in any antagonism to each other."&lt;ref&gt;

St. Augustine of Hippo, in ''The Harmony Of The Gospels (Extended Annotated Edition)'', Jazzybee Verlag, 2012, Chapter VII.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas more modern apologists, such as [[Gleason Archer]], in producing a book that provides explanations for many Bible difficulties, writes: "Be fully persuaded in your own mind that an adequate explanation exists, even though you have not yet found it."&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Gleason L., "Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of those who accept that there are inconsistencies, scholars such as [[Raymond E. Brown|Raymond Brown]] have examined contradictions in the Gospels, particularly in the [[infancy narrative]]s of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E.

P. Sanders, 'Jesus from the Jewish point of view', in ''The Cambridge History of Judaism'' ed William Horbury, vol 3: the Early Roman Period, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; More critical scholars see the nativity stories either as completely fictional accounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Sanders | first=Ed Parish | authorlink=E.

As a further example, the "[[Markan Appendix]]" "is universally accepted to have not been written by the author",&lt;ref&gt;Nave, DN., ''The Role and Function of Repentance in Luke-Acts'',BRILL, 2002 p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Mark 16:9-20 was added later so that the Gospel of Mark originally ended at [[Mark 16#Mark 16:9–20 in the manuscript tradition|Mark 16:8]].&lt;ref&gt;The role and function of repentance in Luke-Acts, by Guy D.

[[Historical-grammatical method|Grammatico-historical]] [[exegesis]] is determining the meaning of scripture by understanding the author's environment outside the Bible, as well as the scripture itself.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=France/&gt; --&gt; [[R.T. France|R. T. France]] states this form of exegesis involves the "fullest possible use of linguistic, literary, historical, archaeological, and other data bearing on that author's environment".&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=France/&gt; --&gt;

France, regarding the "distinctive contribution" of each of the four gospels, commented, "In accepting that God intended his church to have four Gospels, not just one, Christians have also recognized that each has something different to say about Jesus. It is only after we have listened to each in its individuality that we can hope to gain the full richness which comes from the 'stereoscopic' vision of Jesus as seen through four different pairs of eyes!"&lt;ref name=France2&gt;France, R.T., [[Tyndale New Testament Commentaries]]: Matthew, Inter-Varsity Press, Leicester, England (1985), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[two-source hypothesis]] remains the most popular explanation for the origins of the synoptic gospels: according to this, there are two sources, the Gospel of Mark and a lost, hypothetical sayings collection called [[Q Document|Q]] (''see also, [[Two-source hypothesis#Other hypotheses|other hypotheses]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, RL., ''Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels'',Kregel Academic, 2002, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Two-source Hypothesis is not without [[Two-source hypothesis#Problems with the hypothesis|its problems]].

====Examples====
A wide variety of inconsistencies have been suggested both within the New Testament and between the New Testament and the Hebrew scriptures. These fall into a number of broad categories. The more prominent are identified and discussed below, with examples.

=====Gospels=====
{{see also|Historical reliability of the Gospels|Gospel harmony}}
Internal consistency within the [[synoptic gospels]] has been analysed by many scholars. A well-known example is the nativity narratives found in the Gospel of Matthew ({{bibleverse|Matthew|1:1-6|NASB}}) and the Gospel of Luke ({{bibleverse|Luke|3:32-34|NASB}}). Each gives a [[genealogy of Jesus]], but the names, and even the number of generations, differ between the two. &lt;!--refs should not be needed because it's wikilinked!--&gt;Apologists have suggested that the differences are the result of two different lineages, Matthew's from King David's son, Solomon, to Jacob, father of Joseph, and Luke's from King David's other son, Nathan, to [[Heli (Bible)|Heli]], father of Mary and father-in-law of Joseph.&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;Warren, Tony. [http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/faq/birth2.html "Is there a Contradiction in the Genealogies of Luke and Matthew?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114001045/http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/faq/birth2.html |date=2012-11-14 }} Created 2/2/95 / Last Modified 24 January 2000. Accessed 4 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scholar [[Geza Vermes]] points out that Luke makes no mention of Mary, and questions what purpose a maternal genealogy would serve in a Jewish setting.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', (Penguin, 2006), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] pointed out another conflict, between {{bibleverse|Matthew|12:30|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|11:23|NASB}}("[[You're either with us, or against us|He who is not with Me is against Me]]; and he who does not gather with Me scatters") and {{bibleverse|Mark|9:40|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|9:50|NASB}}("For he who is not against us [''you''] is for us [''you'']"). Bonhoeffer called these two sayings "the claim to exclusiveness and the claim to totality".  He argued that both are necessary and that "The cross of Christ makes both sayings true."&lt;ref name=Bonhoeffer&gt;[[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], "''Ethics''", p. 60–61, Touchstone; (September 1, 1995, reprint of his 1943 book) {{ISBN|0-684-81501-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.A. Carson]] commented similarly, adding he thought there are two different contexts where {{bibleverse|Mark|9:40|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|9:50|NASB}}describe the attitude listeners are to have to other possible disciples: when in doubt, be inclusive, while {{bibleverse|Matthew|12:30|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|11:23|NASB}}describe the standard listeners should apply to themselves: be in no doubt of one's own standing.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Carson, Commentary on Matthew, Expositor's Bible Commentary CDROM, [[Zondervan]], 1989–97&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentaries argue that, juxtaposed, the sayings declare the impossibility of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;See the commentaries by [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/mcgarvey/gospels.viii.xiii.html?scrBook=Mark&amp;scrCh=9-9&amp;scrV=40-40#viii.xiii-p0.1 McGarvey] on Mk 9:40, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/johnson_bw/pnt.pnt0112.html Johnson] on Mt 12:30, and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/jamieson/jfb.xi.i.xiv.html?scrBook=Matt&amp;scrCh=12-12&amp;scrV=30-30#xi.i.xiv-p55.1 Brown] on Lk 11:23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern New Testament scholarship tends to view these not as separate statements, but rather one statement that has either been preserved in two different forms, or has been altered by the Gospel writers to present a point of view that expresses the needs of the Christian community at the time.&lt;ref name=Culpepper&gt;R. Alan Culpepper, John, the Son of Zebedee: The Life of a Legend, Continuum International Publishing (2000), pp. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Mark, generally considered the earliest of the Gospels, presents the 'inclusive' formulation, in association with an account of Jesus rebuking his followers for stopping someone from carrying out [[exorcisms]] in his name. The Gospel of Matthew has the other, 'exclusive' version, preceded by a [[Parable of the strong man|story about a strong man]]; the Gospel of Mark also includes this story, but without the concluding observation. The Luke version presents both versions. There is still lively discussion about which version is the more authentic,&lt;ref name=Culpepper /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian H. Henderson, ''Jesus, Rhetoric and Law'', Brill (1996), pp. 333–334; William David Davies, Dale C. Allison, ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew'', Continuum International Publishing (2004), pp. 333–334.&lt;/ref&gt; see also the [[Jesus Seminar]].

Barton and Muddiman cite inconsistencies between the gospel writers about what happened at Christ's tomb. They note that "In Mk 16:1 there are three women at the tomb, in Mt 28:1 two, and in Lk 23:55-24:10 more than three. In Mark and Luke they come with spices to anoint Jesus, but in the Fourth Gospel this has already been done.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond E. Brown]] notes the apparent disagreements between the New Testament books in reporting the words of Jesus concerning his prediction of the destruction of the Temple. In Mark 13:2 it is reported as a direct statement: "And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down." However, in Mark 14:57-58, the event becomes words from people who "bare false witness against him"; in Mark 15:29, Jesus' words are used to blaspheme him; and in Acts 6:13-14, similar words are again said to be from those bearing false witness. Furthermore, Matthew 26:60-61 and 27:39-40 has people accusing Jesus and blaspheming him as someone who had said such words, while John 2:19-21 reports Jesus saying directly that the sanctuary would be destroyed, but actually speaking "of the sanctuary of his body". Brown suggests that the various accounts show that Jesus did not have God's detailed foreknowledge of what was to happen to the Temple. In evidence for this lack of detailed prescience, he points out that there are many stones left upon other stones in the remains of Herod's temple, for instance in the [[Wailing Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, RE., ''An Introduction to New Testament Christology'', Paulist Press, 1994, pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ehrman, a more important difference among the Gospels is with the book of John. He argues that the concept that Jesus existed before his birth, was a divine being, and became human is only claimed in the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Ehrmanr&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus, Interrupted, Harper Collins Publishing (2009), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars disagree, locating pre-existent and divine Christology within the Pauline epistles and synoptic gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Douglad McCready, ''He Came Down from Heaven: The Preexistence of Christ And the Christian Faith.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon J. Gathercole]], ''The Preexistent Son: Recovering the Christologies of Matthew, Mark and Luke.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Acts of the Apostles=====
{{Main article|Conversion of Paul}}
{{See also|Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles}}
In the "''Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties''", [[Gleason Archer|Archer]] examines two verses in Acts describing the [[Conversion of Paul]] which are sometimes perceived as a contradiction:&lt;ref name=ArcherBD&gt;Archer, Gleason L., "Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties", p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"''The men who travelled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one''" {{bibleverse|Acts|9:7|NASB}}
:"''And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me''" {{bibleverse|Acts|22:9|NASB}}
Archer claims that the original Greek shows "there is no real contradiction between these two statements" because "Greek makes a distinction between hearing a sound as a noise (in which case the object to the verb "to hear" takes the genitive case) and hearing a voice as a thought-conveying message (in which case it takes the accusative)" and "in neither account is it stated that his companions ever heard that Voice in the accusative case".&lt;ref name=ArcherBD /&gt;  Archer points to similar circumstances where "the crowd who heard the sound of the Father talking to the Son in John 12:28 ... perceived it only as thunder".&lt;ref name=ArcherBD /&gt;

{{bibleverse|Acts|17:15-16}} is another troublesome part:

:"''So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.''"

The verse appear to place Jacob's burial in [[Shechem]], contradicting verses in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] which places the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] tomb in [[Hebron]]. [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] writes "the text now stands, it is an evident error."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biblehub.com/commentaries/acts/7-15.htm|title=Acts 7:15 Commentaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gospel and Acts=====
{{See also|Judas Iscariot}}
In {{bibleverse|Matthew|27:3-8|NASB}}, Judas returns the bribe Christians believe he had immorally accepted for handing over Jesus, throwing the money into the temple before hanging himself. The temple priests, unwilling to return the defiled money to the treasury,&lt;ref&gt;"It was not lawful to take into the Temple-treasury, for the purchase of sacred things, money that had been unlawfully gained." [[Alfred Edersheim]] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edersheim/lifetimes.x.xiv.html Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, 5.xiv], 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; used it instead to buy a field known as the Potter's Field, as a plot in which to bury strangers. In {{bibleverse|Acts|1:18|NASB}}, on the other hand, Judas, having not committed suicide out of guilt, used the bribe money to buy the field himself, and his death in the field is attributed thus: "falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out."

[[Raymond E. Brown]] points to the obvious contradiction: "Luke's account of the death of Judas in Acts 1:18 is scarcely reconcilable with Matt 27:3-10."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''An Introduction to the New Testament'', p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel harmony|Harmonization]] of the two accounts has been tried since ancient times&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Alfred Edersheim]] concluded, "there is no real divergence". [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edersheim/lifetimes.x.xiv.html Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, 5.xiv], 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;  and occasionally still today.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Dr C Gempt suggests: "The details that seem at variance can be reconciled...after refusing the money the priests bought the field in Judas' name..and it was there that he hanged himself." His body was no longer hanging by the time it was discovered, but had fallen ... to the ground where it had split open.'Inter-Varsity Press New Bible Commentary 21st Century edition p1071&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholars tend to find these unconvincing,&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Talbert, ''Reading Acts: A Literary and Theological Commentary'', Smyth &amp; Helwys (2005) p. 15. {{ISBN|1-57312-277-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out, for instance, the absence of any indication of suicide in the story in Acts.&lt;ref&gt;Mikeal C. Parsons, ''Acts'' (Baker Academic, 2008) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Epistles=====
{{Main article|Antinomianism}}
The [[Tübingen school]] of historians founded by [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|F. C. Baur]] believes that in [[Early Christianity]], there was conflict between [[Pauline Christianity]] and the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem Church]] led by [[James the Just]], [[Simon Peter]], and [[John the Apostle]], the so-called "[[Jewish Christians]]" or "Pillars of the Church".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08280a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St. James the Less]: "Then we lose sight of James till St. Paul, three years after his conversion (A.D. 37), went up to Jerusalem. ... On the same occasion, the "pillars" of the Church, James, Peter, and John "gave to me (Paul) and Barnabas the [[Right hand of Christian fellowship|right hands of fellowship]]; that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision" (Galatians 2:9)."&lt;/ref&gt; Paul believed that the [[gentiles]] and Jewish Christians were no longer obligated to keep the Mosaic law ({{bibleref2|Gal|2:21}}). The Jewish Christians disagreed, believing that everyone, including the gentiles, must keep the Mosaic law. In {{bibleref2|Galatians|2:14}}, part of the "[[Incident at Antioch]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Judaizers] see section titled: "THE INCIDENT AT ANTIOCH"&lt;/ref&gt; Paul publicly rebuked Peter for [[judaize|judaizing]].

[[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] claims several times that believers are saved by [[Divine grace]], and that believers are therefore ''"not under law, but under [[Grace in Christianity|grace]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Rom|6:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Epistle of James, in contrast, claims that Christians are to obey the ''"whole law"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|James|2:10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ''"a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone"'', and that ''"faith without works is dead"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|James|2:14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants, with their belief in [[Sola Fide|salvation by faith alone]], have had difficulty reconciling these contradictory views. [[Martin Luther]], for example, asserted that the [[Epistle of James]] might be a forgery, and relegated it to an appendix in his Bible (although he later accepted its canonicity - see [[Antilegomena]]).

Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe that Paul and James do not contradict each other but speak about different questions.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Douglas J. Moo]] writes that ''"if a sinner can get into relationship with God only by faith (Paul), the ultimate validation of that relationship takes into account the works that true faith must inevitably produce (James)."''Douglas J. Moo, ''The Letter of James'', Erdmans Publishing, 2000, p. 141 - [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQJgtkaIUTIC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=the+letter+of+james+douglas+j.+moo#PPA141,M1 The Letter of James]&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that the perspective of Paul is different from, and complementary to, that of James - ''"When Paul claims that one is justified by faith alone, apart from works, he is referring to works that precede salvation. Conversely, when James insists on works as necessary to justification, he has in view works that follow and validate salvation."''&lt;ref&gt;Dr. R. Bruce Compton: [http://www.dbts.edu/journals/1997/Jas2.pdf James 2:21-24 and the justification of Abraham, p. 44] - many scholars are referred to in the footnotes!&lt;/ref&gt; Paul states in various passages that works have to follow faith ({{bibleref2|Titus|2:11-12}}, {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:10}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|6:13}}, {{bibleref2|Galatians|5:13}}, etc.).

In [[I Corinthians]]: "Inconsistencies have been found within later chapters, for instance between an apparently softer stance on sacrificial food in 8:1-13 and 10:22-11:1, and a harder line in 10:1-22."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 1108.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the letter "seems to place a total ban on women's speech in church, which is strangely inconsistent with Paul's permission in 11:2-16 that (veiled) women could pray and prophesy."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Old Testament versus New Testament=====
{{Main article|Christian views on the Old Covenant|Christianity and Judaism|New Covenant|Antinomianism|Ethics in the Bible}}
In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian [[Marcion]] composed a work (now lost) entitled ''Antithesis''. In the Antithesis, [[Marcion]] set out in detail and discussed at length the contradictions between the Old Testament and New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcionite-scripture.info/CB-The-Antithesis.pdf The Antithesis], Dr. Carroll Bierbower&lt;/ref&gt; The Old and New Testaments, Marcion argued, cannot be reconciled to each other. The code of conduct advocated by Moses was "[[an eye for an eye]]", but [[Matthew 5:39|Jesus set this precept aside]]. Marcion pointed to Isaiah 45:7 "''I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all these things''. He contrasted this with Jesus' saying that "''a tree was known by its fruit, a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit''" and then pointed to several injunctions and lessons in the Old Testament that the New Testament contradicts. For example, [[Elisha]] had children eaten by bears; Jesus said, "''Let the little children come to me''". [[Joshua]] had the sun stopped in order to prolong the slaughter of his enemies. [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] quoted Jesus as commanding "''Let not the sun go down on your wrath''"(Eph 4:26). In the Old Testament, [[divorce]] was permitted and so was [[polygamy]]; in the New Testament, neither is allowed. [[Moses]] enforced the [[Jewish Sabbath]] and [[Jewish Law]]; Jesus has [[Christian liberty|de-institutionalised]] both. Even within the Old Testament, Marcion found contradictions. For example,  God commanded that no work should be done on the Sabbath, yet he told the Israelites to carry the [[ark of the covenant|ark]] around Jericho seven times on the Sabbath. No graven image was to be made, yet Moses was directed to fashion a [[Nehushtan|bronze serpent]]. Marcion therefore rejected the entire Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZiX5d09931UC&amp;pg=PA92 The canon of the New Testament: its origin, development, and significance], [[Bruce Manning Metzger]], p. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The early church, [[W. H. C. Frend]], p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcion: The Gospel of the Alien God, [[Adolf Von Harnack]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One Christian view is that [[Jesus]] mediates a [[New Covenant]] relationship between God and his followers and [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abolished the Mosaic Laws]], according to the [[New Testament]] ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|10:15-18}}; {{bibleverse||Gal|3:23-25}}; {{bibleverse|2|Cor|3:7-17}}; {{bibleverse||Eph|2:15}}; {{bibleverse||Heb|8:13}}, {{bibleverse||Rom|7:6}} etc.) From a [[Jewish]] perspective however, the [[Torah]] was given to the Jewish people and [[B'nei Noah]] as an eternal covenant (for example {{bibleverse||Exod|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse||Exod|12:14-17}}, {{bibleverse||Mal|3:6-7}}) and will never be replaced or added to (for example {{bibleverse||Deut|4:2}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|13:1|HE}}). There are differences of opinion as to how the new covenant affects the validity of biblical law. The differences are mainly as a result of attempts to harmonize biblical statements that the biblical law is eternal ({{bibleverse||Exodus|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exod|12:14-17}}) with New Testament statements that suggest that it [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|does not now apply at all]], or at least [[Cafeteria Christianity|does not fully apply]]. Most biblical scholars admit the issue of the Law can be confusing and the topic of [[Paul the Apostle#Relationship with Judaism|Paul and the Law]] is still frequently debated among New Testament scholars&lt;ref&gt;Gundry, ed., ''Five Views on Law and Gospel''. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, see [[New Perspective on Paul]], [[Pauline Christianity]]); hence the various views.

The '''law school of Beirut''' (also known as the '''law school of Berytus''' and the '''school of Roman law at Berytus''') was a center for the study of [[Roman law]] in [[classical antiquity]] located in [[Beirut]] ({{Lang-la|Berytus}}). It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of [[jurisprudence]] until its destruction in AD 551.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial [[Constitution (Roman law)|constitutions]] and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of [[jurist]]s in referring to legal [[precedent]]s. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure, but probably it was under [[Augustus]] in the first century. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 AD, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical legal texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]] but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635 AD. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
As the guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative (''[[Ius|jus]]'') was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"&gt;Walker 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the [[jurist]]s (''iuris consulti''), who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s (''constitutiones''), and legal scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored legal scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world]], aimed specifically at training professional jurists.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"/&gt;

==History==
During the reign of Augustus, [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Named after Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charnock 1859, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; (and granted the status of ''[[Ius Italicum]]'') as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for [[Battle of Actium]] veterans from the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]] legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology |date=July–August 2011 | volume=64 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large church at the edge of an archaeological field.|St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo|Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaumaturgus 239, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned during AD 222–235;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon 1854, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesis had been supported by [[Gilles Ménage]], a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]], however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian [[Karl Hase]] advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudorff  1857, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer 1868, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Mommsen]] linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[publishing|published]] and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen 1901, pp. 139–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jidejian 1973, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of [[Latin]], which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark 2011, p. 36"&gt;Clark 2011, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174"&gt;Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed “ecumenical masters”.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy 2012, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; From 425, the law school of [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and [[Athens]] in 529&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt; because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle 2008, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of [[Sidon]], pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 54–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to [[Roman law]]; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

===Preparatory studies===
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Mosaic depicting the bust of a severe-looking man wearing a crown and an intricate royal purple tunic.|[[Justinian I]], the emperor who instigated the rewriting of Roman law]]
Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the 5th century. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika|Basilica]]'' provide glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze legal texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt; which was the long-established [[lingua franca]] of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;

The ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, ''Dupondii''; second, ''Edictales''; third, ''Papinianistae''; fourth, ''Lytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 224–240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard 1999, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.&lt;ref name="Corcoran"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Corcoran, Simon | authorlink=Simon Corcoran | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106095259/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | archivedate=November 6, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"&gt;Monro 1872, pp. xviii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', namely the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' (Institutes), ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (Digest) and ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' (Code).&lt;ref name="Corcoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 1–4 of the Digest are called the ''Prota''.&lt;/ref&gt; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5–11), the ''de rebus'' (books 12–19) and  the ''libri singularis'' (books 23, 26, 28 and 30).&lt;/ref&gt; and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous ''Dupondii'' (which means "two pennies") to ''Iustiniani novi'' and dubbed fifth-year students ''Prolytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckland 1921, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, works of legal scholarship, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

[[Antioch]]-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: τῆς οἰκουμένης διδάσκαλοι). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The seven revered masters, cited with praise by 6th-century scholars, were [[Cyrillus]], [[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]], [[Domninus (jurist)|Domninus]], [[Demosthenes (jurist)|Demosthenes]], [[Eudoxius (jurist)|Eudoxius]], [[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] and [[Amblichus]].&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"/&gt;

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt; He is believed to have taught as of {{circa|lk=no|400}} or {{circa|lk=no|410}}. Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important ''scholia'' appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the ''Basilica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cyrillus |volume=7 |page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.&lt;ref&gt;Jalabert 1906, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 132–138&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] between 503 and 504, and became [[Magister militum]] in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]], which opposed the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] to the followers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the ''Digesta''. Under the supervision of [[Tribonian]], Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the ''Institutiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest2"&gt;Monro 1872, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim 1921, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of Phoenicia Maritima.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable students===
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the [[presbyter]] of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers [[Aphian]] and [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] wrote of [[Anatolius]], a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as ''Azutrio''. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354, and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius 1596, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 to c. 395)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gaza City|Gazan]] lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received legal training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"/&gt;

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last miaphysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7"&gt;Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Another late 5th-century student was [[John Rufus]], an anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master, [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''Plerophoriae'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sterk 2009, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'', where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350,&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but the description does not specify its location. In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 63–73&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the [[souq]] between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law".&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous 5th-century law school professor.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 61–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skaf 2005, pp. 224–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and legacy==

The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson 2004, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]]. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern [[praetorian prefect]]ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-depth studies of the classical legal works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's legal reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical legal texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]], according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel 1973, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuz"&gt;Schulz 1967, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"/&gt; His 533 ''Omnem'' constitution read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 3rd century, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and [[Aphian]]. Under [[Cyrillus]], the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the legal training.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attridge  1992, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his ''Tanta'' constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534. The ''Tanta'' passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and quæstorian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...&lt;ref name="digest2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the [[Byzantine law]] and the [[Western law|Western legal tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Title page of an old book with ornate decorative motifs depicting a mermaid, a merman and various other creatures surrounding the Title text |Title page of a late 16th-century edition of the ''Digesta'', part of Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'']]
The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the ''[[Byzantine law#Ecloga|Ecloga legum]]'' in 741 by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his son and co-regent [[Constantine V]]. The ''Ecloga'' was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with [[Christian values]]. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 35"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192"&gt;Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled in the 9th century, issued the ''Prochiron'' and the ''Epanagoge'', which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restoring the Justinian laws.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 405"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91"&gt;Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prochiron'' served as the basis for the legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, [[Saint Sava]]. His legal compilation was intended for the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307"&gt;Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; Around 900, Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] commissioned the ''Basilica'', a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, pp. 35–36"&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the legal history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.&lt;ref name="Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300"&gt;Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; In 1088, [[Irnerius]], a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in [[Bologna]], was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "[[glossator]]s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.&lt;ref name="Evans 2005, p. 25"&gt;Evans 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 2"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 128"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]], the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 199"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.&lt;ref name="log"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://beirut.gov.lb/ | title = Beirut Official Website | publisher = Municipality of Beirut | accessdate = June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Guide musical''''' (English: The Music Guide) was a weekly French-language Belgian and French classical music periodical founded 1 March 1855 in Brussels by Peter Bernhard Schott (1821–1873), of the Brussels music publishing house [[Schott frères]] (Schott brothers).&lt;ref name="Sandrine" /&gt;

==Editors and history==
[[Maurice Kufferath]] (1852–1919) was editor from 1887 to 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''The Music Reviews and Criticism in Wallonia and Brussels in the Nineteenth Century'', by Henri Albert Alexander Vanhulst (born 1943) (Brussels), ''Periodica Musica'' (in French), [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]]: [[University of Maryland]] (publisher), vol. IX (1991), pp. 15–19; {{ISSN|0822-7594}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, the editorial office relocated to Paris and began publishing from both Paris and Brussels. In 1892, Otto Junne, director of [[Schott frères]], sold the periodical to Kufferath, the editor. From 1894 to 1905, Hugues Imbert (1842–1905) became editor-in-chief, then Henri de Curzon (1861–1942). Kufferath preserved the publication's Franco-Belgium character. The publication ceased publication in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Guide musical|url=http://www.ripm.org/?page=JournalInfo&amp;ABB=GMU|publisher=ripm|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mandat International''', also known as the '''International Cooperation Foundation''', is an international [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] with consultative status to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the [[UNDPI]], and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]].

==Aims==
Mandat Internatioal aims to promote international dialogue and cooperation, including in the research domain. It promotes international law, data protection and sustainable development. It is strictly independent from any political or religious affiliation.

==Activities==
Mandat International is a foundation with public utility status, relying on a network of members covering the various fields of activity of international cooperation. It collaborates closely with most of the international organizations and is independent of any political or religious affiliation. Its first aim is is to promote international cooperation, including in the research domain. Its activities encompass various domains, from ICT research, to international law and privacy, multistakeholder dialogue and international research projects. Over time, the foundation has developed many projects, including several international research projects, international conferences and events, support to over 10’000 delegates for attending international conferences, educational programes, creating the Eduki foundation, legal search engines, conferences, etc. The foundation usually supports projects for a limited period of time but with the objective to have a sustainable impact. When its objectives are achieved it usually pioneers and addresses new emerging challenges.

The current focus of the foundation is on promoting international cooperation with the research community, developing international research projects, supporting technology transfer from the ressearch community to standardization and international organizations, and promoting international law. The foundation is also actively engaged in the Internet of Things domain to promote international cooperation and dissemination, in line with the International Declaration on Internet of Things for Sustainable Development adopted by the IoT Forum and the ITU.

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

'''Orientalism''' is a term used by art historians and literary and [[cultural studies]] scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in [[Eastern world|West Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian cultures]]. These depictions are usually done by writers, designers, and artists from the West. In particular, '''Orientalist painting''', depicting more specifically "the [[Middle East]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the many specialisms of 19th-century [[academic art]], and the literature of Western countries took a similar interest in Oriental themes.

Since the publication of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term "Orientalism" to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies. In Said's analysis, the West [[Essentialism|essentializes]] these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood Mamdani, ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terrorism'', New York: Pantheon, 2004; {{ISBN|0-375-42285-4}}; p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Orientalism refers to the [[Orient]], in reference and opposition to the [[Occident]]; the East and the West, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''Oriens'', ''Oxford English Dictionary''. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The word Orient entered the English language as the [[Middle French]] ''orient''. The root word ''oriēns'', from the Latin ''Oriēns'', has synonymous denotations: The eastern part of the world; the sky whence comes the sun; the east; the rising sun, etc.; yet the denotation changed as a term of geography. In the "[[Monk's Tale]]" (1375), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] wrote: "That they conquered many regnes grete / In the orient, with many a fair citee." The term "orient" refers to countries east of the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Europe. ''In Place of Fear'' (1952), [[Aneurin Bevan]] used an expanded denotation of the Orient that comprehended [[East Asia]]: "the awakening of the Orient under the impact of Western ideas". Edward Said said that Orientalism "enables the political, economic, cultural and social domination of the West, not just during colonial times, but also in the present."&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 357&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
In art history, the term Orientalism refers to the works of the Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in [[Western Asia]], during the 19th century. In that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France, where the dismissive use of the term "Orientalist" was made popular by the art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]].&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such social disdain for a style of [[Representation (arts)|representational art]], the [[Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français|French Society of Orientalist Painters]] was founded in 1893, with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] as the honorary president;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 74&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Britain, the term Orientalist identified "an artist".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the French Orientalist Painters Society changed the consciousness of practitioners towards the end of the 19th century, since artists could now see themselves as part of a distinct art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, R., ''Orientalist Aesthetics: Art, Colonialism, and French North Africa, 1880-1930,'' 2003, pp 57 -78&lt;/ref&gt; As an art movement, Orientalist painting is generally treated as one of the many branches of 19th-century [[academic art]]; however, many different styles of Orientalist art were in evidence. Art historians tend to identify two broad types of Orientalist artist: the realists who carefully painted what they observed and those who imagined Orientalist scenes without ever leaving the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Volait, "Middle Eastern collections of Orientalist Painting at the Turn of the 21st century: Paradoxical reversal or persistent misunderstanding?; François Pouillon and Jean-Claude Vatin, ''After Orientalism: Critical perspectives on Western Agency and Eastern Reappropriations," ''Leiden Studies in Islam and Society,'' pp 251-271, 2014, Online: &lt;http://www.brill.com/products/book/after-orientalism&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; French painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863) and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) are widely regarded as the leading luminaries of the Orientalist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com, https://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-general/orientalism&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental studies===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] identified a scholar who specialized in the languages and literatures of the [[Eastern world]]. Among such scholars were British officials of the [[East India Company]], who said that the [[Arab culture]], the [[culture of India]], and the [[Islamic culture]]s should be studied as equal to the cultures of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Macfie |first = A. L.|year = 2002 |title = Orientalism |publisher = Longman| location = London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FrJAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn = 0582423864|ref = none| p = Ch One}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among such scholars is the philologist [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], whose studies of [[Indo-European languages]] established modern [[philology]]. British [[Company rule in India|imperial strategy in India]] favored Orientalism as a technique for developing good relations with the natives—until the 1820s, when the influence of "anglicists" such as [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] led to the promotion of Anglocentric education.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway (2006), pp. 1–2. "The Orientalism espoused by Warren Hastings, William Jones and the early East India Company sought to maintain British domination over the Indian subcontinent through patronage of Hindu and Muslim languages and institutions, rather than through their eclipse by English speech and aggressive European acculturation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Hebraists|Hebraism]] and [[Jewish studies]] gained popularity among British and German scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08624.html|title=Hebraists, Christian|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic field of [[Oriental studies]], which comprehended the cultures of the [[Near East]] and the [[Far East]], became the fields of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]].

===Critical studies===
In the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), the cultural critic Edward Said redefined the term Orientalism to describe a pervasive Western tradition — academic and artistic — of prejudiced outsider-interpretations of the Eastern world, which was shaped by the cultural attitudes of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 24&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis of ''Orientalism'' develops [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s theory of [[cultural hegemony]], and [[Michel Foucault]]'s theorisation of [[discourse]] (the [[knowledge]]-and-[[Power (social and political)|power]] relation) to criticise the scholarly tradition of Oriental studies. Said criticised contemporary scholars who perpetuated the tradition of outsider-interpretation of [[Arab]]o-Islamic cultures, especially [[Bernard Lewis]] and [[Fouad Ajami]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) Preface, 2003 ed. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of IslamicJerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=24–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analyses are of Orientalism in European literature, especially French literature, and do not analyse [[visual art]] and [[Orientalist painting]]. In that vein, the art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] applied Said's methods of critical analysis to art, "with uneven results".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6, 11 (quoted), 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[academy]], the book ''Orientalism'' (1978) became a foundational text of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of Islamic Jerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=25–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in relation to the cultural institution of [[citizenship]], Orientalism has rendered the concept of ''citizenship'' as a problem of [[epistemology]], because citizenship originated as a social institution of the Western world; as such, the problem of defining citizenship reconfigures the idea of ''Europe'' in time of crises.&lt;ref&gt;Mura, Andrea, (2015) "[https://www.academia.edu/21512966/Dis-orienting_Austerity_The_Indebted_Citizen_as_the_New_Soul_of_Europe Disorienting Austerity: The Indebted Citizen as the New Soul of Europe]" In Engin Isin (ed.), ''Citizenship After Orientalism: Transforming Political Theory''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Said said that Orientalism, as an "idea of representation is a theoretical one: The Orient is a stage on which the whole East is confined" in order to make the Eastern world "less fearsome to the West";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 363&lt;/ref&gt; that the developing world, primarily the West, is the cause of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=Edward|title=Orientalism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JncXpQQoZAo|date=April 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in ''Empire: A Very Short Introduction'' (2000), Stephen Howe agreed with Said that Western nations and their empires were created by the exploitation of underdeveloped countries, by the extraction of wealth and labour from one country to another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire:A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University press|pages=73–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In European architecture and design==
{{Further|Orientalism in early modern France}}
The [[Moresque]] style of [[Renaissance]] [[ornament (art)|ornament]] is a European adaptation of the Islamic [[arabesque]] that began in the late 15th century and was to be used in some types of work, such as [[bookbinding]], until almost the present day. Early architectural use of motifs lifted from the Indian subcontinent is known as [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]]. One of the earliest examples is the façade of [[Guildhall, London]] (1788–1789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by [[William Hodges]], and [[William Daniell|William]] and [[Thomas Daniell]] from about 1795. Examples of "Hindoo" architecture are [[Sezincote House]] (c. 1805) in [[Gloucestershire]], built for a [[nabob]] returned from [[Bengal]], and the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]].

''[[Turquerie]]'', which began as early as the late 15th century, continued until at least the 18th century, and included both the use of "Turkish" styles in the decorative arts, the adoption of Turkish costume at times, and interest in art depicting the [[Ottoman Empire]] itself. Venice, the traditional trading partner of the Ottomans, was the earliest centre, with France becoming more prominent in the 18th century.

''[[Chinoiserie]]'' is the catch-all term for the fashion for Chinese themes in decoration in Western Europe, beginning in the late 17th century and peaking in waves, especially [[Rococo]] Chinoiserie, ''c.'' 1740–1770. From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century, Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese ceramics with only partial success. Early hints of Chinoiserie appeared in the 17th century in nations with active East India companies: England (the [[East India Company]]), Denmark (the [[Danish East India Company]]), the Netherlands (the [[Dutch East India Company]]) and France (the [[French East India Company]]). Tin-glazed pottery made at [[Delft]] and other Dutch towns adopted genuine [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era [[blue and white porcelain]] from the early 17th century. Early ceramic wares made at [[Meissen]] and other centers of true [[porcelain]] imitated Chinese shapes for dishes, vases and [[teaware]]s (see [[Chinese export porcelain]]).

Pleasure pavilions in "Chinese taste" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German palaces, and in tile panels at [[Aranjuez]] near [[Madrid]]. [[Thomas Chippendale]]'s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, ''c.'' 1753–70. Sober ''homages'' to early Xing scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the ''tang'' evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs that suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream "chinoiserie". Chinoiserie media included imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments. Small [[pagoda]]s appeared on chimneypieces and full-sized ones in gardens. [[Kew]] has a magnificent garden pagoda designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. The [[Wilhelma]] (1846) in [[Stuttgart]] is an example of [[Moorish Revival architecture]]. [[Leighton House Museum|Leighton House]], built for the artist [[Frederic Leighton]], has a conventional facade but elaborate Arab-style interiors, including original Islamic tiles and other elements as well as Victorian Orientalizing work.

After 1860, ''[[Japonism]],'' sparked by the importing of [[ukiyo-e]], became an important influence in the western arts. In particular, many modern French artists such as [[Claude Monet]] and [[Edgar Degas]] were influenced by the Japanese style. [[Mary Cassatt]], an American artist who worked in France, used elements of combined patterns, flat planes and shifting perspective of Japanese prints in her own images.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Ives&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s ''[[The Peacock Room]]'' demonstrated how he used aspects of Japanese tradition and are some of the finest works of the genre. California architects [[Greene and Greene]] were inspired by Japanese elements in their design of the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] and other buildings.

[[Egyptian Revival architecture]] became popular in the early and mid-19th century and continued as a minor style into the early 20th century. [[Moorish Revival architecture]] began in the early 19th century in the German states and was particularly popular for building synagogues. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]] was a genre that arose in the late 19th century in the [[British Raj]].

==Orientalist art==
===Pre-19th century===
[[File:Gentile Bellini Madonna and Child Enthroned late 15th century.jpg|thumb|A "Bellini type" [[Islamic]] [[prayer rug]], seen from the top, at the feet of the [[Virgin Mary]], in [[Gentile Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child Enthroned'', late 15th century]]
Depictions of Islamic "[[Moors]]" and "Turks" (imprecisely named [[Muslim]] groups of [[southern Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]]) can be found in Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art. In Biblical scenes in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], secondary figures, especially Romans, were given exotic costumes that distantly reflected the clothes of the [[Near East]]. The [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] in [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity scenes]] were an especial focus for this. In general art with Biblical settings would not be considered as Orientalist except where contemporary or historicist Middle Eastern detail or settings is a feature of works, as with some paintings by [[Gentile Bellini]] and others, and a number of 19th century works. Renaissance [[Venice]] had a phase of particular interest in depictions of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in painting and [[old master print|prints]]. Gentile Bellini, who travelled to [[Constantinople]] and painted the Sultan, and [[Vittore Carpaccio]] were the leading painters. By then the depictions were more accurate, with men typically dressed all in white. The depiction of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] sometimes draws from Orientalist interest, but more often just reflects the prestige these expensive objects had in the period.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Étienne Liotard]] (1702–1789) visited [[Istanbul]] and painted numerous [[pastel]]s of Turkish domestic scenes; he also continued to wear Turkish attire for much of the time when he was back in Europe. The ambitious Scottish 18th-century artist [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] found a solution to the problem of using modern dress, considered unheroic and inelegant, in [[history painting]] by using Middle Eastern settings with Europeans wearing local costume, as travelers were advised to do. His huge ''James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758, now Edinburgh) elevates tourism to the heroic, with the two travelers wearing what look very like [[toga]]s. Many travelers had themselves painted in exotic Eastern dress on their return, including [[Lord Byron]], as did many who had never left Europe, including [[Madame de Pompadour]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Riding, ''Travellers and Sitters: The Orientalist Portrait'', in Tromans, 48–75&lt;/ref&gt; The growing French interest in exotic Oriental luxury and lack of liberty in the 18th century to some extent reflected a pointed analogy with France's own [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref name="McCabe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XnS6lVLapI4C&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=15 July 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's poetry was highly influential in introducing Europe to the heady cocktail of [[Romanticism]] in exotic Oriental settings which was to dominate 19th century Oriental art.

===French Orientalism===
[[File:Leon Cogniet - L Expedition D Egypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|240px|''The 1798 Egyptian Expedition Under the Command of Bonaparte'', [[Léon Cogniet]], 1835. [[Musée du Louvre]]]]
[[File:Ferdinand-Victor-Eugène Delacroix, French - The Death of Sardanapalus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1827]]
French Orientalist painting was transformed by [[Napoleon]]'s ultimately unsuccessful [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt and Syria]] in 1798–1801, which stimulated great public interest in [[Egyptology]], and was also recorded in subsequent years by Napoleon's court painters, especially [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], although the Middle Eastern campaign was not one on which he accompanied the army. Two of his most successful paintings, ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804) and ''[[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]]'' (1806) focus on the Emperor, as he was by then, but include many Egyptian figures, as does the less effective ''Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids'' (1810). [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]]'s ''La Révolte du Caire'' (1810) was another large and prominent example. A well-illustrated ''Description de l'Égypte'' was published by the French Government in twenty volumes between 1809 and 1828, concentrating on [[antiquities]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s first great success, ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) was painted before he visited Greece or the East, and followed his friend [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' in showing a recent incident in distant parts that had aroused public opinion. [[Greece]] was still fighting for independence from the Ottomans, and was effectively as exotic as the more Near Eastern parts of the empire. Delacroix followed up with ''[[Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi]]'' (1827), commemorating a siege of the previous year, and ''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', inspired by [[Lord Byron]], which although set in antiquity has been credited with beginning the mixture of sex, violence, lassitude and exoticism which runs through much French Orientalist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 294–296; Tromans, 128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, Delacroix finally visited what is now [[Algeria]], recently conquered by the French, and [[Morocco]], as part of a diplomatic mission to the [[Sultan of Morocco]]. He was greatly struck by what he saw, comparing the North African way of life to that of the Ancient Romans, and continued to paint subjects from his trip on his return to France. Like many later Orientalist painters, he was frustrated by the difficulty of sketching women, and many of his scenes featured [[Jews]] or warriors on horses. However, he was apparently able to get into the women's' quarters or [[harem]] of a house to sketch what became ''[[Women of Algiers]]''; few later harem scenes had this claim to authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|240px|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862]]
When Ingres, the director of the French ''Académie de peinture'', painted a highly colored vision of a ''[[Turkish bath]]'', he made his eroticized Orient publicly acceptable by his diffuse generalizing of the female forms (who might all have been the same model). More open sensuality was seen as acceptable in the exotic Orient.&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"&gt;Tromans, 135&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery persisted in art into the early 20th century, as evidenced in [[Henri Matisse]]'s orientalist semi-nudes from his Nice period, and his use of Oriental costumes and patterns. Ingres' pupil [[Théodore Chassériau]] (1819–1856) had already achieved success with his nude ''[[The Toilette of Esther]]'' (1841, [[Louvre]]) and equestrian portrait of ''Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort'' (1846) before he first visited the East, but in later decades the [[steamship]] made travel much easier and increasing numbers of artists traveled to the Middle East and beyond, painting a wide range of Oriental scenes.

In many of these works, they portrayed the Orient as exotic, colorful and sensual, not to say [[stereotype]]d. Such works typically concentrated on Arab, Jewish, and other Semitic cultures, as those were the ones visited by artists as France became more engaged in North Africa. French artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] painted many works depicting Islamic culture, often including lounging [[odalisque]]s. They stressed both lassitude and visual spectacle. Other scenes, especially in [[genre painting]], have been seen as either closely comparable to their equivalents set in modern-day or historical Europe, or as also reflecting an Orientalist mind-set in the Saidian sense of the term. Gérôme was the precursor, and often the master, of a number of French painters in the later part of the century whose works were often frankly salacious, frequently featuring scenes in harems, public baths and slave auctions (the last two also available with classical decor), and responsible, with others, for "the equation of Orientalism with the nude in pornographic mode";&lt;ref&gt;Tromans. 136&lt;/ref&gt; (''Gallery, below'')

===British Orientalism===
[[File:William Holman Hunt 002.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'', 1854–61]]
Though British political interest in the territories of the unravelling Ottoman Empire was as intense as in France, it was mostly more discreetly exercised. The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for naked women. The leading British [[genre painter]], [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] was 55 when he travelled to [[Istanbul]] and [[Jerusalem]] in 1840, dying off [[Gibraltar]] during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a [[Protestant]] agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: "a [[Martin Luther]] in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered", by which he meant traditional Christian [[iconography]]. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] had similar motivations,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 14 (quoted), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 289, disputing Rosenthal assertion, and insisting that "there must be some attempt to clarify ''whose'' reality we are talking about".&lt;/ref&gt; The French artist [[James Tissot]] also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.

William Holman Hunt produced a number of major paintings of Biblical subjects drawing on his Middle Eastern travels, improvising variants of contemporary Arab costume and furnishings to avoid specifically Islamic styles, and also some landscapes and genre subjects. The biblical subjects included ''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'' (1856), ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'' (1860), and ''[[The Shadow of Death]]'' (1871). ''[[The Miracle of the Holy Fire (painting)|The Miracle of the Holy Fire]]'' (1899) was intended as a picturesque satire on the local Eastern Christians, of whom, like most English visitors, Hunt took a very dim view. His ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'' (1854–61) is a rare contemporary narrative scene, as the young man feels his fiancé's face, which he is not allowed to see, through her veil, as a Westerner in the background beats his way up the street with his stick.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 16–17 and see index&lt;/ref&gt; This a rare intrusion of a clearly contemporary figure into an Orientalist scene; mostly they claim the picturesqueness of the historical painting so popular at the time, without the trouble of researching authentic costumes and settings.

When Gérôme exhibited ''For Sale; Slaves at Cairo'' at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1871, it was "widely found offensive", perhaps partly because the British liked to think they had successfully suppressed the [[slave trade]] in Egypt, also for cruelty and "representing fleshiness for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; But Rana Kabbani believes that "French Orientalist painting, as exemplified by the works of Gérôme, may appear more sensual, gaudy, gory and sexually explicit than its British counterpart, but this is a difference of style not substance ... Similar strains of fascination and repulsion convulsed their artists"&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, nudity and violence are more evident in British paintings set in the ancient world, and "the iconography of the ''[[odalisque]]'' ... the Oriental [[sex slave]] whose image is offered up to the viewer as freely as she herself supposedly was to her master – is almost entirely French in origin",&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt; though taken up with enthusiasm by Italian and other painters.

[[John Frederick Lewis]], who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in [[Cairo]], painted highly detailed works showing both realistic [[Genre painting|genre scenes]] of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with no traces of Western cultural influence yet apparent. His careful and seemingly affectionate representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including Gérôme in his later works. He "never painted a nude", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, quote 135; 134 on his wife; generally: 22–32, 80–85, 130–135, and see index&lt;/ref&gt; which, with the rare examples by the classicist painter [[Lord Leighton]], imagine "the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks".&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt;

Other artists concentrated on [[landscape painting]], often of desert scenes, including [[Richard Dadd]] and [[Edward Lear]]. [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) produced architectural and landscape views, many of [[antiquities]], and published very successful books of [[lithograph]]s from them.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 102–125, covers landscape&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Orientalist art was largely concerned with the areas of [[Central Asia]] that Russia was conquering during the century, and also in historical painting with the [[Mongol]]s who had dominated Russia for much of the Middle Ages, who were rarely shown in a good light. [[Nationalist]] historical painting in [[Central Europe]] and the [[Balkans]] dwelt on Turkish oppression, with [[battle scene]]s and maidens about to be raped.

The Saidian analysis has not prevented a strong revival of interest in, and collecting of, 19th century Orientalist works since the 1970s, the latter was in large part led by Middle Eastern buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 7, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and composers are not commonly referred to as "Orientalist" in the way that artists are, and relatively few specialized in Oriental topics or styles, or are even best known for their works including them. But many major figures, from Mozart to Flaubert, have produced significant works with Oriental subjects or treatments. [[Lord Byron]] with his four long "Turkish tales" in poetry, is one of the most important writers to make exotic fantasy Oriental settings a significant theme in the literature of [[Romanticism]]. Verdi's opera ''Aida'' (1871) is set in Egypt as portrayed through the content and the visual spectacle. "Aida" depicts a militaristic Egypt's tyranny over Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish Orientalism had a particular character, drawing on various beliefs about early historical links between Ireland and the East, few of which are now regarded as historically correct. The mythical [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] are one example of this. The Irish were also conscious of the views of other nations seeing them as comparably backward to the East, and Europe's "backyard Orient".&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Joseph. "Irish Orientalism," New York: Syracuse University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
In music, Orientalism may be applied to styles occurring in different periods, such as the ''alla Turca'', used by multiple composers including [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 129&lt;/ref&gt; The American musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] has identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: "the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and totalized other against which we construct our (not less reduced and totalized) sense of ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Taruskin concedes Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an "ambivalence" to the theme since "Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living side by side with 'orientals', identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Taruskin characterizes Orientalism in Romantic Russian music as having melodies "full of close little ornaments and melismas",&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; chromatic accompanying lines, drone bass&lt;ref name="taruskin165"&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;—characteristics which were used by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Sergei Lyapunov|Lyapunov]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]. These musical characteristics evoke "not just the East, but the seductive East that emasculates, enslaves, renders passive. In a word, it signifies the promise of the experience of ''nega'', a prime attribute of the orient as imagined by the Russians. ... In opera and song, ''nega'' often simply denotes S-E-X a la russe, desired or achieved."&lt;ref name="taruskin165" /&gt;

Orientalism is also traceable in music that is considered to have effects of [[exoticism]], including the ''[[japonisme]]'' in [[Claude Debussy]]'s piano music all the way to the [[sitar]] being used in recordings by [[the Beatles]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"/&gt;

===In literature===
The Romantic movement in literature began in 1785 and ended around 1830. The term "Romantic" references the ideas and culture that writers of the time reflected in their work. During this time, the culture and objects of the East began to have a profound effect on Europe. Extensive traveling by artists and members of the European elite brought travelogues and sensational tales back to the West creating a great interest in all things "foreign". Romantic Orientalism incorporates African and Asian geographic locations, well-known colonial and "native" personalities, folklore, and philosophies to create a literary environment of colonial exploration from a distinctly European worldview. The current trend in analysis of this movement references a belief in this literature as a mode to justify European colonial endeavors with the expansion of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romantic Orientalism: Overview|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/romantic/topic_4/welcome.htm|website=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''[[Salammbô (novel)|Salammbô]]'', [[Gustave Flaubert]] used ancient [[Carthage]] in North Africa as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to ancient [[Rome]]. He portrayed its culture as morally corrupting and suffused with dangerously alluring eroticism. This novel proved hugely influential on later portrayals of ancient [[Semitic cultures]].

===In film===
Said argues that the continuity of Orientalism into the present can be found in influential images, particularly through the [[Cinema of the United States]], as the West has now grown to include the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] feature film, such as the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' series, ''[[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]]'' films, and Disney's ''[[Aladdin (franchise)|Aladdin]]'' film series demonstrate the imagined geographies of the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The films usually portray the lead heroic characters as being from the Western world, while the villains often come from the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The representation of the Orient has continued in film, although this representation does not necessarily have any truth to it.

The overly sexualized character of [[Princess Jasmine]] in ''Aladdin'' is simply a continuation of the paintings from the 19th century, where women were represented as erotic, sexualized male fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Tea House of the August Moon]]'' (1956), as argued by Pedro Iacobelli, there are tropes of orientalism. He notes, that the film "tells us more about the Americans and the American's image of Okinawa rather than about the Okinawan people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}} &lt;/ref&gt;The film characterizes the Okinawans as "merry but backward" and "de-politicized", which ignored the real-life Okinawan political protests over forceful land acquisition by the American military at the time.

Kimiko Akita, in "Orientalism and the Binary of Fact and Fiction in Memoirs of a Geisha", argues that ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' (2005) contains orientalist tropes and deep "cultural misrepresentations". She states that ''Memoirs of a Geish]'' "reinforces the idea of Japanese culture and geisha as exotic, backward, irrational, dirty, profane, promiscuous, bizarre, and enigmatic".

===In dance===
During the Romantic Period of the 19th century, [[ballet]] developed a preoccupation with the exotic. This exoticism ranged from ballets set in Scotland to those based on ethereal creatures. By the later part of the century, ballets were capturing the presumed essence of the mysterious East. These ballets often included sexual themes and tended to be based on assumptions of people rather than on concrete facts. Orientalism is apparent in numerous ballets.

The Orient motivated several major ballets, which have survived since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. ''Le Corsaire'' premiered in 1856 at the Paris Opera, with choreography by [[Joseph Mazilier]].&lt;ref name="abt corsaire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Corsaire|url=http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/corsairefl.html|website=ABT|publisher=Ballet Theatre Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marius Petipa]] re-choreographed the ballet for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; Its complex storyline, loosely based on Lord Byron's poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place in Turkey and focuses on a love story between a pirate and a beautiful slave girl. Scenes include a bazaar where women are sold to men as slaves, and the Pasha's Palace, which features his harem of wives.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; In 1877, Marius Petipa choreographed ''La Bayadere'', the love story of an Indian temple dancer and Indian warrior. This ballet was based on Kalidasa's play ''Sakuntala''.&lt;ref name=Au&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Bayadere'' used vaguely Indian costuming, and incorporated Indian inspired hand gestures into classical ballet. In addition, it included a 'Hindu Dance,' motivated by Kathak, an Indian dance form.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, ''Sheherazade'', choreographed by Michel Fokine in 1910 to music by Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakov, is a story involving a shah's wife and her illicit relations with a Golden Slave, originally played by Vaslav Nijinsky.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; The ballet's controversial fixation on sex includes an orgy in an oriental harem. When the shah discovers the actions of his numerous wives and their lovers, he orders the deaths of those involved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; ''Sheherazade'' was loosely based on folktales of questionable authenticity.

Several lesser-known ballets of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also reveal Orientalism. For instance, in Petipa's ''Pharaoh's Daughter'' (1862), an Englishman imagines himself, in an opium-induced dream, as an Egyptian boy who wins the love of the Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Aspicia's costume consisted of 'Egyptian' décor on a tutu.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, Hippolyte Monplaisir's ''Brahma'', which premiered in 1868 in La Scala, Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jowitt|first1=Deborah|title=Time and the Dancing Image|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a story that involves romantic relations between a slave girl and Brahma, the Hindu god, when he visits earth.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; In addition, in 1909, Serge Diagilev included ''Cleopatra'' in Ballet's Russe's repertory. With its theme of sex, this revision of Fokine's ''Une Nuit d' Egypte'' combined the "exoticism and grandeur" that audiences of this time craved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

As one of the pioneers of modern dance in America, [[Ruth St Denis]] also explored Orientalism in her dancing. Her dances were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the exoticism of her dances catered to the interests of society women in America.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; She included ''Radha'' and ''The Cobras'' in her 'Indian' program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, ''The Nautch'' in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first 'Egyptian' work, ''Egypta''.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with ''Ishtar of the Seven Gates'' in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

While Orientalism in dance climaxed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is still present in modern times. For instance, major ballet companies regularly perform ''Le Corsaire'', ''La Bayadere'', and ''Sheherazade''. Furthermore, Orientalism is also found within newer versions of ballets. In versions of ''The Nutcracker'', such as the 2010 [[American Ballet Theatre]] production, the Chinese dance uses an arm position with the arms bent at a ninety-degree angle and the index fingers pointed upwards, while the Arabian dance uses two dimensional bent arm movements. Inspired by ballets of the past, stereotypical 'Oriental' movements and arm positions have developed and remain.

"Re-Orientalism differs from Orientalism in its manner of and reasons for referencing the West: while challenging the metanarratives of Orientalism, re-Orientalism sets up alternative metanarratives of its own in order to articulate eastern identities, simultaneously deconstructing and reinforcing Orientalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Lau|first2=Lisa|date=December 2014|title=India through re-Orientalist Lenses|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F1369801X.2014.984619|journal=Interventions|language=en|volume=17|issue=5|pages=706–727|doi=10.1080/1369801x.2014.984619|issn=1369-801X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Occidentalism]]" is often used to refer to negative views of the Western world found in Eastern societies and is founded on the sense of nationalism that spread in reaction to colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/2006/v17/n2/016587ar.pdf |title = Edward Said: Orientalism and Occidentalism|last = Lary|first = Diana|date = 2006|journal = Journal of the Canadian Historical Association / Revue de la Société historique du Canada|volume = 17| number = 2 |p = 3–15|doi = 10.7202/016587ar|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action of "[[othering]]" cultures occurs when groups are labeled as different due to characteristics that distinguish them from the perceived norm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = |journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Said]], the author of the book ''Orientalism'', argued that western powers and influential individuals such as social scientists and artists othered "the Orient".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The evolution of ideologies is often initially embedded in the language, and continues to ripple through the fabric of society by taking over the culture, economy and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Orientalism at Home: The Case of 'Canada's Toughest Neighbourhood'|last = Richardson|first = Chris|date = 2014|journal = Project Muse|volume = 27|pages = 75|doi = 10.3828/bjcs.2014.5|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Said's criticism of Western Orientalism is based on what he describes as articularizing trends. These ideologies are present in Asian works by Indian, Chinese, and Japanese writers and artists, in their views of Western culture and tradition.

A particularly significant development is the manner in which Orientalism has taken shape in non-Western cinema, as for instance in Hindi cinema.

Said has been accused of Occidentalizing the west in his critique Orientalism, ''i.e.'' of being guilty of falsely characterizing the West in the same way that he accuses Western scholars of falsely characterizing the East.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Jo|publisher = Sage|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-4129-0778-1|location = London|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said essentialized the west by creating a homogeneous image of the area. Currently, the west consists not only of Europe, but also the United States, which has become more influential and dominant over the years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Until 1955, a [[placebo]] treatment was considered a fraudulent substance administered to appease difficult patients.&lt;ref name=kaptchuk&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaptchuk TJ, Kelley JM, Deykin A, Wayne PM, Lasagna LC, Epstein IO, Kirsch I, Wechsler ME | title = Do "placebo responders" exist? | journal = Contemporary Clinical Trials | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 587–95 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18378192 | doi = 10.1016/j.cct.2008.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the defintion for Placeo has changed its connotation over the years, idealy it has come to mean the false effects are belived to be true by one's expectations. Although, it is a false substance used to satisfy one's ilness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=47b60c2f-3a13-45e2-82eb-fb70092f29f2@sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=89408012&amp;db=ers|title=Login - Sam Houston State University|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, the rise of the placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT), it became widely known throughout the academic community that [[placebo]] effects could in fact result in clinical changes and results.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; However, the ability to distinguish the efficacious ability of placebos over a period of time as well as those who are coined responders has proven difficult for scientists.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt;

== Double-blind ==
A [[Double-blind placebo-controlled trial|double-blind placebo]] is called so when neither the researcher nor the patients know who was given which form of treatment.  This is the most used form of the placebo methods. It differs from a single [[placebo]] in that the researchers actually know what patients are given which form of therapy.&lt;ref name="Moher-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = [[Br Med J]] | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Controlled studies ==
Although the double-blind placebo method is the most common, controlled [[placebo]] expierements require a different understanding. A placebo is given to one group of patients, while the treatment being tested is given to another group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm#hormone_therapy_facts|title=Hormone Therapy for Women: Side Effects, Cancer Risks|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the control is in the hands of people conducting the expierements. 

== Initial clinical experiments ==
In 1954, at [[Harvard Medical School]] a team led by [[Louis Lasagna]] lead the first known experiment to detect [[placebo]] responders.&lt;ref name=lasagna&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasagna L, Mosteller F, Von Felsinger JM, Beecher HK | title = A study of the placebo response | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 770–9 | date = June 1954 | pmid = 13158365 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(54)90441-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment approximately 162 postoperative patients were observed for significant pain relief from subcutaneous injections of [[placebo]] and morphine.&lt;ref name="lasagna"/&gt; Differences in response and attitude were exhibited between [[placebo]] respondents and non-placebo respondents.&lt;ref name="lasagna" /&gt; "Using Rorschach tests and qualitative interviews, respondents, compared to non-respondents, were more anxious, self-centered, viewed the hospital care as 'wonderful', had more somatic symptoms, used more cathartics, were 'talkers and were  regular church goers.".&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; Overall, this initial study on placebo responders versus non-responders outlined the initial yet undiscovered effects of the placebo within the placebo study.

In 1957, a team led by Wolf at [[Cornell University Medical School]] conducted an experiment to determine the reliability of the placebo response within the placebo study.&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf S, Doering CR, Clark ML, Hagans JA | title = Chance distribution and placebo reactor | journal = The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 837–41 | date = June 1957 | pmid = 13429202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on double blind [[placebo]] effects from omega 3 fatty acids and their persistant climb was done in 2006. This study concluded that although the results were "too premature to evaluate," they  showed there was a relationship between the efficacy of the antidepressant placebos and the intake of omega threes PUFAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Pao-Yen|last2=Su|first2=Kuan-Pin|date=2007-07-15|title=A Meta-Analytic Review of Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressant Efficacy of Omega-3 Fatty Acids|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=68|issue=07|pages=1056–1061|doi=10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even your daily diet can trigger aspired results.

[[File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] by [[Titian]] has a full provenance covering its passage through several owners and four countries since it was painted for [[Philip II of Spain]] in the 1550s.]]

'''Provenance''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''provenir'', 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'': "The fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; source, derivation"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally mostly used in relation to [[works of art]] but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[archive]]s, [[manuscript]]s, printed books and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, [[chain of custody|custody]] and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping [[Authentication|authenticate]] objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of [[document]]ation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term ''[[chain of custody]]''.

In [[archaeology]] and [[paleontology]], the derived term '''provenience''' is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210004312/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/terms.htm Selected Archeological Terms, National Park Service (Internet archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance.

==Works of art and antiques==
The provenance of works of [[fine art]], antiques and [[antiquities]] is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis. Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/what-we-do/contributing-sector/spoliation/ National Museum Directors' Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, [[art theft|stolen]] or [[looted art]]. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in [[Arnolfini Portrait#Provenance|the Arnolfini portrait]].

The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market; this is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long.

An expert [[certification]] can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. [[Jacques van Meegeren]] forged the work of his father [[Han van Meegeren]] (who in his turn had forged the work of [[Vermeer]]). Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries stating that a work was created by his father.

[[John Drewe]] was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive (but false) provenance and because of this galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/myatt-drewe.htm A 20th Century Master Scam]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkauctions.com/a-2-6-million-lesson-about-provenance/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching the provenance of paintings===
[[File:SirWilliamPetre.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[William Petre|Sir William Petre]], 1567: artist unknown. By the turn of the 17th century, this portrait was in the [[Lumley inventories|collection]] of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|John, 1st Baron Lumley]], a fact indicated by the ''cartellino'' (a ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' representation of an inscribed label) added to the painting at upper right. It is now in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist's studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a [[bibliography]] of when it has been discussed (or illustrated) in print.

Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting – style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Lisa, ''An Art Provenance Research Guide'' available at [http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 University of North Carolina Master's Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707092307/http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' the provenance of the painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a ''cartellino'' (a representation of an inscribed label) added to the front of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/cartellino |title=Cartellino |publisher=The National Gallery |location=London |work=Glossary |accessdate=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over.

Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings. 
*The [[Witt Library]] houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold. 
*The Heinz Library at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits. 
*The National Art Library at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a collection of UK sales catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/study-guide-art-auction-sales-sales-catalogues-price-guides/ V&amp;A Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660–1735.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.york.ac.uk/news.jsp The Art World in Britain 1660-1735]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories.  
*The [[Getty Research Institute]] in Los Angeles has a ''Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance'' (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html Provenance Index Databases]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Frick Art Reference Library]] in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/library/index.htm Frick Library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.rkd.nl/Databases Netherlands Institute for Art History Databases]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a [[stately home]], it may be recorded in an inventory – for example, the [[Lumley inventories|Lumley inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dynasties'', a catalogue of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, Karen Hearn, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a [[catalogue raisonné]] listing all the artist's known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of catalogues raisonnés is available at the [http://www.ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research]. Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the [[Ozias Humphry|"Rice" portrait]] of [[Jane Austen]] concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorynews.com/ Bendor Grosvenor blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
[[File:BRA stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section of the [[British Records Association]], a rescue service for archival material: the number indicates its earlier provenance]]
Provenance – also known as "custodial history" – is a core concept of [[archival science]] and [[archival processing]]. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items' subsequent [[chain of custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kerstin |editor1-last=Abukhanfusa |editor2-first=Jan |editor2-last=Sydbeck |title=The Principle of Provenance: report from the First Stockholm Conference on Archival Theory and the Principle of Provenance, 2–3 September 1993 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Swedish National Archives |year=1994 |isbn=9789188366115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of provenance (sometimes also termed the principle of ''archival integrity'' or ''[[respect des fonds]]'') stipulates that records originating from a common source (or [[fonds]]) should be kept together – where practicable, physically; but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in [[finding aid]]s. Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised.

The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898 (often referred to as the "[[Archival appraisal#History of appraisal theory|Dutch Manual]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Jennifer |year=2010 |chapter=Origins: evolving ideas about the principle of provenance |title=Currents of Archival Thinking |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=Eastwood |editor1-link=Terry Eastwood |editor2-first=Heather |editor2-last=MacNeil |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591586562 |pages=23-43 (27-28) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Seamus |year=2012 |title=Digital Preservation, Archival Science and Methodological Foundations for Digital Libraries |journal=New Review of Information Networking |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=43-68 (esp. 50-53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Provenance'' is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/provenance/ |title=Provenance, Journal of the Society of Georgia Archivists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pearson  | first = David  | title = Provenance Research in Book History: a Handbook  | publisher = British Library  | year = 1998 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-7123-4598-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearson, David |chapter=Provenance and Rare Book Cataloguing: Its Importance and Its Challenges | pages=1–9|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Books and Their Owners: Provenance Information and The European Cultural Heritage |publisher=[[Consortium of European Research Libraries]] | year=2005 |isbn=0-9541535-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her.

Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books.&lt;ref name="Curwen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Curwen, Tony  |author2=Jonsson, Gunilla  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Provenance and the Itinerary of the Book: Recording Provenance Data in On-line Catalogues | pages=31–47|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Imprints and Owners: Recording the Cultural Geography of Europe |publisher=Consortium of European Research Libraries | year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9541535-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jackson  | first = H. J.  | title = Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 2001 | page=2 | isbn=978-0-300-08816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves (for instance looking at inscriptions, [[marginalia]], [[bookplate]]s, [[book rhyme]]s, and bindings) and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

==Wines==
In transactions of old wine with the potential of [[Storage of wine|improving with age]], the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of [[wine fraud]]. A documented history of [[wine cellar]] conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-ageing&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= ageing |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history or the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification.

==Science==

===Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology===
[[Archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] researchers use ''provenience'' to refer to the exact location or '''find spot''' of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site,&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt; whereas ''provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term ''provenience'' appeared in the 1880s, about a century after ''provenance''. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a [[synonym]]ous variant spelling of ''provenance'', especially in [[American English]].

Any given antiquity may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). A summary of the distinction is that "provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary A. |last=Joyce |chapter=From Place to Place: Provenience, Provenance, and Archaeology |title=Provenance: An Alternate History of Art |editor1-first=Gail |editor1-last=Feigenbaum |editor2-first=Inge |editor2-last=Jackson Reist |date=2012 |page=48 |publisher=Getty Research Institute |series=Issues &amp; Debates |isbn=978-1606061220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact's "birthplace", while provenance is its "[[résumé]]",&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/provenience-vs-provenance-3971058 |first=K. Kris |last=Hirst |date=December 22, 2016 |title=Provenience, Provenance, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off: What is the difference in meaning between provenience and provenance? |work=ThoughtCo |publisher=Dotdash/IAC |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is imprecise (many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region but were used and finally deposited in another).

Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus:&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt;
{{blockquote|1=Archaeologists ... don't care who owned an object—they are more interested in the context of an object within the community of its (mostly original) users. ... [W]e are interested in why a Roman coin turned up in a shipwreck 400 years after it was made; while art historians don't really care, since they can generally figure out what mint a coin came from by the information stamped on its surface. "It's a Roman coin, what else do we need to know?" says an art historian; "The shipping trade in the Mediterranean region during late Roman times" says an archaeologist. ... [P]rovenance for an art historian is important to establish ownership, but provenience is interesting to an archaeologist to establish meaning.}}

In this context, the ''provenance'' can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation,&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt; as in art history contexts – not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or [[cultural anthropology]] may have an early provenance – a known history that predates modern research – then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition.

Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered ''[[in situ]]'', archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found (e.g. due to [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic layers]] being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site. Artifacts can also be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance.

In [[paleontology]] and [[paleoanthropology]], it is recognized that [[fossil]]s can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently ''in-situ'', in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different [[outcrop]]s. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the ''provenience'' and ''provenance'' distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website (primarily aimed at young students) of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] treats the terms as synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/24/glossary |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |work=PaleoPortal Collections Management |title=Glossary |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of ''provenience'' in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology.

While exacting details of a find's provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance.

===Data provenance===
{{see|Data lineage}}
[[Scientific research]] is generally held to be of good provenance when it is documented in detail sufficient to allow [[reproducibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Altintas, I.; Berkley, C.; Jaeger, E.; Jones, M.; Ludascher, B.; Mock S. (2004) "Kepler: An extensible system for design and execution of scientific workflows". ''Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management'', pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasquier|first1=Thomas|last2=Lau|first2=Matthew K.|last3=Trisovic|first3=Ana|last4=Boose|first4=Emery R.|last5=Couturier|first5=Ben|last6=Crosas|first6=Mercè|last7=Ellison|first7=Aaron M.|last8=Gibson|first8=Valerie|last9=Jones|first9=Chris R.|last10=Seltzer|first10=Margo|title=If these data could talk|journal=Scientific Data|date=5 September 2017|volume=4|pages=170114|doi=10.1038/sdata.2017.114|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017114|bibcode=2017NatSD...470114P}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific workflow system]]s assist scientists and programmers with tracking their data through all transformations, analyses, and interpretations. Data sets are reliable when the process used to create them are [[Reproducibility|reproducible]] and analyzable for defects.&lt;ref&gt;Boose, E.; Ellison, A.; Osterweil, L.; Clarke, L.; Podorozhny, R., Hadley, J.; Wise, A.; Foster, D. (2007) Ensuring reliable datasets for environmental models and forecasts. Ecological Informatics, 2(3):237–247&lt;/ref&gt; Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of data provenance. Examples of these initiatives are [[National Science Foundation]] [[Datanet]] projects, [[DataONE]] and Data Conservancy, as well as the [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]].&lt;ref name="Ma, et al."&gt;Ma, X.; Fox, P.; Tilmes, C.; Jacobs, K.; Waple, A. (2014) Capturing and presenting provenance of global change information. Nature Climate Change 4 (6), 409-413.&lt;/ref&gt; Some international academic consortia, such as the [[Research Data Alliance]], have specific group to tackle issues of provenance. In that case it is the Research Data Provenance Interest Group.&lt;ref&gt;https://rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-provenance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer science===
Within [[computer science]], [[Information science|informatics]] uses the term 'provenance'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Yu Shyang|last2=Ko|first2=Ryan K.L.|last3=Holmes|first3=Geoff|date=November 2013|title=Security and Data Accountability in Distributed Systems: A Provenance Survey|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6832103/|journal=2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications &amp; 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/hpcc.and.euc.2013.221|isbn=9780769550886}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mean the [[Data lineage|lineage of data]], as per data provenance, with research in the last decade extending the conceptual model of causality and relation to include processes that act on data and agents that are responsible for those processes. See, for example, the proceedings of the International Provenance Annotation Workshop (IPAW)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipaw.info/&lt;/ref&gt; and Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP).&lt;ref&gt;http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/tapp2015/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semantic web]] standards bodies, including the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] in 2014, have ratified a standard data model for provenance representation known as PROV&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; which draws from many of the better-known provenance representation systems that preceded it, such as the [[Proof Markup Language]] and the Open Provenance Model.&lt;ref&gt;http://openprovenance.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provence Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at "establishing inter-operability of systems" through information exchange agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau et al. (2008) The Open Provenance Model: An Overview, in J. Freire, D. Koop, and L. Moreau (Eds.): IPAW 2008, LNCS 5272, pp. 323–326, 2008. Springer. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.7394&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Data models and serialisation formats for delivering provenance information typically reuse existing metadata models where possible to enable this. Both the OPM Vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, J. (2010) "[http://purl.org/net/opmv/ns Open Provenance Model Vocabulary Specification]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; and the PROV Ontology&lt;ref&gt;Lebo et al. (eds.) "[https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ PROV-O: The PROV Ontology]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; make extensive use of metadata models such as [[Dublin Core]] and [[Semantic Web]] technologies such as the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL). Current practice is to rely on the W3C PROV data model, OPM's successor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khalidbelhajjame.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/w3c-prov-implementations/ "W3C PROV Implementations: Preliminary Analysis", Khalid Belhajjame, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several maintained and open-source provenance capture implementation at the operating system level such as CamFlow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://camflow.org/ CamFlow], a [[Linux security module]] by the University of Cambridge and Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasquier|first1=Thomas|last2=Han|first2=Xueyuan|last3=Goldstein|first3=Mark|last4=Moyer|first4=Thomas|last5=Eyers|first5=David|last6=Seltzer|first6=Margo|last7=Bacon|first7=Jean|title=Practical Whole-system Provenance Capture|journal=Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing|date=2017|pages=405–418|doi=10.1145/3127479.3129249|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3129249&amp;CFID=815806448&amp;CFTOKEN=34069737|publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Progger&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Xin|last2=Joshi|first2=Chaitanya|last3=Tan|first3=Alan Yu Shyang|last4=Ko|first4=Ryan Kok Leong|date=August 2015|title=Inferring User Actions from Provenance Logs|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7345350/|journal=2015 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/trustcom.2015.442|isbn=9781467379526}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Linux and MS Windows, and SPADE for Linux, [[Microsoft Windows|MS Windows]], and [[MacOS]].&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/ashish-gehani/spade/wiki&lt;/ref&gt; Other implementations exist for specific programming and scripting languages, such as RDataTracker&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/RDataTracker&lt;/ref&gt; for [[R (programming language)|R]], and NoWorkflow&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

===Petrology===
{{See also|Provenance (geology)}}
[[Image:QFLtriangle.jpg|thumb|A [[QFL diagram]] (Quartz, Feldspar, Lithic fragments) used to determine [[tectonic]] provenance in sandstones]]
In the [[geologic]] use of the term, provenance instead refers to the origin or source area of particles within a rock, most commonly in [[sedimentary rocks]]. It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram).

===Seed provenance===
Seed provenance refers to the specified area in which plants that produced seed are located or were derived. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the [[adaptationist program]] – a view that populations are universally locally adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S. J.; Lewontin; R. C. (1979). "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences'', 205: 581-598&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained that local seed is best [[Adaptation|adapted]] to local conditions, and that [[outbreeding depression]] will be avoided. [[Evolutionary biologists]] suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because:
# Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"&gt;Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
# Background population [[maladaptation]] can be driven by natural processes.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"/&gt;
# Human actions of [[habitat fragmentation]] drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Y, Van Buskirk J, Hoffmann AA (2006) Limits to the adaptive potential of small populations. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 433-458.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Natural selection]] is changing rapidly due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Parmesan C (2006) Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 637-669.&lt;/ref&gt; and habitat fragmentation
# Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (&lt;&amp;nbsp;500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham R, Ballou J, Eldridge M, Lacy R, Ralls K, et al. (2011) Predicting the probability of outbreeding depression. Conservation Biology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal [[genetic variation]] among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for [[climate change adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M., Fady, B., Gömöry, D., A’Hara, S., Wolter, F., Ducci, F. Koskela, J., Bozzano, M., Maaten, T. and Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] (EUFORGEN), Bioversity International, Rome, Italy|date=2015|page=xvi and 75 p|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers and law==
The term ''provenance'' is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. [[Chain of custody]] is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases.

Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its [[Software license|licensing terms]]. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood.

Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.&lt;ref name="Ma, et al." /&gt;
The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU [[General_Data_Protection_Regulation|GDPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pasquier |first1=Thomas |last2=Singh |first2=Jatinder |last3=Powles |first3=Julia |last4=Eyers |first4=David |last5=Seltzer |first5=Margo |last6=Bacon |first6=Jean |title=Data provenance to audit compliance with privacy policy in the Internet of Things |journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing |date=1 April 2018 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=333–344 |doi=10.1007/s00779-017-1067-4 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210921 |issn=1617-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.&lt;ref name="fast09"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/hasan/hasan_html/index.html The Case of the Fake Picasso: Preventing History Forgery with Secure Provenance], Hasan et al., USENIX FAST 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Chaining for securing data provenance in distributed information networks | author=Xinlei (Oscar) Wang, Kai Zeng, Kannan Govindan and Prasant Mohapatra. | booktitle=In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference for Military Communications. | year=2012 | conference=MILCOM '12 | DOI=10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as [[File system permissions#Permissions|read only]]. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally [[File deletion#Problem with accidental removal|deleting the file]].

'''R/V ''Rachel Carson''''' is a [[research vessel]] owned and operated by the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]]. The vessel is part of the [[University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System|UNOLS]] fleet. It is capable of conducting operations within the [[Salish Sea]] and coastal waters of the western United States and British Columbia. She can accommodate up to 28 persons, including the crew, for day operations, while up to 13 can be accommodated for multi-day operations.&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"/&gt;

==Service history==

===R/V ''Aora'', 2003–2016=== 
The ship was originally launched in May 2003 at the Macduff Shipyard in [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]], Scotland, as the 
R/V ''Aora'', a [[fisheries research vessel]].&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocean.washington.edu/story/RV_Rachel_Carson |title=R/V Rachel Carson |date=2018 |website=University of Washington School of Oceanography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was based at the [[University Marine Biological Station Millport]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverclydephotography.uk/2010/12/rv-aora.html |title=R/V Aora |last=Ward |first=Gerard |date=6 December 2010 |website=River Clyde Photography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the station was closed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.field-studies-council.org/centres/scotland/millport/about/history.aspx |title=Millport History |website=[[Field Studies Council]] |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===R/V ''Rachel Carson'', 2017–present=== 
In 2015 the University of Washington's School of Oceanography wanted to replace the fifty-year old {{ship|RV|Clifford A. Barnes}}, but were unable to raise the funds required to design and build a replacement. In December 2016 they found the ''Aora'' for sale on a yacht-trading website.&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |title=UW launches 1st voyage Saturday on bigger, better research ship |last=Farley |first=Glenn  |date=6 April 2018 |website=[[KING-TV]] |access-date=25 November 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407042551/https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |archive-date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irso.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irso.info/wp-content/uploads/Russell-RV-Rachel-Carson-Presentation-26-Sept-2018-IRSO-copy.pdf |title=R/V Rachel Carson |first=Doug |last=Russell |date=26 September 2018 |website=International Research Ship Operators |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an inspection in March 2017, the ship was purchased for $1.07m on 8 August 2017,&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt; with the aid of a $1m gift.&lt;ref name="new-uw-vessel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/05/10/new-uw-vessel-rv-rachel-carson-will-explore-regional-waters/ |title=New UW vessel, RV Rachel Carson, will explore regional waters |last=Hickey |first=Hannah |date=May 10, 2018 |website=UW News |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A programme of maintenance and some modifications at the MacDuff yard were completed in October, and the ''Rachel Carson'' was transported by ship from [[Rotterdam]] to [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] by early November.&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macduffshipdesign.com/news/the-rachel-carson-transported-to-the-university-of-washington/ |title=The "Rachel Carson" transported to the University of Washington |date=16 December 2017 |website=MacDuff Ship Design |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then transported to the University of Washington, arriving on 28 December.

The '''Sarajevo Music Academy''' or '''Music Academy | University of Sarajevo'''({{lang-bs|Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu}} or '''MAS''') is a [[Faculty of Music]] of [[University of Sarajevo]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unsa.ba/en/org-jedinica/music-academy&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Sarajevo Music  Academy  was founded by the Decision of the National Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 20, 1955 as the fourth such higher education institution in the former joint state, and the first established after the  [[World War II]]. This Decision was published in the official Gazette of the [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] No. 12/55, on June 8, 1955. The establishment of the Sarajevo Music  Academy preceded a number of favorable prerequisites, such as the establishment of a network of music schools, the founding of the [[Sarajevo National Theater]], Sarajevo Opera House, Symphony Orchestra RTV Sarajevo, the Institute for the study of folklore and the continuity of the [[Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra]].
At the founding of the Academy, the founders of this institution were:
*Milenko Živković, rector of the Academy of Music in Belgrade
*Dr. [[Dragotin Cvetko]], professor of the [[Academy of Music (Ljubljana)]]
*[[Natko Devčić]], professor at the [[Academy of Music, University of Zagreb]]
*Cvjetko Rihtman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/43975/|title=Rihtman, Cvjetko - Proleksis enciklopedija|website=proleksis.lzmk.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; director of the Folklore Research Institute in Sarajevo
*Miroslav Špiler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=59839|title=Špiler, Miroslav - Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of the Higher Pedagogical Academy in Sarajevo
*Strahinja Dramušić, in front of the Council for Education, Science and Culture of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a scorer
After the formation of the first pedagogical core at the Sarajevo Music Academy the first Rector was elected, prof. Cvetko Rihtman. In the first year of the Academy's work, 42 students were enrolled. Teaching at the Sarajevo Music Academy began on 19 December 1955 in seven sections:

*I   -  Department of Composition and Conducting
*II  -  Department of solo singing
*III -  Department of Piano 
*IV  -  Department of string Instruments
*V   -  Department of wind instruments
*VI  -  Department of Musicology
*VII -  Theoretical-pedagogical section

The fateful and tragic events that affected the former joint state in the nineties, made the Academy without a large number of teachers and associates, and the building was badly damaged on six occasions. One of the "holes" in the wall between the concert hall and the hallway, was inscribed and preserved the Academy's management, as a symbol of these difficult times. A large number of students left Sarajevo. Out of 45 permanently hired teachers and assistants at the Academy, only fifteen remained. The Academy has lost two-thirds of the collective. The only staff were teachers from other institutions that had been hired from time to time, and the number of students was about 50. Difficulties were  also reflected in the organization of the teaching itself and in the absence of a functional work space.
In spite of all that, the training was interrupted only once for a short time, in May 1995, due to a more intensive bombing. Teachers of the instrumental sections often held classes in their own apartments due to the unsuccessful working space, but also the safety. Regardless of the difficult circumstances of life and work, the rest of the Academy has preserved human and professional enthusiasm. Apart from the efforts to preserve the teaching process, the Academy's teachers played a major role in establishing the Orchestra of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, restarting the work of the Sarajevo Philharmonic, and the academic choir "Gaudeamus". Thanks to efforts from then dean, Osman-Faruk Sijarić&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/movies/stunned-by-war-the-arts-of-sarajevo-are-reawakening.html&lt;/ref&gt;, significant support and assistance from music academies and conservatories from Vienna, Bern, Graz, Karlsruhe, Madrid, Stockholm, was given and the Sarajevo Music Academy was registered unanonimuosly in the membership of the European Association of Music Conservatories and Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec-music.eu/members/our-members|title=Our Members|website=AEC|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[European Association of Conservatoires]]). In the war period, 15 students graduated ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]), 2 graduated ([[Master of Arts|MA]]) and one doctorate ([[PhD]]) was defended at the Academy. With huge difficulty, the Academy accomplished its basic function for almost the last decade of the 20th century.

In more than 62 years of existence and work of the Academy, there graduated over 2500 students, mastered them around 200, and about 24 doctorates were defended. About 300 teachers and associates were taking care about everything. Regardless of the great political, social and any other turbulence that strongly influenced all aspects of existence and work, the Academy had an upward developmental line. Today it is an internationally recognizable artistic and educational institution with developed departments, academic degrees, expressed artistic and scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.unsa.ba/historijat|title=Historijat - Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu|website=www.mas.unsa.ba|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis''' (English: ''The Gregorian School of Prague'') is an ''[[a cappella]]'' [[male voice choir]] from the [[Czech Republic]], founded in 1987 by '''David Eben'''. Their core repertoire consists of [[Gregorian chant]], [[Bohemia]]n [[plainchant]], and early [[polyphony]], but they also perform modern works including some composed for them.

==Description==

===Schola Gregoriana Pragensis===
The '''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis''' is an award winning choir from the Czech republic with primary focus on Gregorian chant and Bohemian plainchant.  The choir formed in 1987 under the direction of David Eben and was restricted in its repertoire to only [[liturgical]] music for the first two years.  Since the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, the choir has extended its repertoire to include a variety of sacred music, with particular focus on Gregorian chant ([[monophonic]] Latin liturgical music) and early polyphony.

The choir has won several awards, including the Choc du monde de le musique, 10 de Repertoire and [[Golden Harmony (Zlatá Harmonie)]].&lt;ref name="supraphon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supraphon.com/en/artists/?item=47 |website=[[Supraphon]] |title=Schola Gregoriana Pragensis |accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since inception they have toured a variety of countries.

Of particular importance is the choir's work in researching and performing Bohemian [[plainchant]] and early polyphony.{{citation needed|reason="Of particular importance" needs to be backed up by a reliable source|date=April 2016}}

The choir has between six and nine members with a repertoire of various sacred music.  They have toured many countries, including Japan, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland.&lt;ref name="supraphon" /&gt;

Their work in the interpretation of medieval music, with particular focus on Bohemian plainsong, is particularly significant with a focus on the symbolism of [[neumatic]] notation from the 10th and 11th centuries.{{citation needed|reason="particularly significant" needs to be backed up by a reliable source|date=April 2016}}  Performances feature the original [[Bohemian]] plainchant tradition, including the earliest examples of polyphony.  In addition they have performed music from 14th and 15th century and more modern compositions, including some written specifically for the group.

They have produced numerous recordings under the [[Supraphon]] and other labels.

The choir has participated in early music festivals, including the Festival Early Music at Utrecht in 2014.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.musica-dei-donum.org/concert_reviews/FOMU2014.html|title= Concert review from Festival Early Music Utrecht 2014|publisher= Musica Dei Donum|quote=With the concert of the Schola Gregoriana Pragensis we moved forward almost two centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14724">'''Sexual capital''' or '''erotic capital''' is the social value an [[individual capital|individual]] or [[social group|group]] accrues, as a result of their [[sexual attractiveness]]. As with other forms of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], sexual capital is convertible, and may be useful in acquiring other forms of capital, including [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]].

== Origins ==
The term erotic capital was first used by British [[sociologist]] [[Catherine Hakim]] in the early 2000s. Hakim defined it as separate from and building upon French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s concepts of economic, cultural and social capital. She says erotic capital is independent of class origin and therefore enables social mobility, and argues that this makes erotic capital socially subversive, which results in the prevailing power structures devaluing and trying to suppress it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Erotic Capital: The Power of Attraction in the Boardroom and the Bedroom|last = Hakim|first = Catherine|publisher = Basic Books|year = 2011|isbn = 0465027474|location = |pages = 16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the manosphere, the parallel term ''sexual market value'' or its abbreviation ''SMV'' is often used.&lt;ref&gt;Boysen, Benjamin. "Houellebecq's Priapism: The Failure of Sexual Liberation in Michel Houellebecq's Novels and Essays." Canadian Review of Comparative Literature/Revue Canadienne de Littérature Comparée 43.3 (2016): 477-497.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

===Economic===
One economic-related definition is based on the human truth capital theory of [[Gary Becker]], and predicts that people invest rationally in exhibiting their sex appeal when they can expect a return on their investments. This he defines as a form of health capital which is itself a form of [[individual capital]].&lt;ref name="Sexual Capital"&gt;{{cite journal

The sociological definition is based on Bourdieu's idea of fields.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach"&gt;{{cite journal

|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green defines ''sexual capital'' as accruing to an individual or group due to the quality and quantity of attributes that he or she possesses which elicit an [[erotic]] response in another, including physical appearance, [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and sociocultural styles. Some of these attributes may be immutable, such as an individual's race or [[height]], while others may be acquired through fitness training, or artificially, through [[plastic surgery]] or a [[makeover]], etc.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt; There is no single [[hegemonic]] form of erotic (sexual) capital. On the contrary, currencies of capital are quite variable, acquiring a hegemonic status in relation to the erotic preferences of highly specialized social groups that distinguish one [[sexual field]] from another. Importantly, this means that erotic capital is best conceived as a property of the field, and not an individual form of capital.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;

A second definition is developed by Hakim, treating erotic capital as the fourth personal asset. This definition is a multifaceted combination of physical and social attractiveness that goes well beyond sexual attractiveness that is the focus of the 'fields' perspective. Unlike Green's conception of sexual capital, Hakim's erotic capital is an individual capital with no necessary referent to a field.&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt;

Extensive supporting evidence for the concept of sexual capital, defined as beauty, physical attractiveness, and good looks, is provided in [[Daniel Hamermesh]]'s latest book, ''Beauty Pays'', where he reviews the research evidence on the economic benefits of being attractive in all contexts, including higher education teaching, politics, sales and marketing, and everyday social interaction. Hamermesh assumes these economic benefits must be due to unfair discrimination, a position he takes from [[Deborah Rhode]]'s new book, ''Beauty Bias'', a feminist lawyer's critique of the social benefits that accrue to attractive people, and the disadvantages experienced by unattractive people, most particularly the [[obese]].

==Importance==
Catherine Hakim argues that erotic capital matters beyond the sexual field, and beyond private relationships. Her research suggests that erotic capital is important in the fields of [[Mass media|media]], [[politics]], [[advertising]], [[sport]]s, [[the arts]], and in everyday [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]], and consists of six elements:&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt;

# [[Physical attractiveness|Beauty]]
# [[Sexual attraction|Sexual attractiveness]]
# Social attractiveness
# Vivaciousness and energy
# Presentation
# [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]]

Catherine Hakim's theory of erotic capital argues that erotic capital is an important fourth personal asset, alongside economic capital, cultural/human capital and social capital; that erotic capital is increasingly important in affluent modern societies; that women generally have more erotic capital than men, and that erotic capital has social benefits and privileges that benefit the female gender.&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Catherine |last=Hakim |title=Erotic capital |journal=[[European Sociological Review]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |year=2010 |pages=499–518 |doi=10.1093/esr/jcq014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This definition of erotic capital has been contested by some sociologists who reject the idea that erotic capital / sexual capital is something individuals possess, like a portable portfolio of resources, with no implicit link to the particular [[sexual field]] in which such characteristics are deemed desirable (For more, see Green, Adam Isaiah. 2013. "Erotic Capital and the Power of Desirability: Why 'Honey Money' is a Bad Collective Strategy for Remedying Gender Inequality". Sexualities 16:137-158).

Sexual capital may be related to both sexual and mental health, as when individuals with low sexual capital show diminished ability to talk about or negotiate condom use with a partner possessing greater erotic capital, and develop negative emotional states as a consequence of feeling unattractive.&lt;ref name = "Green"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi= 10.1177/002214650804900405 | last= Green | first= Adam Isaiah | title= Health and Sexual Status in an Urban Gay Enclave: An Application of the Stress Process Model | journal= Journal of Health and Social Behavior| publisher= American Sociological Association | volume= 49 | year= 2008 | pages=436–451 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In broader theoretical terms, sexual capital is important for social theory insofar as it is one among other types of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], including [[social capital]], [[symbolic capital]], and [[cultural capital]] which influence the status accorded individual members of the larger society. Sexual capital is convertible to other forms of capital, as when actors parlay sexual capital into financial capital or social capital (e.g. [[Marilyn Monroe]]),&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt; or when attractive employees get raises and social connections from bringing in more customers by virtue of their looks.&lt;ref name="Prospect"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race==
Several studies suggest that sexual capital is closely associated with [[Race (human classification)|race]] or racial stereotypes of sexual attractiveness.&lt;ref name="SocialOppression"&gt;{{cite journal

|title=Social Oppression and Attitudes Toward Sexual Practices
|journal=Journal of Black Studies
|volume=35|pages=715–729
|publisher=
|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies show a more complex relationship between erotic capital and race. For example, some black men are afforded high sexual status because they appeal to the fantasies of some white gay men.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;
Susan Koshy argues that Asian women have gained sexual capital in the West through glamorous accounts of western male – Asian female sexual relationships in the media and arts.&lt;ref name="Sexual Naturalization" /&gt; James Farrer argues that white men living in China have enhanced sexual capital arising out of associations of [[Whiteness studies|whiteness]] with modernity, sexual openness and mobility.&lt;ref name="Alien Sexual Capital"&gt;{{cite journal

==Class and gender==
Scholars suggest that sexual capital is closely tied to [[social class]]. Groes-Green argues that sexual capital and other forms of bodily power become important resources among disenfranchised young men in Southern Africa when their access to [[economic capital]] and jobs is diminished. Groes-Green further argues that the emergence of sexual capital is linked to [[gender]] relations, e.g. when poor young men build sexual capital by grooming their looks and improving sexual performance in order to satisfy female partners and in competition with [[middle class]] peers and older so-called '[[sugar daddy (slang term)|sugar-daddies]]'. Thus sexual capital reinforces [[masculinity]] in the face of male disempowerment, and it often develops as a response to conflict between [[hegemonic]] and subordinated masculinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groes-Green | first1 = Christian | year = 2009 | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol18num4/groes-green.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 286–304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital portfolios==
Because desirability in a sexual field may depend on more than merely sexual attractiveness, Green (2014) develops the concept, capital portfolio, to capture the particular combination of capitals that make an individual or group more desirable than others.  Capital portfolios typically involve a combination of sexual capital with economic, cultural and social capitals. As an example, to the extent that women, on average, value financial resources (i.e., economic capital) in their male partners more than sexual capital, and men value sexual capital more than economic capital in their female partners, so one may conclude that heterosexual women and men seek out distinctive capital portfolios that include a different, gendered balance of capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Adam Isaiah|title=Sexual Fields: Toward a Sociology of Collective Sexual Life|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social work developed in the 19th century, with roots in voluntary philanthropy and [[grassroots organizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/civil-war-reconstruction/charity-organization-societies-1877-1893/|title=Charity Organization Societies: 1877-1893 - Social Welfare History Project|date=February 4, 2013|work=Social Welfare History Project|access-date=December 29, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the act of responding to social needs have existed long before then, primarily from private charities, and religious organizations.

== Definition ==
Social work is a broad profession that intersects with several disciplines. Social work organizations offer the following definitions: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Social work is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are central to social work.  Underpinned by theories of social work, social sciences, humanities and indigenous knowledge, social work'' ''engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance wellbeing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ifsw.org/policies/definition-of-social-work/|title=Global Definition of Social Work {{!}} International Federation of Social Workers|website=ifsw.org|language=en-US|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Federation of Social Workers]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Social work is a profession concerned with helping individuals, families, groups and communities to enhance their individual and collective well-being. It aims to help people develop their skills and their ability to use their own resources and those of the community to resolve problems. Social work is concerned with individual and personal problems but also with broader social issues such as poverty, unemployment, and domestic violence."  -&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casw-acts.ca/en/what-social-work|title=What is Social Work? {{!}} Canadian Association of Social Workers|website=www.casw-acts.ca|language=en|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Association of Social Workers]]                                                                                                                                  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Social work practice consists of the professional application of social work values, principles, and techniques to one or more of the following ends: helping people obtain tangible services; counseling and psychotherapy with individuals, families, and groups; helping communities or groups provide or improve social and health services; and participating in legislative processes. The practice of social work requires knowledge of human development and behavior; of social and economic, and cultural institutions; and of the interaction of all these factors."-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naswdc.org/practice/default.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020531061348/http://www.naswdc.org/practice/default.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 31, 2002|title=Practice - NASW|website=www.naswdc.org|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Association of Social Workers]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Social workers work with individuals and families to help improve outcomes in their lives.

==History==
{{Main article|History of social work}}
[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the 19th century.]]
The practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,&lt;ref name="BoiseStateI"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I. Scientific Philanthropy (1860–1900) |work =The Social Work History Station |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-1.htm|accessdate = February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the [[Charity Organization Society]] in the mid-19th century, which was founded by [[Helen Bosanquet]] and [[Octavia Hill]] in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155|title=1800s|work=Family Action: About Us|accessdate=November 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718211919/http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians identify COS as the pioneering organization of the [[social theory]] that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation.&lt;ref name="Lymbery" /&gt; COS had its main focus on individual casework. The second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief – 'relief of paupers'. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organization Society. The third consisted of social action – rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby [[poverty reduction|alleviate poverty]]. This approach was developed originally by the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]].&lt;ref name="Lymbery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/9812_039472ch02.pdf|author=Lymbery|title=The History and Development of Social Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundation basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"&gt;Popple, Philip R. and Leighninger, Leslie. Social Work, Social Welfare, American Society. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional social work originated in [[History of England#Modern England, 18th–19th centuries|19th century England]], and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the [[Industrial Revolution]], in particular the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based [[poverty]] and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of [[charity (practice)|charity]] work.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011" /&gt;

Other important historical figures that shaped the growth of the social work profession are [[Jane Addams]], who founded the [[Hull House]] in Chicago and won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1931; [[Mary Richmond|Mary Ellen Richmond]], who wrote Social Diagnosis, one of the first social work books to incorporate law, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, and history; and [[William Beveridge]], who created the social welfare state, framing the debate on social work within the context of social welfare prevision.

==Transtheoretical models==
Social work is an interdisciplinary profession, meaning it draws from a number of areas, such as (but not limited to) [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[politics]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[ecology]], [[education]], [[health]], [[law]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[Counseling psychology|counseling]], including [[psychotherapy]]. Field work is a distinctive attribution to social work [[pedagogy]]. This equips the trainee in understanding the theories and models within the field of work. Professional practitioners from multicultural aspects have their roots in this social work [[Immersion journalism|immersion]] engagements from the early 19th century in the western countries. As an example, here are some of the models and theories used within social work practice:{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Profession==
[[Abraham Flexner]] in a 1915 lecture, "Is Social Work a Profession?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924014006617|title=Is social work a profession?|first=Abraham|last=Flexner|date=June 19, 2018|publisher=New York, The New York school of philanthropy|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; delivered at the National Conference on Charities and Corrections, examined the characteristics of a profession with reference to social work. It is not a 'single model', such as that of health, followed by medical professions such as nurses and doctors, but an integrated profession, and the likeness with medical profession is that social work requires a continued study for professional development to retain knowledge and skills that are [[evidence-based practice|evidence-based by practice standards]]. A social work professional's services lead toward the aim of providing beneficial services to individuals, dyads, families, groups, organizations and communities to achieve optimum psychosocial functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers: The Centre for Education &amp; Training | date=2011 | accessdate=November 8, 2016 | url=http://www.tcet.com/assets/pdf/nrc/employment/1-12-11/OCSWSSW.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its seven core functions are described by Popple and Leighninger as:
# Engagement — the social worker must first engage the client in early meetings to promote a collaborative relationship
# Assessment — data must be gathered that will guide and direct a plan of action to help the client
# Planning — negotiate and formulate an action plan
# Implementation — promote resource acquisition and enhance role performance
# Monitoring/Evaluation — on-going documentation through short-term goal attainment of extent to which client is following through
# Supportive Counseling — affirming, challenging, encouraging, informing, and exploring options
# Graduated Disengagement — seeking to replace the social worker with a naturally occurring resource&lt;ref&gt;Popple &amp; Leighninger, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Six other core values identified by the National Association of Social Workers' (NASW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606100446/http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-06-06|title=Code of Ethics (English and Spanish) – National Association of Social Workers|work=socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code of Ethics are:

# Service — help people in need and address social problems
# Social Justice — challenge social injustices
# Respect the dignity and worth of the person
# Give importance to human relationships
# Integrity — behave in a trustworthy manner
# Competence — practice within the areas of one's areas of expertise and develop and enhance professional skill

A historic and defining feature of social work is the profession's focus on individual well-being in a social context and the well-being of society.&lt;ref name="Crisp"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Crisp, B.R.|author2=Beddoe, L.|date=December 2012|title=Promoting Health and Well-being in Social Work Education|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social workers promote [[social justice]] and [[social change]] with and on behalf of clients.&lt;ref name="Stefaroi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefaroi, Petru|date=December 2014|title=Humane &amp; Spiritual Qualities of the Professional in Humanistic Social Work: Humanistic Social Work – The Third Way in Theory and Practice|location=Charleston|publisher=Createspace|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "client" can be an individual, family, group, organization, or community.&lt;ref&gt;NASW, Code of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadening scope of the modern social worker's role, some practitioners have in recent years traveled to war-torn countries to provide psychosocial assistance to families and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Kosovo Family Support Project:Offering Psychosocial Support for Families with Missing Persons |author1=Keough, Mary Ellen  |author2=Samuels, Margaret F. | journal=Social Work |date=October 2004 | volume=49 | issue=4 | pages=587–594 | doi=10.1093/sw/49.4.587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer areas of social work practice involve management science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Murali D. Nair|author2=Erick G.

S.|year=2004|title=Banking the poor: Policies to bring low-income Americans into the financial mainstream|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area that social workers are focusing is risk management, risk in social work is taken as Knight in 1921 defined "If you don't even know for sure what will happen, but you know the odds, that is risk and If you don't even know the odds, that is uncertainty." Risk management in social work means minimising the risks while increasing potential benefits for clients by analysing the risks and benefits in duty of care or in decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllida Parsole. Risk assessment in social care and social work. 2001. Jessica Kingsley Publishers.pg. 17+&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, according to the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), a branch of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], professional social workers are the largest group of mental health services providers. There are more clinically trained social workers—over 200,000—than psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses combined. Federal law and the National Institutes of Health recognize social work as one of five core mental health professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Association of Social Workers |url=http://www.socialworkers.org/ |work=NASW |accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of fields a social worker may be employed in are [[poverty relief]], [[life skills|life skills education]], [[community development]], [[rural development]], [[forensics]] and [[corrections]], [[legislation]], [[industrial relations]], [[project management]], [[child protection]], [[elder abuse|elder protection]], [[women's rights]], [[human rights]], [[systems theory|systems optimization]], [[Financial social work|finance]], [[drug rehabilitation|addictions rehabilitation]], [[child development]], [[Cross-cultural psychology|cross-cultural mediation]], [[occupational safety and health]], [[disaster management]], [[mental health]], [[psychosocial|psychosocial therapy]], [[disabilities]], etc.

==Qualifications==
[[File:Czythumbur.jpg|thumbnail|252x252px|right|Social Work training begins in a structured manner at higher educational institutions (universities and colleges), coupled with or followed by practical internships and externships.]]
The education of social workers begins with a bachelor's degree (BA, BSc, BSSW, BSW, etc.) or diploma in social work or a [[Bachelor of Social Services]]. Some countries offer postgraduate degrees in social work, such as a master's degree (MSW, MSSW, MSS, MSSA, MA, MSc, MRes, MPhil.) or doctoral studies (PhD and DSW (Doctor of Social Work)). Increasingly, graduates of social work programs pursue post-masters and post-doctoral study, including training in psychotherapy.

In the United States, social work undergraduate and master's programs are accredited by the [[Council on Social Work Education]]. A CSWE-accredited degree is required for one to become a state-licensed social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/careers/how-to-become-a-licensed-clinical-social-worker.html|title=How to Become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW)|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-dsw/|title=Online Doctorate of Social Work (DSW) Programs|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSWE even accredits online master's in social work programs in traditional and advanced standing options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-schools.html|title=Online MSW Programs: 2018's Full List of CSWE Accredited Schools|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, the New York [[Charity Organization Society]], which was the [[Columbia University School of Social Work]]'s earliest entity, began offering formal "social philanthropy" courses, marking both the beginning date for social work education in the United States, as well as the launching of professional social work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2vnns1wL8wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=history+of+columbia+university+school+of+social+work+first&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OKcgdIAK4S&amp;sig=ELBKCq_wU25ep2y0EYXYBo92vsg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigxZC1obDYAhVDRN8KHTjhC74Q6AEIXjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20columbia%20university%20school%20of%20social%20work%20first&amp;f=false|title=The Columbia University School of Social Work: A Centennial Celebration|last=Feldman|first=Ronald A.|last2=Kamerman|first2=Sheila B.|date=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231122825|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of countries and jurisdictions require [[Licensure|registration]] or [[licensure]] of people working as social workers, and there are mandated [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Association of Social Workers]] (NASW, 2005). NASW Fact Sheet. Retrieved November 15, 2006 from http://www.socialworkers.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, a professional association sets academic requirements for admission to the profession. The success of these professional bodies' efforts is demonstrated in that these same requirements are recognized by employers as necessary for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cswna.org|title=Catholic Social Workers National Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional associations===
Social workers have a number of professional associations that provide ethical guidance and other forms of support for their members and for social work in general. These associations may be international, continental, semi-continental, national, or regional. The main international associations are the [[International Federation of Social Workers]] (IFSW) and the [[International Association of Schools of Social Work]] (IASSW).

The largest professional social work association in the United States is the [[National Association of Social Workers]]. There also exist organizations that represent clinical social workers such as The American Association of Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work. AAPCSW is a national organization representing social workers who practice psychoanalytic social work and psychonalysis. There are also a number of states with Clinical Social Work Societies which represent all social workers who conduct psychotherapy from a variety of theoretical frameworks with families, groups and individuals.  The Association for Community Organization and Social Administration (ACOSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Association for Community Organization and Social Administration|url = http://www.acosa.org/joomla/|website = www.acosa.org|accessdate = October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional organization for social workers who practice within the community organizing, policy, and political spheres.

In the UK, the professional association is the [[British Association of Social Workers]] (BASW) with just over 18,000 members (as of August 2015).

The Code of Ethics of the US-based [[National Association of Social Workers]] provides a code for daily conduct and a set of principles rooted in 6 core values:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NASW Delegate Assembly|first=|date=1996|title=Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=ms_ArtLqzeI%3d&amp;portalid=0|journal=National Association of Social Workers|volume=2017 revision|pages=|via=socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siedlecki|first=Karen L.|last2=Salthouse|first2=Timothy A.|last3=Oishi|first3=Shigehiro|last4=Jeswani|first4=Sheena|date=2014-06-01|title=The Relationship Between Social Support and Subjective Well-Being Across Age |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=117|issue=2|pages=561–576|doi=10.1007/s11205-013-0361-4 |pmc=4102493|pmid=25045200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade unions representing social workers===
In the United Kingdom, just over half of social workers are employed by local authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Contemporary_History_of_Social_Work.html?id=MCyGoAEACAAJ|title=A contemporary history of social work: Learning from the past|last=Terry|first=Bamford|date=February 25, 2015|publisher=Policy Press: University of Bristol|year=2015|isbn=9781447322184|location=Bristol, United Kingdom|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of these are represented by [[UNISON]], the public sector employee union. Smaller numbers are members of the [[Unite the Union]] and the [[GMB (trade union)]]. The [[British Union of Social Work Employees]] (BUSWE) has been a section of the [[Community (trade union)]] since 2008.

While at that stage not a union, the [[British Association of Social Workers]] operated a professional advice and representation service from the early 1990s. Social Work qualified staff who are also experienced in employment law and industrial relations provide the kind of representation you would expect from a trade union in the event of grievance, discipline or conduct matters specifically in respect of professional conduct or practice. However, this service depended on the good will of employers to allow the representatives to be present at these meetings, as only trade unions have the legal right and entitlement of representation in the workplace.

By 2011 several councils had realized that they did not have to permit BASW access, and those that were challenged by skilled professional representation of their staff were withdrawing permission. For this reason BASW once again took up trade union status by forming its arms length trade union section, SWU (Social Workers Union). This gives legal right to represent its members whether the employer or [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) recognizes SWU or not.  At 2015 the TUC was still resisting SWU application for admission to congress membership and while most employers are not making formal statements of recognition until such a time as the TUC may change its policy, they are all legally required to permit SWU (BASW) representation at internal discipline hearings etc.

==Social workers in literature==
In 2011, a critic stated that "novels about social work are rare,"&lt;ref name="bounds"&gt;{{cite web

'''Sustainability measurement''' is the quantitative basis for the informed management of [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411231334/http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are still evolving: they include [[Ecological indicator|indicator]]s, benchmarks, audits, indexes and accounting,  as well as assessment, appraisal&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton, Barry and Sadler, Barry 2009. ''Sustainability Appraisal. A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience.'' London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-357-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and other reporting systems. They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T. et al. 2007. ''Sustainability Indicators'', SCOPE 67. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Simon  and Morse, Stephen 2008. ''Sustainability Indicators. Measuring the Immeasurable?'' 2nd edn. London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-299-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate [[sustainability reporting]], [[Triple bottom line|Triple Bottom Line accounting]], and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the [[Environmental Sustainability Index]] and [[Environmental Performance Index]]. An alternative approach, used by the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme and explicitly critical of the triple-bottom-line approach is [[Circles of Sustainability]].

==Sustainability indicators and their function==
The principal objective of sustainability indicators is to inform public policy-making as part of the process of [[sustainability governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Boulanger, P. M. (2008) "Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue". '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sustainability indicators can provide information on any aspect of the interplay between the environment and socio-economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Building strategic indicator sets generally deals with just a few simple questions: what is happening? (descriptive indicators), does it matter and are we reaching targets? (performance indicators), are we improving? (efficiency indicators), are measures working? (policy effectiveness indicators), and are we generally better off? (total welfare indicators). One popular general framework used by The [[European Environment Agency]] uses a slight modification of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] [[DPSIR]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Stanners, D. et al. 2007. ''Frameworks for environmental assessment and indicators at the EEA.'' In: Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; This breaks up environmental impact into five stages. Social and economic developments (consumption and production) ''(D)rive'' or initiate environmental ''(P)ressures'' which, in turn, produces a change in the ''(S)tate'' of the environment which leads to ''(I)mpacts'' of various kinds. Societal ''(R)esponses'' (policy guided by sustainability indicators) can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of events.

==Metrics at the global scale==

===United Nations Indicators===
The United Nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement  tools in relation to sustainable development &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/isd.htm] United Nations sustainable development indicators&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seea.asp], [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] UN System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benchmarks, indicators, indexes, auditing etc.===
In the last couple of decades there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability — including measures of resource use like [[life cycle assessment]], measures of consumption like the [[ecological footprint]] and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the [[Environmental Performance Index]]. The following is a list of quantitative "tools" used by sustainability scientists - the different categories are for convenience only as defining criteria will intergrade. It would be too difficult to list all those methods available at different levels of organisation so those listed here are at for the global level only.

===Resource metrics===
Part of this process can relate to resource use such as [[energy accounting]] or to economic metrics or [[price system]] values as compared to [[non-market economics]] potential, for understanding resource use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Net_energy_analysis |title=Net energy analysis |publisher=Eoearth.org |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important task for resource theory ([[energy economics]]) is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision Making, Science, and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are described and analyzed by means of the methods of mathematics and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - A Useful Concept.Intro |publisher=Exergy.se |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human factors, however, have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the [[Industrial Revolution]], and in particular have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality. A balanced view of these issues requires an understanding of the physical framework in which all human ideas, institutions, and aspirations must operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_and_economic_myths_(historical) |title=Energy and economic myths (historical) |publisher=Eoearth.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economics, oil and energy====
[[Image:Oil imports.PNG|thumb|300px|Oil imports by country]]

===Energy return on energy investment===
When oil production first began in the mid-nineteenth century, the largest oil fields recovered fifty barrels of oil for every barrel used in the extraction, transportation and refining. This ratio is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or [[EROEI]]).  Currently, between one and five barrels of oil are recovered for each barrel-equivalent of energy used in the recovery process.  As the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the [[Net energy gain]] falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source.  This happens long before the resource is physically exhausted.

Note that it is important to understand the distinction between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a [[barrel of oil equivalent]] (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source.  Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using [[natural gas]] to fuel [[enhanced oil recovery]]. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most [[Athabasca Tar Sands]] plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to [[Ethanol fuel]] produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.

====Growth-based economic models====

Insofar as [[economic growth]] is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt. [[M. King Hubbert]] believed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976/ |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our principal constraints are cultural.  During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture, a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of nongrowth.}}

Some economists describe the problem as [[uneconomic growth]] or a [[false economy]]. At the political right, [[Fred Ikle]] has warned about "conservatives addicted to the Utopia of Perpetual Growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page68.htm |title=Our Perpetual Growth Utopia |publisher=Dieoff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed - but did not stop - the growth of world [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2006/pdf/050206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed [[agriculture]] around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by [[fossil fuels]] in the form of [[fertilizers]] (natural gas), [[pesticides]] (oil), and [[hydrocarbon]] fueled [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html How peak oil could lead to starvation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818060558/http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and [[Mario Giampietro]], senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their study ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'' the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy [[world population]] will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Taggart |first=Adam |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |title=Eating Fossil Fuels |publisher=EnergyBulletin.net |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071544/http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The [[Peak oil|peaking of global oil]] along with the decline in regional [[natural gas]] production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. [[Dale Allen Pfeiffer]] claims that coming decades could see spiraling [[food]] prices without relief and massive [[starvation]] on a global level such as never experienced before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil Peak Oil: the threat to our food security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714220834/http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil |date=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oil Drum: Europe |url=http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/2225 |title=Agriculture Meets Peak Oil |publisher=Europe.theoildrum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hubbert peaks==
Although [[Hubbert peak theory]] receives most attention in relation to [[peak oil|peak oil production]], it has also been applied to other natural resources.

===Natural gas===
{{Main|Peak gas}}
Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=White |url=http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |title=State's consultant says nation is primed for using Alaska gas |date=December 17, 2005 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221153321/http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bentley (p.&amp;nbsp;189) predicted a world "decline in conventional gas production from about 2020".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Viewpoint - Global oil &amp; gas depletion: an overview

===Coal===
{{Main|Peak coal}}
Peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, but we can observe the example of [[Anthracite coal|anthracite]] in the USA, a high grade coal whose production peaked in the 1920s.  Anthracite was studied by Hubbert, and matches a curve closely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html GEO 3005: Earth Resources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725085800/http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pennsylvania's coal production also matches Hubbert's curve closely, but this does not mean that coal in Pennsylvania is exhausted—far from it.  If production in Pennsylvania returned at its all-time high, there are reserves for 190 years.  Hubbert had recoverable [[Coal#World coal reserves|coal reserves worldwide]] at 2500 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; metric tons and peaking around 2150(depending on usage).

More recent estimates suggest an earlier peak. ''Coal: Resources and Future Production'' (PDF 630KB &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |title=Startseite |publisher=Energy Watch Group |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911224731/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Rosie |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |title=Peak coal: sooner than you think |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522155229/http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |archivedate=2008-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reporting on this Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal will likely come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons  per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardheinberg.com/museletter/179 |title=Museletter |publisher=Richard Heinberg |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second study,
''The Future of Coal'' by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that
""coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future".&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml" /&gt;

Work by [[David Rutledge (engineer)|David Rutledge]] of [[Caltech]] predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 [[gigatonne]]s.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;"Coal: Bleak outlook for the black stuff", by David Strahan, [[New Scientist]], [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19726391.800-coal-bleak-outlook-for-the-black-stuff.html Jan. 19, 2008, pp. 38-41].
&lt;/ref&gt; This
implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed.

Finally, insofar as global [[peak oil]] and peak in natural gas are expected anywhere from imminently to within decades at most, any increase in coal production (mining) per annum to compensate for declines in oil or NG production, would necessarily translate to an earlier date of peak as compared with peak coal under a scenario in which annual production remains constant.

===Fissionable materials===
{{Main|Peak uranium}}
In a paper in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  after a review of US fissionable reserves, Hubbert notes of nuclear power:

{{cquote|There is promise, however, provided mankind can solve its international problems and not destroy itself with nuclear weapons, and provided world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the "foreseeable future."}}

Technologies such as the [[thorium fuel cycle]], [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] and [[Fast breeder reactor|fast breeders]] can, in theory, considerably extend the life of [[uranium]] reserves. [[Roscoe Bartlett]] claims &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025195932/http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our current throwaway nuclear cycle uses up the world reserve of low-cost uranium in about 20 years.}}

Caltech physics professor [[David Goodstein]] has stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Tony|title=Professor Goodstein discusses lowering oil reserves|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2013|date=23 November 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509063107/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|archive-date=2013-05-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that

{{cquote|... you would have to build 10,000 of the largest power plants that are feasible by engineering standards in order to replace the 10 terawatts of fossil fuel we're burning today ... that's a staggering amount and if you did that, the known reserves of uranium would last for 10 to 20 years at that burn rate. So, it's at best a bridging technology ... You can use the rest of the uranium to breed plutonium 239 then we'd have at least 100 times as much fuel to use. But that means you're making plutonium, which is an extremely dangerous thing to do in the dangerous world that we live in.}}

===Metals===
{{Main|Peak copper}}
Hubbert applied his theory to "rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976 |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as [[copper]], [[tin]], [[lead]], [[zinc]] and others would occur in the time frame of decades and [[iron]] in the time frame of two centuries like coal. The price of copper rose 500% between 2003 and 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf Copper Statistics and Information, 2007].

===Peak water===
{{Main|Peak water}}
Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources.  However [[over-exploitation]] often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless.  A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/cleanrgy/water_resource.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive.  The term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged.

===Renewable resources===

== Sustainable communities ==
Scotland's first dedicated programme for sustainable communities was delivered by Forward Scotland between 1997-1999 as part of a UK wide initiative led by Encams. Partnerships with a number of local authorities were developed and dedicated officers recruited to work with communities. This programme piloted the Community Eco-cal a forerunner of ecological footprinting. This programme was evaluated by Professor Michael Carley, Heriot-Watt University and the lessons learned informed a successor programme, 2000-2002, where community groups themselves were the focus. This produced the very first handbook for sustainable communities and a series of highly successful community projects. During this time the first community grants programme for sustainable communities was launched funded by the New Opportunities Fund (now the Big Lottery Fund). This programme funded some pioneering projects in areas such as community renewables, local food, community waste management and the first ecological footprinting projects in Scotland.

[[Community Energy Scotland]] is a charity that provides free advice, grant funding and finance for [[renewable energy]] projects developed by community groups in Scotland. The main aim of the company is to enable all communities to generate and use renewable energy for their long term and collective benefit.&lt;ref name=HICEC&gt;HICEC. (2006) ''Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company Annual Review''. Inverness. [http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/HICEC-Annual_review.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 the local [[development trust]] on the island of [[Tiree]] commissioned a 950&amp;nbsp;kW community-owned wind turbine project, the fourth such large-scale project in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tireerenewableenergy.co.uk/ "Tiree renewable energy"]. tireerenewableenergy.co.uk.

In August 2010 the historian [[James Hunter (historian)|James Hunter]] stated that the transfer of ownership into community control had brought about "a spectacular reversal of [[Gigha|Gigha's]] slide towards complete population collapse" and suggested that the UK Government should  learn lessons from this and other community buy-outs in places such as [[Assynt]], [[Eigg]], and [[Knoydart]] to inform their [[Big Society]] plans.&lt;ref&gt;"Ross, David (20 August 2010) "Cameron should visit Gigha to see the Big Society in action, says historian". Glasgow: ''The Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; These successes notwithstanding, civil servants have been criticised for impeding community buy-outs of land via the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]]. For example, the proposed community purchase of the former [[RAF Machrihanish]] base was thwarted due to technical problems with the application despite 97.4% local support in a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, David (1 September 2010).

==Public sector==

===Government policy===
The first serious policy was written in 1998 in anticipation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, by the Secretary of State's Advisory Group for Sustainable Development. This was followed by strategy that focussed on Waste, Energy and Travel in 2002 and Choosing our Future in 2005, which was written in association with the UK shared framework for sustainable development. In 2007 the Scottish National Party took office in a minority government pursuing 5 strategic objectives that encompass sustainable development but do not specifically reference it. Instead the government has adopted sustainable economic growth as its principal target.

In June 2007 [[John Swinney]], the new Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth in the [[Scottish Government]], announced plans for a Climate Change Bill that would include an intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Kevin (22 June 2007). [http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/news/display.var.1490712.0.0.php "Scotland could be ‘world leader’ in fighting climate change".] Glasgow. ''The Herald''.

The passage of the [[Climate change in Scotland#Mitigation|Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009]] has a created and informed a wide variety of initiatives. The Climate Change Delivery Plan sets out what needs to be done to achieve emissions reductions to meet the statutory targets that are included in the Act. The Climate Change Adaptation Framework, published in December 2009  aims to build resilience and capacity for change. Other public sector initiatives  include:
* The Renewable Energy Framework, the Renewables Action Plan, and the Renewable Heat Action Plan
* The [[Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009]]
* Scotland's Climate Change Declaration
* The Rural Land Use Study
* The Scottish Climate Change Impact Partnership

===Scottish Sustainable Development Forum===
The Scottish Sustainable Development Forum (SSDF) is a group the focussed on promoting debate and action on sustainable development issues in Scotland. Forum membership is open to any individual who wishes to make Scotland more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssdforum.org.uk/ "About Us"] Scottish Sustainable Development Forum. Retrieved 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies===
In January 2010 it emerged that [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]], the government body responsible for protecting the environment had failed to reach its carbon emissions targets. Its aim is to cut CO2 emissions from business activities by 25% by 2012 compared with 2006 but a report showed that they had risen by 10% in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;Fyall, Jenny (29 January 2010) '' 'Green police' fail to hit own targets".''The Scotsman''.

==Energy production and distribution==
{{Main|Renewable energy in Scotland}}
[[File:Windmills and Ailsa Craig aka Paddy's Milestone rotated.jpg|thumb|right|Wind, wave and tide make up more than 80% of Scotland's renewable energy potential.]]
The natural resource base for [[renewable energy|renewables]] is extraordinary by [[Renewable energy in the European Union|European]], and even global standards. In addition to an existing installed capacity{{Ref label|A|a|none}} of 1.3 [[watt|Gigawatts]] (GW) of [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] schemes, Scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 GW of [[wind power|wind]] and 7.5 GW of [[tidal power]], 25% of the estimated total capacity for the [[European Union]] and up to 14 GW of [[wave power]] potential, 10% of EU capacity.&lt;ref name=Pow&gt;RSPB Scotland, WWF Scotland and FOE Scotland (February 2006) ''The Power of Scotland: Cutting Carbon with Scotland's Renewable Energy''. RSPB et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SER/&gt; The renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60 GW or more, considerably greater than the existing capacity from all Scottish fuel sources of 10.3 GW.&lt;ref name=Pow/&gt;&lt;ref name=SRF4&gt;Scottish Renewables (January 2006) ''Market and Planning Report''. Issue No 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this potential remains untapped, but continuing improvements in engineering are enabling more of the [[renewable resource]]s to be utilised. Fears regarding "[[peak oil]]" and [[climate change]] have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various [[biofuel]]s. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on [[subsidy|subsidies]], it is probable that there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.&lt;ref name=Monbiot&gt;Monbiot, George (2006) ''Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning''. London. Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to planned increases in both large-scale generating capacity and microsystems using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] are being researched.&lt;ref name=BPPH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterheadhydrogenpower.com/|title=Peterhead hydrogen project|publisher=[[BP]]|accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is significant support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns about the effect of the technologies on the natural environment have been expressed. There is also an emerging political debate about the relationship between the siting, and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.&lt;ref&gt;HICEC.

===Wind power===
{{Main|Wind power in Scotland}}
Wind power in Scotland is an area of considerable activity, with 1550 MW of installed capacity as at October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/south_of_scotland/7695508.stm Turbines achieve energy landmark]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] is the fastest growing of the renewable energy technologies in Scotland and the world's largest [[wind turbine]] generator (5 MW) is currently undergoing testing in the North Sea, 15 miles off the east coast. There are numerous large wind farms as well as a number, both planned and operating, which are in community ownership. The siting of turbines is sometimes an issue, but surveys have shown high levels of community acceptance for wind power in Scotland. There is further potential for expansion, especially offshore, given the high average wind speeds.

In May 2008 Scottish and Southern Energy confirmed it was proceeding with the Greater Gabbard wind farm, located off the south coast of England. However, they sold their stake in this project, expected to become the largest wind farm in the world, to [[npower (UK)|Npower]] some six months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=52579 "Greater Gabbard Wind Project Gets Go-ahead "] (27 May 2008) Renewable Energy World.com. Retrieved 9 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, Hamish (4 November 2008) "SSE sells half of giant wind farm project to Npower for £308m." Edinburgh. ''The Scotsman''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower carbon power stations===
In May 2007 Scottish Power announced that Alstom Power and Doosan Babcock had been commissioned to design plans for "clean coal" technology at [[Longannet]] and [[Cockenzie power station|Cockenzie]] power stations. This would have become the largest project of its kind in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Alistair (18 May 2007). [http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=771022007 " 'Dinosaur' power stations in line for £1bn green revamp"]. Edinburgh. ''The Scotsman''. Retrieved on 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was cancelled in 2011 after the Westminster Government withdrew funding.&lt;ref&gt;Currie, Brian (19 Oct 2011) "Scots £1bn climate change plant is axed". Glasgow. ''The Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish Power]] have also announced that they wished to reduce carbon emissions by using biomass products such as willow or cereals at Longannet and Cockenzie. This could save up to 300,000 tonnes (330,000&amp;nbsp;tons) of carbon emissions per annum. However, the challenge of replacing large-scale power production with renewables was highlighted by the fact that to replace 5% of the fuel from these plants, fully 12% of Scotland's agricultural land would be required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6905893.stm "Crop energy power plan unveiled".] BBC online (July 19, 2007). Retrieved on 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon sequestration===
The [[British Geological Survey]] estimate that potentially 755 billion tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be stored in [[carbon dioxide sink]]s in the [[North Sea]] (Scotland's annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; output is circa 50 million tonnes). The process also aids the recovery of oil and gas as it increases pressure in the oil field. The [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] estimate that as much as 2 billion additional barrels of oil could be recovered as a result of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection.&lt;ref name=SER&gt;''A Scottish Energy Review''. (November 2005) Scottish National Party Framework Paper. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this process could reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from conventional power plants by as much as 80–90%, if combined with increased oil recovery the net savings in carbon emissions may be much less as the total volume of oil and gas used from that field would increase.&lt;ref name=Monbiot /&gt;

===Electricity distribution===
However, controversy has arisen about [[Ofgem]]'s proposed plans to increase transmission charges for distant electrical generation. This was widely seen as placing renewable energy production in Scotland at a considerable disadvantage. Jason Ormiston, the chief executive of [[Scottish Renewables]] was quoted as saying "At a time when the UK government's chief scientific adviser has said that climate change is the greatest threat to humanity, here we have the industry regulator penalising renewable electricity generators for generating where the resource is greatest."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Ian (27 July 2007).

Retrieved on 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was highlighted the following month when leaked Department of Trade and Industry documents indicated that, despite Scottish successes, under current policies Britain would miss the EU's 2020 target of 20% energy from renewables by a considerable margin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/13/renewableenergy.energy "Revealed: cover-up plan on energy target".] London.

===Hydrogen economy===
An innovative approach was proposed by [[BP]] in partnership with [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] for the creation of a hydrogen-based power station at [[Peterhead]]. The project would have taken natural gas extracted from the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]], [[cracking (chemistry)|crack]] the gas to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and burn the hydrogen as the fuel source to create electricity in a 475 MW power station. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would then have been returned to the Miller field reservoir more than {{convert|4|km|mi|0}} under the seabed in a process called carbon sequestration (see above). The scheme was expected to be in production by 2009 at a projected cost of $600&amp;nbsp;million, although it fell through as it failed to gain sufficient support from the UK government to enable this to occur. Had it been completed, the plant would have been the first industrial-scale, hydrogen power station in the world.&lt;ref name=BPPH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are ongoing attempts to keep the project alive—see for example Perry, David (25 May 2007) "Last-ditch fight on to save green gas project". Aberdeen. ''Press and Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007 a joint venture was announced by the PURE Energy Centre and the Hjaltland Housing Association to create two “unplugged” hydrogen houses on a remote site in Eshaness, [[Northmavine]], in [[Shetland]]. The installation will involve two combined heat and power systems, wind turbines and a hydrogen fuel cell to heat the houses at times when the wind is not blowing. There is also the possibility of a hydrogen refuelling station 
at the site for hydrogen-powered cars. A spokesman for PURE said “Forty per cent of the world-wide population lives with no access to 
electricity and heat. The CHP scheme will provide these populations with such access. There will be no impact on the environment whatsoever. This is totally clean energy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/HICEC-News-Oct07.pdf "‘Unplugged Houses’ at Northmavine"] (pdf) (October 2007) ''Community Energy News No 6''. Dingwall. HICEC.

In 2013 [[Baron Wallace of Tankerness]] sided with liquidators [[KPMG]] who are arguing UK insolvency law has precedence over  Scottish environmental regulations. Wallace's position, taken "on behalf of the UK Government" is that the liquidators have the power to abandon environmental clean-up costs after the company with the responsibility for them has gone bust. KPMG estimates the liquidation of Scottish Coal will leave up to £30m that would be paid to creditor [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds Bank]] rather go towards the restoration of disused mines in [[Ayrshire]] and [[Lanarkshire]]. Opponents of KPMG include the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]], [[South Lanarkshire Council]] and [[East Ayrshire Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Vass, Stephen (11 August 2013) "Scots rules attacked by UK Government in clean-up battle over open-cast mines".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8513">[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|[[Everett Rogers|Rogers]]{{'}} [[normal distribution|bell curve]]]]
The '''technology adoption lifecycle''' is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical [[normal distribution]] or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "[[innovators]]", followed by "[[early adopters]]". Next come the '''early majority''' and '''late majority''', and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "Laggards" or "phobics." For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.

The [[demographic]] and [[psychological]] (or "[[psychographic]]") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957.&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
The report summarized the categories as:&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
* [[innovators]] – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented
* [[early adopter]]s – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous
* early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours
* late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active
* laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated

The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century.

==Adaptations of the model==
The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest.

In his book ''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'', [[Geoffrey Moore]] proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets.

Disruption as it is used today are of the [[Clayton M. Christensen]] variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. 

In [[educational technology]], Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm Pencil metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128192012/http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing the [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] uptake in education. In [[medical sociology]], Carl May has proposed [[normalization process theory]] that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation.

Wenger, White and Smith, in their book ''Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities'', talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;

Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.&lt;ref&gt; Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July-September 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One way to model product adoption&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis. (2008) [http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture04.pdf Science of the Web] lectures at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; if they adopt product B, they get ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of&amp;nbsp;0.

A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks.

==History==
The technology adoption lifecycle is a [[sociological]] model that is an extension of an earlier model called ''the diffusion process'', which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and [[Everett M. Rogers]] at [[Iowa State University]] and which was originally published only for its application to [[agriculture]] and [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957&gt;{{cite journal

building on earlier research conducted there by Neal C. Gross and Bryce Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Neal C. (1942) ''The diffusion of a culture trait in two Iowa townships''. M.S. Thesis, Iowa State College, Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1943) “The diffusion of hybrid seed corn in two Iowa communities.” ''Rural Sociology'' 8: 15–24. RS(E)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1950) ''Acceptance and diffusion of hybrid corn seed in two Iowa communities''. Research Bulletin 372, Agricultural Experiment Station, Ames, Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt; Their original purpose was to track the purchase patterns of hybrid seed corn by farmers.

Beal, Rogers and Bohlen together developed a model called ''the diffusion process''&lt;ref&gt;Beal, George M., Everett M. Rogers, and Joe M. Bohlen (1957) "Validity of the concept of stages in the adoption process." ''Rural Sociology'' 22(2):166–168.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, Everett Rogers generalized the use of it in his widely acclaimed book 1962 ''[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of Innovations]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovations'', Glencoe: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (now in its fifth edition{{cn|date=November 2016}}), describing how new ideas and technologies spread in different cultures. Others have since used the model to describe how innovations spread between states in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Robert L. (1985).

'''The Spoils of War (symposium)'''
[[File:Looted_Art_-_German_loot_stored_at_Schlosskirche_Ellingen_-_Ellingen_(Bavaria_-_Germany).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|German repository of looted possessions in a church at Ellingen, Bavaria, May 1945.]]
"The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property" was a ground-breaking international [[symposium]] held in New York City in 1995 to discuss the artworks, cultural property, and historic sites damaged, lost, and [[Nazi plunder|plundered as a result of World War II]]. The three-day event was sponsored by the [[Bard Graduate Center]] for Studies in the Decorative Arts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;January 19–21, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organized by [[Elizabeth Simpson (archaeologist)|Elizabeth Simpson]], an archaeologist and professor at the Bard Graduate Center.

Worldwide interest in the subject was generated by announcements in 1991 of the location of objects confiscated by Soviet Trophy Brigades from German territory at the end of the war. The unification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were followed by a number of goodwill agreements between Germany and the countries of the former USSR, as well as the opening of official negotiations on repatriation. It was this spirit of openness and cooperation that made the New York symposium possible. This initial gathering of concerned parties would be followed by a series of conferences, initiatives, agreements, and repatriations that continue into the present.

==New York conference and proceedings==
[[File:Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect looted art HD-SN-99-02758.JPEG|thumb|Generals Bradley, Patton, and Eisenhower examining works of art stored by the Nazis in the Merkers mine, Germany, April 1945.]]The program featured 48 notable speakers—government officials, diplomats, journalists, art historians, archaeologists, lawyers, and independent researchers—from Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Australia, England, and the United States. The combined testimony laid bare another horrifying dimension to the anguish of human suffering wrought by the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The symposium was the first to address the issue in a public forum, and led to numerous initiatives on provenance research by the governments involved as well as museums, libraries, and art dealers internationally. As a result, the art world was changed irrevocably. Acquisitions policies were revised and organizations restructured to facilitate the identification of artistic and cultural objects that had been stolen or transferred illegally during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aamd.org/standards-and-practices |title=Standards &amp; Practices &amp;#124; Association of Art Museum Directors |website=Aamd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes were established to allow families to claim their missing property; such claims have resulted in many works being restored to the heirs and descendants of the rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/home |title=Welcome to |publisher=Lootedart.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Spoils of War cover.jpg|thumb|left|''The Spoils of War'' (1997), showing paintings stolen from the Russian palaces at Petrodvorets and Pushkin, abandoned in March 1945 in East Prussia by German soldiers fleeing the Red Army.]]

The conference proceedings were published in an award-winning volume edited by Elizabeth Simpson (Harry N. Abrams, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Elizabeth. ''The Spoils of War--World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property''. New York: [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]] in association with the Bard Graduate Center, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes 17 treaties, conventions, and other official documents relating to the protection and return of cultural property. These begin with the "[[Lieber Code]]" of 1863 and the "[[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]]," and continue with the treaties following World War I, the "[[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954]]" for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]]" on the prevention of illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects]] of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention |title=Cultural Property - 1995 Convention - Unidroit - International Institute for the Unification of Private Law - Institut International pour l'Unification du droit privè |publisher=Unidroit |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses resulting from World War II==
Elizabeth Simpson and lawyer Jeanette Greenfield, author of ''The Return of Cultural Treasures'',&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette. ''The Return of Cultural Treasures.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; provided introductory comments on the subject, along with [[Lynn H. Nicholas|Lynn Nicholas]], author of ''The Rape of Europa'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn. ''The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War''. New York: Vintage Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; who discussed the massive displacement of art and cultural property that occurred during World War II. Individual countries detailed the damage to their national patrimony, as well as losses suffered by individuals. A talk on Jewish ceremonial art and private property was given by Vivian Mann, then Chair of Judaica at [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|The Jewish Museum]], New York. These reports were followed by a series of contributions on laws, directives, and conventions in place at the beginning of World War II, directives in force in Germany during the war, and laws enacted by the Allies to counter German appropriations. These and all the conference presentations are published in the proceedings (see list of contributors below).

==The "Monuments Men"==
[[File:Capt Edith Standen at Central Collecting Point Wiesbaden 1946.jpg|thumb|Captain Edith Standen at the Wiesbaden Collecting Point, 1946.]]A group of the so-called [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art|"Monuments Men"]] (which in fact included several women) detailed their firsthand accounts of the work of the art-specialist officers of the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumentsmen.com |title=Official Site |publisher=The Monuments Men |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section]] of the [[Office of Military Government, United States]], recounted the discovery of [[looted art]] and stashed bullion in German mines, bunkers, castles, and churches, along with the redistribution and repatriation of these finds through the Munich and Wiesbaden Collecting Points. Of the veteran officers speaking the New York conference—James S. Plaut (d. 1996), [[Walter Farmer|Walter I. Farmer]] (d. 1997), [[Edith Standen|Edith A. Standen]] (d. 1998), [[Craig Hugh Smyth]] (d. 2006), [[S. Lane Faison]] (d. 2006), and Bernard Taper (d. 2016)—none survives today.

==Reappearance and recovery==
Other repatriations occurred at the end of the war, effected by the US State Department, the USSR, and other countries. Case studies include fascinating discussions of the [[Theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg Church Treasures]], the Soviet Secret Repositories,&lt;ref&gt;Akinsha, Konstantin, Grigorii Kozlov, and Sylvia Hochfield. ''Beautiful Loot: The Soviet Plunder of Europe's Art Treasures'', New York: Random House, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Treasure of Priam," which was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann at Troy in 1873, shipped out of Turkey illegally by Schliemann, ended up in Berlin, transferred to Moscow by the Soviet Trophy Brigades after the fall of Berlin, held in secret in the Pushkin Museum, and finally brought out of the secret repository and exhibited in the museum in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, Vladimir, and Mikhail Treister. ''The Gold of Troy: Searching for Homer’s Fabled City''. Moscow and New York: Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in association with Harry N. Abrams, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims to ownership of the Trojan treasures by Turkey, Germany, and Greece, the objects remain in Moscow with the issue unresolved.[[File:Sophia Schliemann wearing Treasure A, Troy.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|Heinrich Schliemann's wife, Sophia, wearing gold jewelry from Treasure A, Troy, ca. 1873.]]

==Current issues and cooperative efforts==
The conference concluded with a series of presentations on current and proposed efforts to mitigate the losses suffered. Lyndel Prott, then Chief of the International Standards Section of the Cultural Heritage Division of [[UNESCO]], offered a list of "Principles for the Resolution of Disputes Concerning Cultural Heritage Displaced during the Second World War":

# Cultural objects that have been taken from territory occupied during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War by any belligerent will be returned to the country from which they have been taken.
#Where there have been successive displacements, the objects will be returned to the territory where they were located at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939.
#Principle 1 will apply whether  transfers of the cultural objects concerned have taken the form of open looting or plunder, or of transactions apparently legal in form, even when they purport to have been voluntarily effected.
#Cultural property taken from an occupied territory shall never be detained as war reparations.
#Where cultural objects displaced during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War have passed into the hands of third parties, the state that is responsible for their removal from the country where they were located in 1939 shall reacquire them for return to the state from which they were taken, by repurchase, indemnity or other appropriate means.
#No time limits can be set.
#Cultural objects being repatriated are to be accompanied by the relevant scientific documentation where available.
#Restitution by replacement is an available remedy where unique cultural objects have been destroyed.

==Press coverage and controversy==
The "Spoils of War" symposium was covered extensively in the international press, including articles carried by the [[Associated Press]] and in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''New York [[Newsday]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Die Zeit]]'', and ''[[Pravda]]''. The [[The Forward|''Jewish Forward'']] published a critique that appeared on the first day of the conference; at issue was whether or not the conference gave sufficient weight to Jewish wartime losses, since these losses were detailed within the greater context of the Second World War and the damages experienced by the peoples of the many nations involved.

[[File:Amber Room Catherine Palace Tsarskoye Selo pre-war photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The original [[Amber Room]] in the [[Catherine Palace]], Pushkin (Tsarskoye Selo), Russia, in an early 20th century photograph before it was lost as a result of the Second World War.]]This issue sparked a second conference in Washington, DC, in 1998. Sponsored by the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the "Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembled participants from the New York symposium along with others to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets. This resulted in a further set of "[[Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/122038.htm |title=Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art |publisher=State.gov |date=1998-12-03 |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by organizer [[Stuart E. Eizenstat]], as well as "Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/decl.htm |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York conference has remained influential, however, due to its broader scope—dealing as it did with losses that occurred throughout Europe, inflicted not only by the Germans but also by the Soviets and western Allies, and affecting all those peoples who suffered as a result of the Second World War. The volume of conference proceedings was reviewed widely by publications in the United States and Europe, as well as ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''[[Yeni Yüzyıl]]'', [[Russian News Agency TASS|''ITAR-TASS'']], and others. As the only comprehensive treatment of the subject, it is cited frequently, considered one of the most important books on World War II and its aftermath—and the loss, reappearance, and recovery of cultural property relating to the war.

{{For|other types of typology|Typology (disambiguation)}}


'''Typology''' (in urban planning and architecture) is the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] classification of (usually physical) characteristics commonly found in buildings and urban places, according to their association with different categories, such as intensity of development (from natural or rural to highly urban), degrees of formality, and school of thought (for example, modernist or traditional).  Individual characteristics form patterns.  Patterns relate elements hierarchically across physical scales (from small details to large systems). 

For an authoritative essay on Typology in urban planning and architecture, see Rafael Moneo's 1978 Essay 'On Typology', published in Oppositions magazine. In this article the history of the notion of type is traced from its origins in the French Enlightenment until the late 20th century.

The following is an example of a set of characteristics with typological associations:&lt;br /&gt;  

[[Single-family detached home]]s set well back from a street on large [[land lot|lots]] (about, one-fifth acre to two or more acres) and surrounded by mowed lawns with naturalistic ornamental plantings of trees and shrubs are associated typologically with North American [[suburban]] places.&lt;br /&gt; 

Single-family residences that come all the way forward on an individual lot so that the front of the building is coincident with front lot line, or which are set back only a few feet to accommodate a lightwell or front entry stoop, are associated typologically with highly urbanized places in North America.  

An emphasis on typology is characteristic of [[New Urbanism]].  New Urbanists believe it is important to match the physical development characteristics of a place within the appropriate typology for that place, as determined by local preferences taken in context with urban patterns as evidenced throughout history.  Modernists, in keeping with their general disinclination to keep within the constraints of tradition and hierarchies of patterns, are less likely to focus on identifying the correct typology of a site.

'''Variantology''' has been conceived as an international research project with the aim of developing a critical appraisal of the established concepts of “[[Mass media|media]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://variantology.com/|title=Vilém Flusser Archiv|website=Variantology.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a medium is thus opened up to approaches and disciplines that up to now have remained outside the contemporary discourse on media, such as [[theology]], various [[musicology]], aspects of [[natural sciences]], [[fine arts]] or [[classical philology]]. Furthermore, it is opened up to cultures of knowledge that have long been excluded from the western discourse, like the oriental and Arabic-Islamic culture. Variantology also attempts to explore how reciprocally these disciplines then become open to thinking in categories and terms of media and [[communication]]. Consequently, the network of research that constitutes the Variantology project involves scholars based in academic institutions as well as artists, musicians and authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entropie.digital.udk-berlin.de/wiki/Variantology]  {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711031153/http://entropie.digital.udk-berlin.de/wiki/Variantology |date=2012-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical basis ==
To come to a different understanding of media, a central part of research is the development of a network of scientists, artists and scholars who are engaged with the "deep time relations“ between arts, sciences, and technologies. The term "deep time relations“ refers to the notion of being a plurality of traversals through the genealogy of what we call media today.&lt;ref&gt;"Deep Time" is a term coined in palaeontological studies, especially by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[John McPhee]].&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying theoretical center is [[Michel Foucault]]’s concept of genealogy,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Nietzsche, Genealogy, History.” in: Paul Rabinow (Editor). The Foucault Reader. Vintage. 1984. {{ISBN|0-394-71340-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he developed from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]’s thinking about morality as a historical- and social-generated construction.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. On the Genealogy of Morals. Oxford University Press. 2009. {{ISBN|0-19-953708-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault's approach in this connection was to comprehend history as a constitution of knowledge, of discourses, of objectification and so on, detached from an idea of historical subjects and previously unquestioned categories of western (Eurocentric) culture and power.

== Workshops and publications ==
An integral part of the project is the annual international workshop. The first three Variantology workshops were held at [[Academy of Media Arts Cologne]], the fourth one at [[UdK]] in Berlin, and the 5th at [[Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III]] in Naples, Italy.

'''VinylPlus''' was founded by the European Council of Vinyl Manufacturers (ECVM), the European Stabiliser Producers Association (ESPA), European Plasticisers and the European Plastics Converters (EuPC) in 2011 when the [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] industry renewed a previous initiative called Vinyl 2010. VinylPlus is a ten-year, industry-wide voluntary commitment to develop more ecologically responsible ways to produce, use and recycle PVC. The programme aligns with the principles and targets of the [[United Nations|UN]]’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) and the [[circular economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=91|title=VinylPlus - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VinylPlus includes all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters and recyclers. It covers the EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland.

VinylPlus is included in the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]] Registry of Commitments, and is a member of the Green Industry Platform, the global partnership led by the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)]] and the United Nations Environment Platform Programme (UNEP). VinylPlus is also registered as a partner on the UN Partnerships for SDGs platform where it is recognised as fulfilling the SMART criteria. 

== History ==
VinylPlus succeeded Vinyl 2010, which was the European PVC industry’s first voluntary commitment. Vinyl 2010 was set up in 2000 around the principles of [[Responsible Care]] adopted by the European chemicals industry in the 1980s . Its programme aimed to shift the PVC industry to a more sustainable model by improving recycling and substituting hazardous additives.

At the same time, the [[European Union]] also started addressing environmental concerns about plastics, notably developing the [[Waste framework directive|Waste Framework Directive]] (EU Directive 2008/98/EC), which laid down key EU recycling rules.

Vinyl 2010 also set up a monitoring committee, which was kept upon the creation of VinylPlus. The committee was designed as an independent verification of the programme’s activities, and includes representatives from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], trade unions, consumer associations, academia and members of the European 

== Progress Report ==
VinylPlus publishes an annual Progress Report summarising progress and data. Progress is measured against each of the five sustainability challenges identified for PVC. All information included in the report is presented to the Monitoring Committee and independently audited by third parties.

== Product Label ==
The VinylPlus Product Label was launched in 2018 as an identification tool.

== Recycling ==
One aspect of the programme is to Improve recycling figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vinylplus.eu/recycling/circular-economy|title=VinylPlus - The Circular Economy|website=vinylplus.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum ==
VinylPlus organises an annual forum: The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum. The first one took place in Istanbul in 2013. The event aims to encourage dialogue on sustainability by assembling representatives from the PVC industry, policy makers, consumer groups, retailers, architects, designers, recyclers and NGOs.  The themes from past forums have been:

* 2013: Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth for Europe and Beyond
* 2014: Enhancing the Value of Partnerships
* 2015: More Vinyl, Less Carbon
* 2016: Smart Vinyl For Our Cities
* 2017: Towards Circular Economy
* 2018: Meeting Societal Needs

== Governance ==
VinylPlus’s management Board represents all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters. The Monitoring Committee offers guidance and advice, while ensuring an independent evaluation of the initiatives undertaken in the Voluntary Commitment. The Monitoring Committee currently includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, trade unions, consumer associations and academia, as well as representatives from the European PVC industry. The Monitoring Committee’s stated goal is to ensure VinylPlus’s transparency, participation and accountability. 

== Affiliates ==
==== Recovinyl ====
The Recovinyl  programme was set up in 2003 as part of Vinyl 2010’s commitment. Its original mission was to advance waste collection and recycling schemes. When the Vinyl 2010 programme ended, it was given a dual role under the new VinylPlus initiative. While Recovinyl still encourages PVC recycling, it also aims to optimise resource efficiency by acting as an intermediary between recyclers and converters.

==== Vinyl Foundation ==== 
The Vinyl Foundation is the non-profit organisation that manages the funds from the European PVC product manufacturers, compounders and raw material traders that support VinylPlus.

[[File:The New Testament in the original Greek - 1881.djvu|thumb|page=9]]
'''''The New Testament in the Original Greek''''' is a Greek-language version of the [[New Testament]] published in 1881. It is also known as the '''Westcott and Hort''' text, after its editors [[Brooke Foss Westcott]] (1825–1901) and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]] (1828–1892). (Textual scholars use the abbreviation "'''WH'''".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;)
It is a [[Textual criticism|critical text]], compiled from some of the oldest New Testament fragments and texts that had been discovered at the time. The two editors worked together for 28 years.

Westcott and Hort state: "[It is] our belief that even among the numerous unquestionably spurious readings of the New Testament there are no signs of deliberate falsification of the text for dogmatic purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort, '[https://books.google.com/books?id=0xtVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=ACfU3U33CMW3331Vv20NgGvjyOs52I1mlA&amp;vq=%22will+not+be+out+of+place+to+add+here+a+distinct+expression+of+our+belief+that+even+among+the+numerous%22&amp;source=gbs_quotes_r&amp;cad=2_0#PPA283,M1 'The New Testament in the Original Greek: Introduction, Appendix''], p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; 
They find that without orthographic differences, doubtful textual variants exist only in one sixtieth of the whole New Testament (with most of them being comparatively trivial variations), with the substantial variations forming hardly more than one thousandth of the entire text.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Westcott and Hort|title=The New Testament in the Original Greek: Introduction Appendix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=The+New+Testament+in+the+Original+Greek&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hort, "Knowledge of Documents should precede Final Judgments upon Readings". The two editors favoured two manuscripts: [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]]. They also believed that the combination of [[Codex Bezae]] with the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] and the [[Peshitta|Old Syriac]] represents the original form of the New Testament text, especially when it is shorter than other forms of the text, such as the majority of the [[Byzantine text-type]].&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;{{Cite book | last = Aland | first = Kurt | authorlink = Kurt Aland |author2=[[Barbara Aland]] |translator=Erroll F.

Eerdmans Publishing Company|Wm. B. Eerdmans]] | year = 1995 | location = Grand Rapids | page = 236}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In this they followed one of the primary principles of their fledgling textual criticism, ''[[lectio brevior]]'', sometimes taken to an extreme, as in the theory of [[Western non-interpolations]], which has since been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Aland, Kurt and Barbara. ''The Text of the New Testament'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1995, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

== WH edition ==
[[File:Wyh.jpg|thumb|[[Brooke Foss Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]]]]

Westcott and Hort distinguished four text types in their studies. The most recent is the Syrian, or [[Byzantine text-type]] (eastern), of which the newest example is the [[Textus Receptus]] and thus from the critical text view is less likely reliable. The [[Western text-type]] is much older, but tends to paraphrase, so according to the critical text view also lacks dependability. The [[Alexandrian text-type]], exemplified in the [[Codex Ephraemi]], exhibits a polished Greek style. The two scholars identified their favorite text type as "Neutral text", exemplified by two 4th-century manuscripts, the [[Codex Vaticanus]] (known to scholars since the 15th century), and the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] (discovered in 1859), both of which they relied on heavily (albeit not exclusively) for this edition. This text has only a few changes of the original.&lt;ref name = Schumacher&gt;H. Schumacher, A Handbook of Scripture Study (B. Herder Book Co.: St. Louis-London 1923), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition is based on the critical works especially of Tischendorf and Tregelles.&lt;ref name = Schumacher/&gt; The minuscules play a minimal role in this edition.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Holmes, ''From Nestle to the `Editio Critica Maior`'', in: ''The Bible as Book: The Transmission of the Greek Text'', London 2003, p. 128. {{ISBN|0-7123-4727-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westcott and Hort worked on their Testament from 1853 until its completion in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M. Metzger |last2=Ehrman |first2=Bart D. |authorlink2=Bart D. Ehrman |title=The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York – Oxford|url= |isbn=978-0-19-516122-9 |page= 174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by an ''Introduction and Appendix'' by Hort appearing in a second volume in 1882. In 1892, a revised edition was released by [[Francis Crawford Burkitt|F. C. Burkitt]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Reception ==

The edition of Westcott and Hort began a new epoch in the history of textual criticism.&lt;ref name = Schumacher/&gt; Most critical editions published after Westcott and Hort share their preference of the Alexandrian text-type and therefore are similar to ''The New Testament in the Original Greek''. An exception is the text edited by [[Hermann von Soden]]. Soden's edition stands much closer to the text of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]] than to the text of Westcott and Hort. All editions of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]] remain close in textual character to the text WH. [[Kurt Aland|Aland]] reports that, while NA25 text shows, for example, 2,047 differences from von Soden, 1,996 from Vogels, 1,268 from Tischendorf, 1,161 from Bover, and 770 from Merk, it contains only 558 differences from WH text.&lt;ref&gt;K. Aland &amp; B. Aland, ''Text of the New Testament'', pp. 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bruce M. Metzger]], "the general validity of their critical principles and procedures is widely acknowledged by scholars today."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1981 Metzger said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The international committee that produced the ''United Bible Societies'' Greek New Testament, not only adopted the Westcott and Hort edition as its basic text, but followed their methodology in giving attention to both external and internal consideration”.&lt;ref&gt;B. M. Metzger, cited by James Brooks, ''Bible Interpreters of the 20th century'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Comfort]] gave this opinion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The text produced by Westcott and Hort is still to this day, even with so many more manuscript discoveries, a very close reproduction of the primitive text of the New Testament. Of course, I think they gave too much weight to Codex Vaticanus alone, and this needs to be tempered. This criticism aside, the Westcott and Hort text is extremely reliable. (...) In many instances where I would disagree with the wording in the Nestle / UBS text in favor of a particular variant reading, I would later check with the Westcott and Hort text and realize that they had often come to the same decision. (...) Of course, the manuscript discoveries of the past one hundred years have changed things, but it is remarkable how often they have affirmed the decisions of Westcott and Hort.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Comfort, ''Encountering the Manuscripts: An Introduction to New Testament Paleography &amp; Textual Criticism'', (Nashville, 2005), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other editions of Greek New Testament ==

The texts of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]], and of Bover and Merk, differ very little from the text of the Westcott-Hort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/TextTypes.html#Use Robert Waltz]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in musicology''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women professors, scholars and researchers]] in [[postsecondary education]] [[musicology]] departments at [[postsecondary education]] institutions, including [[university|universities]], [[college]]s and [[Music conservatory|music conservatories]]. Traditionally, the vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She  has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013.

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1957) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]]  known for her studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[music]] and [[culture]].]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Its origins date back to the Rio de Janeiro [[Earth Summit]] of 1992,&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt; when [[Stephan Schmidheiny]], a Swiss business entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memo to Rio+20: 'green economy' doesn't mean monetising nature|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/29/rio-20-green-economy-monetising-nature|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created a forum called "Business Council for Sustainable Development", which went on to become ''Changing Course'', a book that coined the concept of [[eco-efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eco-Efficiency|url=http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/business/ecoeffic.shtml|website=www.smartcommunities.ncat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBCSD was created in 1995 in a merger of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Industry Council for the Environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= THE ICC &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT|url=http://archive.corporateeurope.org/icc/icc_environment.html|website=archive.corporateeurope.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based at the [[Maison de la paix]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/globalwarming/n721.xml|website=knowledge.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offices in New York and New Delhi.

==Operations==
The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are Circular Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Circular-Economy|title=Circular Economy - World business council for sustainable development|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cities and Mobility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Cities-and-Mobility|title=Cities and Mobility|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Climate and Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy|title=Energy &amp; Circular Economy|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Food, Land and Water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Food-Land-Water|title=Food, Land &amp; Water|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/People|title=People|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Redefining Value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Redefining-Value|title=Redefining Value|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A 2003 [[World Bank]]/[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]] commissioned study  identified the WBCSD as one of the "most influential forums" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcesaver.org/file/toolmanager/CustomO16C45F49313.pdf Race to the Top: Attracting and Enabling Global Sustainable Business]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[Globescan]] survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surveys.globescan.com/sdroleaders/sose04-2_resorg.pdf 2004 Globescan Survey of Sustainability Experts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a "major role" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpi.cam.ac.uk/PDF/Aug%202006.pdf Cambridge Sustainability Research Digest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007's [[Ethisphere Institute]] list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked 9th, which made him the 2nd most influential NGO leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethisphere.com/influential/ 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210162230/http://ethisphere.com/influential/ |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to [[sustainable development]]. Among its over 180 members&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members&lt;/ref&gt; are well-known companies such as [[DuPont]], [[3M]], [[Nestlé]], [[BP]], [[Danone]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. WBCSD provides its members with the '''value, impact and voice''' to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental.

A key element is the personal commitment of the [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officers]] (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD’s policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD’s work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies.

===Forética===
Forética claims to be global network of [[Spanish language|Spanish speaking]] businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to [[ISO 26000]] and supported by [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csr-supplychain.org/ CSR Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/eNews/eNewsDetails.aspx?ID=16293&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Leading Spanish think-tank Forética joins WBCSD’s Global Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

According to Greenpeace the ''World Business Council for Sustainable Development '' is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the [[climate change]] and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest nonrenewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a ‘Who’s Who’ of the world’s largest carbon-intensive companies.&lt;ref name=GP2010&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/391%20-%20WhosHoldingUsBack.pdf Who's holding us back?Full report] November 23, 2011 page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sierra Club]] has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/rocky-mountain-chapter/calendar-2 |title=Calendar &amp;#124; Sierra Club |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austineconetwork.com/content/austin-sierra-club-monthly-meeting |title=Austin Sierra Club monthly meeting &amp;#124; Austin EcoNetwork |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Defense Fund]] recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/GHG_roadmap_Final.pdf |title=www.edf.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/biofuels-sustainability-certification-report.pdf |title=Biofuel Sustainability Performance Guidelines |accessdate=2015-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WBCSC's Vision 2020 report was highlighted by [[The Guardian]] as "the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-world-business-council |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development: Vision 2050 &amp;#124; Guardian Sustainable Business &amp;#124; The Guardian |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Writing material''' refers to the materials that provide the surfaces on which humans use [[writing instruments]] to  inscribe writings. The same materials can also be used for [[symbol]]ic or [[Representation (arts)|representational]] [[drawing]]s. [[Building material]] on which writings or drawings are produced are not included. The gross characterization of writing materials is by the material constituting the writing surface (for example, [[paper]]) and the number, size, and usage and storage configuration of multiple surfaces (for example, paper sheets) into a single object (for example, a [[spiral notebook]]). Writing materials are often paired with specific types of writing instruments. Other important attributes of a writing material are its reusability, its permanence, and its resistance to fraudulent misuse.

==Archaeology==
Because drawing preceded writing, the first remains of writing materials are the [[Rock (geology)|stone]] walls of the caves on which the famous images were drawn. Another precursor were [[tally stick]]s used to record the count of objects or the passage of discrete units of time ([[days]]). Tally sticks have been found made of [[wood]] and of [[bone]]. Knotted ropes and similar materials were also used for tallies. Such materials did not take a great deal of preparation for their use for drawing or writing. Animal [[Hide (skin)|hides]] also had potential for use as a material for writing or drawing, although the drawings and writings may have been decorative or to convey status or religious meaning. Among the barks of trees, [[birch bark]] is very well suited for use as a writing material and was so used both in Northern Europe and among native peoples in North America.

Four other classes of material were sometimes used for writing: [[clay]], [[wax]], [[cloth]], and [[metal]]. The value of metal for useful implements may have made it less than useful for practical writing and drawing. The very hardness of many metals that made them useful also made it an inconvenient material for many kinds of writing. But foils or sheets of soft metals like lead were usable. Lead sheets were used for [[curse tablets]], as well as personal correspondence.

Cloth probably shared its mode of use with animal skins. Clay introduces the useful combination of extreme ease of making the inscription with the potential for rendering it fairly permanent. Unglazed pottery can readily accept inscription even after firing. Wax offers another novel combination of advantage: a reusable surface, easily inscribed and erased, and easy combination with materials like wood that give it durability. [[Stone tablets]], clay and wooden writing tablets, and [[Wax tablet|wax-covered wooden tablets]] are some of the first specialized configurations of materials in flat surfaces specifically for writing.

Unglazed pottery shards were used almost as a kind of scratch paper, as [[ostraka]], for tax receipts and, in Athens, to record the individual nominations of Greek leaders for [[ostracism]].

The archaeological record contains either examples of these materials used for drawing or writing or it has indirect indications of their use for writing, drawing, or tallying.

==Common writing materials of the Middle Ages==
In western civilisations, early use of [[papyrus]] was soon replaced by [[parchment]] made by treating animal hide. A wide variety of parchments from various animal skins, with different texture, quality and hue were widely used for codices, religious and cultural texts. This was replaced by the advent and increasing access and availability of [[paper]].

In eastern civilisations such as [[India]], the principal writing media were [[birch bark]] or ''bhurjapatra'' (Sanskrit) and [[palm leaf manuscript|dried palm leaves]]. The use of paper began only after the 10th century. However birch bark and palm leaf continue to be used even today on a limited scale in a rural milieu for the use of horoscopes, wedding invitations and other cultural uses.

In China, the early material was animal bones, later silk, [[bamboo and wooden slips]], until the 2nd century when [[paper]] was invented.

==History==
Writing seems to have become more widespread with the invention of [[papyrus]] in Egypt. [[Parchment]], using sheepskins left after the wool was removed for cloth, was sometimes cheaper than papyrus, which had to be imported outside Egypt. With the invention of [[wood-pulp paper]], the cost of writing material began a steady decline.

==Printing==
The dramatic increase in demand foray paper associated with the [[printing press]] stimulated dramatic cost reduction efforts. Specialized materials developed for printing have also been made available for writing. The invention of the [[typewriter]] was a major step, making possible reliable production of legible written materials by organizations and individual writers.

==Electronic media==
Electronic media have utilized the keyboard developed for the typewriter, electrical and electronic circuitry and storage devices, and the viewing screen developed for reading electronic signals to separate the medium for writing from the medium for reading.
