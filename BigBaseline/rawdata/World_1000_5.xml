They noted that raw food eaten by the patient may have been contaminated by rats. In 1955, Mackerass and Sanders identified the lifecycle of the worm in rats, defining snails and slugs as the intermediate hosts and noting the path of transmission through the blood, brain, and lungs in rats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Epidemiology and pathogenesis==
Following World War II, ''A. cantonensis'' spread throughout Southeast Asia and Western Pacific Islands, including [[Australia]], [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Polynesia]]. Cases were soon reported in [[New Caledonia]], the [[Philippines]],  [[Rarotonga]], [[Saipan]], [[Sumatra]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Tahiti]]. In the 1960s, even more cases were reported from the region from locations such as [[Cambodia]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Java]], [[Thailand]], [[Sarawak]], [[Vietnam]], and the New Hebrides ([[Vanuatu]]).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|title=EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS|last=|first=|date=2018-03-09|website=louisiana.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615214313/http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-15|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] study of eosinophilic meningitis in humans was conducted by Rosen, Laigret, and Bories, who hypothesized that the parasite causing these infections was carried by fish. However, Alicata noted that raw fish was consumed by large numbers of people in Hawaii without apparent consequences, and patients presenting with meningitis symptoms had a history of eating raw snails or [[prawn]]s in the weeks before presenting with symptoms. This observation, along with epidemiology and [[autopsy]] of infected brains, confirmed ''A. cantonensis'' infection in humans as the cause of the majority of eosinophilic meningitis cases in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alicata|first=J.E.|title=The discovery of Angiostrongylus cantonensis as a cause of human eosinophilic meningitis|journal=Parasitology Today|volume=7|issue=6|pages=151–153|doi=10.1016/0169-4758(91)90285-v|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, cases of ''A. cantonensis'' infestations have appeared in  [[American Samoa]], Australia, [[Hong Kong]], [[Bombay]], [[Fiji]], Hawaii, [[Honshu]], [[India]], [[Kyushu]], [[New Britain]], [[Okinawa]], [[Ryukyu Islands]], [[Western Samoa]], and most recently mainland [[China]]. Other sporadic occurrences of the parasite in its rat hosts have been reported in [[Cuba]], [[Egypt]], [[Louisiana]], [[Madagascar]], [[Nigeria]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2013, ''A. cantonensis'' was confirmed present in [[Florida]], USA, where its range and prevalence are expanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwanowicz DD, Sanders LR, Schill WB, Xayavong MV, da Silva AJ, Qvarnstrom Y, Smith T | title = Spread of the Rat Lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) in Giant African Land Snails (Lissachatina fulica) in Florida, USA | journal = Journal of Wildlife Diseases | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 749–53 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25973628 | doi = 10.7589/2014-06-160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a case was found in a [[New York City|New Yorker]], who had visited Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2-new-lungworm-cases-involves-n-y-teen-vacationed-hawaii-article-1.3931066|title=New York teen contracts rat lungworm during Hawaii vacation|last=|first=|date=|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413052417/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2-new-lungworm-cases-involves-n-y-teen-vacationed-hawaii-article-1.3931066|archive-date=2018-04-13|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the parasite has been shown to be proliferating at an alarming rate due to modern food-consumption trends and global transportation of food products. Scientists are calling for a more thorough study of the epidemiology of ''A. cantonensis'', stricter food-safety policies, and the increase of knowledge on how to properly consume products commonly infested by the parasite, such as snails and slugs that act as intermediate hosts or those that act as [[Host (biology)#Paratenic hosts|paratenic hosts]], such as fish, frogs, or [[Fresh water|freshwater]] prawns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lv S, Zhang Y, Steinmann P, Zhou XN | title = Emerging angiostrongyliasis in Mainland China | language = en-us | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–4 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18258099 | pmc = 2600175 | doi = 10.3201/eid1401.061529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alicata|first=Joseph E.|date=1967|title=Effect of Freezing and Boiling on the Infectivity of Third-Stage Larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonensis Present in Land Snails and Freshwater Prawns|jstor=3276839|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1064–1066|doi=10.2307/3276839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ash|first=Lawrence R.|date=1968|title=The Occurrence of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in Frogs of New Caledonia with Observations on Paratenic Hosts of Metastrongyles|jstor=3277060|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=54|issue=3|pages=432–436|doi=10.2307/3277060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingestion of food items that can be contaminated by the mucus excretions of intermediate or paratenic hosts, such as snails and slugs or by the feces of rats that act as definitive hosts, can lead to infection of ''A. cantonensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richards CS, Merritt JW | title = Studies on Angiostrongylus cantonensis in molluscan intermediate hosts | journal = The Journal of Parasitology | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 382–8 | date = April 1967 | pmid = 6022396 | doi = 10.2307/3276595 | jstor = 3276595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common route of infection of  ''A. cantonesis'' in humans is by ingestion of either intermediate or paratenic hosts of the [[larva]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell BG, Little MD | title = The finding of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in rats in New Orleans | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 568–73 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 3275136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unwashed fruits and vegetables, especially [[romaine lettuce]], can be contaminated with snail and slug mucus or can result in accidental ingestion of these intermediate and paratenic hosts.

==Pathogenesis of human angiostrongylosis==
The presence of parasitic worms burrowed in the neural tissue of the human [[central nervous system]] will cause obvious complications. All of the following will result in damage to the CNS:{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

# Toxic byproducts such as nitrogenous waste
# [[Antigen]]s released by dead and living parasites

==Eosinophilic meningitis==
{{See also|Eosinophilic meningitis}}
Although the clinical disease caused by ''Angiostrongylus'' invasion into the central nervous system is commonly referred to as "eosinophilic meningitis", the actual pathophysiology is of a meningoencephalitis with invasion not just of the [[meninges]], or superficial lining of the brain, but also deeper brain tissue. Initial invasion through the lining of the brain, the meninges, may cause a typical inflammation of the meninges and a classic meningitis picture of headache, stiff neck, and often fever. The parasites subsequently invade deeper into the brain tissue, causing specific localizing [[Neurological disorder|neurologic]] symptoms depending on where in the brain [[parenchyma]] they migrate. Neurologic findings and symptoms wax and wane as initial damage is done by the physical in-migration of the worms and secondary damage is done by the inflammatory response to the presence of dead and dying worms. This inflammation can lead in the short term to paralysis, bladder dysfunction, visual disturbance, and coma and in the long term to permanent nerve damage, mental retardation, nerve damage, permanent brain damage, or death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang QP, Lai DH, Zhu XQ, Chen XG, Lun ZR | title = Human angiostrongyliasis | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 621–30 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18922484 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70229-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eosinophilic meningitis is commonly defined by the increased number of [[eosinophil]]s in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). In most cases, eosinophil levels rise to 10 or more eosinophils per μl in the CSF, accounting for at least 10% of the total CSF [[White blood cell|leukocyte]] (white blood cell) count.&lt;ref name="urlwww.dhh.louisiana.gov"&gt;[http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf "EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS"]. Revised 28 February 2006, accessed 1 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical analysis of the CSF typically resembles the findings in "[[aseptic meningitis]]" with slightly elevated protein levels, normal glucose levels, and negative bacterial cultures. Presence of a significantly decreased glucose on CSF analysis is an indicator of severe [[meningoencephalitis]] and may indicate a poor [[Prognosis|medical outcome]]. Initial CSF analysis early in the disease process may occasionally show no increase of eosinophils, only to have classical increases in eosinophils in subsequent CSF analysis. Caution should be advised in using eosinophilic meningitis as the only criterion for diagnosing angiostrongylus infestation in someone with classic symptoms, as the disease evolves with the migration of the worms into the CNS.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Eosinophils are specialized white blood cells of the [[Granulocyte|granulocytic]] cell line which contain granules in their [[cytoplasm]]. These granules contain proteins that are toxic to parasites. When these granules degranulate, or break down, chemicals are released that combat parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Eosinophils, which are located throughout the body, are guided to sites of inflammation by [[chemokine]]s when the body is infested with parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Once at the site of inflammation, type 2 cytokines are released from [[T helper cell|helper T cells]], which communicate with the eosinophils, signaling them to activate. Once activated, eosinophils can begin the process of [[degranulation]], releasing their toxic [[protein]]s in the fight against the foreign parasite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Clinical signs and symptoms===
According to a group [[case study]], the most common symptoms in mild eosinophilic meningitis tend to be headache (with 100% of people in the study suffering from this symptom), [[photophobia]] or visual disturbance (92%), neck stiffness (83%), fatigue (83%), [[hyperesthesia]]s (75%), vomiting (67%), and [[paresthesia]]s (50%).&lt;ref name="Murphy 35–40" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Incubation period]] is often 3 weeks, but can be 3–36 days&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and even 80 days.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tseng YT, Tsai HC, Sy CL, Lee SS, Wann SR, Wang YH, Chen JK, Wu KS, Chen YS | title = Clinical manifestations of eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis: 18 years' experience in a medical center in southern Taiwan | journal = Journal of Microbiology, Immunology, and Infection = Wei Mian Yu Gan Ran Za Zhi | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 382–9 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21524976 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmii.2011.01.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The severity and clinical course of ''Angiostrongylus'' disease depends significantly on the ingested load of third-stage [[larva]]e,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai HC, Liu YC, Kunin CM, Lee SS, Chen YS, Lin HH, Tsai TH, Lin WR, Huang CK, Yen MY, Yen CM | title = Eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis: report of 17 cases | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–14 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11498063 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9343(01)00766-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; creating great variability from case to case, making clinical trials difficult to design, and  effectiveness of treatments difficult to discern. Typical conservative medical management including [[analgesic]]s and [[sedative]]s provide minimal relief for the headaches and hyperesthesias. Removing cerebrospinal fluid at regular 3- to 7-day intervals is the only proven method of significantly reducing [[intracranial pressure]] and can be used for symptomatic treatment of headaches.&lt;ref name="Slom 668–675"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slom TJ, Cortese MM, Gerber SI, Jones RC, Holtz TH, Lopez AS, Zambrano CH, Sufit RL, Sakolvaree Y, Chaicumpa W, Herwaldt BL, Johnson S | title = An outbreak of eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis in travelers returning from the Caribbean | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 346 | issue = 9 | pages = 668–75 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11870244 | doi = 10.1056/nejmoa012462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnosis ===
The diagnosis of disease caused by ''A. cantonensis'' infestation is often difficult and relies heavily on the history of a likely ingestion of a commonly infested host and the presence of typical features of the disease. The presumptive diagnosis is particularly strong when eosinophilic meningoencephalitis can be confirmed. The diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis can be arrived at through detection of elevated cranial pressure and increased numbers of eosinophils. The diagnosis of the cause of eosinophilic meningitis and the presence of ''A. cantonensis'' is remarkably more difficult. A [[Lumbar puncture|spinal tap]], or a sample of CSF, must be taken to search for ''A. cantonensis'' worms or larvae. ''A. cantonensis'' is undetectable in the CSF of more than half of the infected individuals. Current methods of detecting specific antigens associated with ''A. cantonensis'' are also unreliable. Consequently, alternative approaches to detect antigen-[[antibody]] reactions are being explored, such as [[Agglutination-PCR|immuno-PCR]].&lt;ref name="urlImmuno-PCR for Detection of Antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis Circulating Fifth-Stage Worms -- Chye et al. 50 (1): 51 -- Clinical Chemistry"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chye SM, Lin SR, Chen YL, Chung LY, Yen CM | title = Immuno-PCR for detection of antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis circulating fifth-stage worms | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–7 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14709636 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2003.020867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rapid dot-blot [[ELISA|ELISA test]] is also available for quick, effective, and economical on-site diagnosis of  ''A. cantonensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eamsobhana P, Yong HS | title = Immunological diagnosis of human angiostrongyliasis due to Angiostrongylus cantonensis (Nematoda: Angiostrongylidae) | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–31 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19117782 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2008.09.021 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971208016834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort lasted from 1982 to the 1990s, and generally coincides with [[James P. Grant]]'s tenure as executive director of UNICEF (1980–1995). The child survival revolution included various programs and conferences, including the [[World Summit for Children]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=gautam/&gt;

Rather than treating child mortality as a measurement of development, the effort sought to directly reduce child mortality as a way toward development.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/1980s.htm |title=The 1980s: Campaign for child survival |publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations, including the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[UNDP]], the [[World Bank]], and [[WHO]] joined; thus the revolution is sometimes called "a grand alliance for children".&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt; The revolution was analogized with the [[Green Revolution]] by James Grant.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|42}}

==Results and reception==
The initial reaction to Grant's announcement of the child survival revolution was overwhelmingly negative due to several reasons, including practical reasons, e.g., the money and infrastructure to support Grant's plans not existing.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|24}}

It is estimated that the child vaccination increased worldwide from 20% in 1982(?) to 80% in 1990 because of the child survival revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Black, Children First: The Story of UNICEF, Past and Present (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 33; see also UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 1986 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1990, [[Donald Henderson|D. A. Henderson]] noted that although "dramatic progress" had been made because of the child survival revolution, the results were still "little-appreciated".&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

The child survival revolution is estimated to have saved the lives of 25 million children.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|59}}

==Focus areas==
The genesis of the Child Survival Revolution can be traced to 1973 when [[James P. Grant]], gave his annual lecture at Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health. In reviewing research findings of Prof [[Carl E. Taylor]] Grant grasped how the collective package from Taylor's Narangwal research (childhood pneumonia, oral rehydration therapy, neonatal tetanus, family planning) served as a parallel to The Green Revolution, saying "we can now start to talk about a Child Survival Revolution!" &lt;ref&gt; Daniel C. Taylor and Carl E. Taylor (2016), Just and Lasting Change: When Communities Own Their Futures 2nd Edition (New York: Johns Hopkins University Press, p176-177)&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant had earlier been Deputy Director of USAID, and in that role had been an early and strong backer of [[The Green Revolution]], a global effort that dramatically raised global food supply through a package of agricultural innovations (new seed types, fertilizer, irrigation, pesticides, and mechanization). Grant grasped that it was the synergy that came through a package of interventions that would allow children to survive,

For much of the child survival revolution, James Grant and UNICEF adopted a strategy known as [[GOBI-FFF]], a form of selective primary healthcare:&lt;ref&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=G for growth monitoring to detect undernutrition in small children, O for [[oral rehydration therapy]] [ORT] to treat childhood diarrhea, B to encourage breastfeeding (which had declined precipitously due to working mothers and the marketing of infant formula), and I for immunization against the six basic childhood diseases: tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles. (They added two Fs: food supplements and family planning; and, later, a third: female education.)}}

Of these, "immunization and ORT were seen as the 'twin-engines' of the child survival revolution".&lt;ref name=gautam/&gt;&lt;ref name="jim_grant_book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Jim Grant: UNICEF Visionary |author1=Peter Adamson |author2=Carol Bellamy |author3=Kul Gautam |author4=Richard Jolly |author5=Nyi Nyi |author6=Mary Racelis |author7=Richard Reid |author8=Jon Rohde |year=2001 |url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_4402.html |publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}

After 1986, when studies by [[Alfred Sommer]] and others were published, [[vitamin A]] administration also became a focus.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

==Organizations involved==
Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations were involved.

* [[Rockefeller Foundation]]&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt;
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)
* [[World Bank]]
* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)
* [[Rotary International]] pledged to raise $120 million.&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Child Survival Revolution |author=[[D. A. Henderson]] |year=1990 |journal=Pediatric Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of mass media==
UNICEF took advantage of the growing levels of basic education and access to television and radio to generate support for the child survival revolution through persuasion.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt;

James Grant also "persuaded many heads of state to get personally involved in their national programmes for children, for example in their immunization by being photographed giving polio drops to a baby". Several figures from film and sports, like [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Liv Ullmann]], and [[Peter Ustinov]] also participated in the [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador program]].&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|62}}

[[File:Conflict minerals 961w.jpg|thumb|Four common conflict minerals, clockwise from top left: [[coltan]], [[cassiterite]], [[gold]] ore, and [[wolframite]].]]
'''Conflict resources''' are [[natural resource]]s extracted in a [[conflict zone]] and sold to perpetuate the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;p.8, Conflict and Development: Peacebuilding and Post-conflict Resolution; Sixth Report of Session 2005–06, Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: International Development Committee, The Stationery Office, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There is both statistical and anecdotal evidence that belligerent accessibility to precious commodities can prolong conflicts (a "[[Resource curse#Conflict|resource curse]]").&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Le Billon, "Fuelling War: Natural Resources and Armed Conflicts", Adelphi Paper 373, IISS &amp; Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ross,"How Do Natural Resources Influence Civil War? Evidence from Thirteen Cases", International Organization, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Fearon and David lotinakin "Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War" [[American Political Science Review]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent contemporary example has been the eastern provinces of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), where various armies, rebel groups, and outside actors have profited from mining while contributing to violence and exploitation during wars in the region.

The four most commonly mined '''conflict minerals''' (known as 3TGs, from their initials)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assentcompliance.com/conflict-minerals-consulting-services/|title=Assent Compliance|author=|date=|website=Assent Compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[cassiterite]] (for [[tin]]), [[wolframite]] (for [[tungsten]]), [[coltan]] (for [[tantalum]]), and [[gold]] ore, which are extracted from the eastern Congo, and passed through a variety of intermediaries before being purchased. These minerals are essential in the manufacture of a variety of devices, including [[consumer electronics]] such as mobile phones, laptops, and MP3 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Dias |date=July 24, 2009 |title=First Blood Diamonds, Now Blood Computers? |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912594,00.html |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1B1lxV6?url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1912594%2C00.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraction and sale of [[blood diamond]]s, also known as "conflict diamonds", is a better-known phenomenon which occurs under virtually identical conditions. Even [[petroleum]] can be a conflict resource; [[Oil production and smuggling in ISIL|ISIS used oil revenue]] to finance its military and terrorist activities.

International efforts to reduce trade in conflict resources, tried to reduce incentives to extract and fight over them. For example, in the United States, the 2010 [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 1502, known as the "Conflict Mineral Law", to be enforced by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; required manufacturers to audit their [[supply chain]]s and report use of conflict minerals.  In 2015 a US [[United States court of appeals|federal appeals court]] struck down some aspects of the reporting requirements as a violation of [[Corporate personhood|corporations’ freedom of speech]], but left others in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43639.pdf |title=Conflict Minerals and Resource Extraction: Dodd-Frank, SEC Regulations, and Legal Challenges |author=Michael V. Seitzinger |author2=Kathleen Ann Ruane |publisher=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=May 1, 2016 | date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept of 'conflict resource', or 'conflict [[commodity]]' emerged in the late 1990s, initially in relation to the '[[conflict diamonds]]' that were financing rebellions in Angola and [[Sierra Leone]]. (The media often called these '[[blood diamonds]]'.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the face of enormous suffering caused by the diamond-fuelled wars in Sierra Leone, Angola and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], we have a duty to ensure that we are doing as much as we can
|accessdate=2010-06-05 |date= 2000-06-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then 'conflict timber' financed hostilities in Cambodia and [[Liberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/liberian-conflict-timber-faces-trade-ban

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conventions ===
The concept was first officially discussed by the [[UN General Assembly]] in the context of 'conflict diamonds':&lt;ref&gt;[http://mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca/kimberleyprocess/UN_Resolution_e.pdf UNGA Resolution 55/56 (2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108001135/http://mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca/kimberleyprocess/UN_resolution_e.pdf |date=2006-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UN Security Council]] has since referred to conflict resources in several resolutions.{{which|date=May 2016}}

[[Global Witness]] has called for an international standardized definition to facilitate a more systematic application of UN resolutions, the prevention of complicity in abuses during hostilities by commercial entities exploiting or trading in conflict resources, and the prosecution of [[war profiteer]]s suspected of supporting or abetting war criminals.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010161842/http://www.humansecuritybulletin.info/page434.htm]"

== Conflict minerals ==

The four most prominent conflict minerals, for example codified in the U.S. Conflict Minerals Law, are:

*'''Columbite-tantalite''' (or ''[[coltan]]'', the colloquial African term) is the metal ore from which the element [[tantalum]] is extracted.  Tantalum is used primarily for the production of [[tantalum capacitor]]s, particularly for applications requiring high performance, a small compact format and high reliability, from [[hearing aid]]s and [[pacemaker]]s, to [[airbag]]s, [[GPS]], ignition systems and anti-lock braking systems in automobiles, through to laptop computers, mobile phones, video game consoles, video cameras and digital cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tantalum – Raw Materials and Processing |url=http://tanb.org/tantalum |publisher=Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1BooEpq?url=http://tanb.org/tantalum |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its carbide form, tantalum possesses significant hardness and wear resistance properties. As a result, it is used in jet engine/turbine blades, drill bits, end mills and other tools.
*'''Cassiterite''' is the chief ore needed to produce [[tin]], essential for the production of tin cans and the [[solder]] on the circuit boards of electronic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tin |url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/phototin.html |publisher=Mineral Information Institute |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1C3xwLJ?url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/phototin.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin is also commonly a component of biocides, fungicides and as tetrabutyl tin/tetraoctyl tin, an intermediate in [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) and high performance paint manufacturing.
*'''[[Wolframite]]''' is an important source of the element [[tungsten]]. Tungsten is a very dense metal and is frequently used for this property, such as in fishing weights, dart tips and golf club heads. Like [[tantalum carbide]], [[tungsten carbide]] possesses hardness and wear resistance properties and is frequently used in applications like metalworking tools, drill bits and milling. Smaller amounts are used to substitute lead in "green ammunition".&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tungsten |first=Kim B. |last=Shedd |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/680400.pdf |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |year=2000 |accessdate=June 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1CK1wyQ?url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/680400.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimal amounts are used in electronic devices, including the vibration mechanism of cell phones.
*'''Gold''' is used in jewelry, electronics, and dental products. It is also present in some chemical compounds used in certain semiconductor manufacturing processes.

These are sometimes referred to as "''the 3T's and gold''", ''3TG'', or even simply the "''3T's''".  Under the US Conflict Minerals Law, additional minerals may be added to this list in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010-26.htm |title=Remarks on not adding niobium to the list |publisher=Sec.gov |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed conflict and mineral resource looting by the [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese National Army]] and various armed rebel groups, including the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR) and the [[National Congress for the Defense of the People]] (CNDP), a proxy Rwandan militia group, has occurred throughout the late 20th century and the early 21st century. Additionally, the looting of the Congo's natural resources is not limited to domestic actors. During the Congo Wars ([[First Congo War]] (1996–1997) and [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2003)), Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi particularly profited from the Congo's resources. These governments continued to smuggle resources out of the Congo to this day.{{Citation needed|reason=likely true, but a serious charge that requires proof|date=May 2016}}

The profits from the sale of these minerals have financed fighting in the Second Congo War and ongoing follow-on conflicts. Control of lucrative mines has also itself become a military objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Witness Report: 'Faced with a gun, what can you do?' |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/report_en_final_0.pdf |publisher=[[Global Witness]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1AhKWsY?url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/report_en_final_0.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mines ===
Mines, in eastern Congo, are often located far from populated areas in remote and dangerous regions. A recent study by International Peace Information Service (IPIS) indicates that armed groups are present at more than 50% of mining sites. At many sites, armed groups illegally tax, extort, and coerce civilians to work.  Miners, including children, work up to 48-hour shifts amidst mudslides and tunnel collapses that kill many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Congo's Riches, Looted by Renegade Troops |first = Lydia |last = Polgreen |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/africa/16congo.html?&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] |date = November 15, 2008 |accessdate = December 16, 2010 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5v1BQBTW8?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/africa/16congo.html?_r=1&amp;&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate = December 16, 2010 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups are often affiliated with rebel groups, or with the Congolese National Army, but both use rape and violence to control the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape Crisis in East Congo Tied to Mining Activity |first=Dominique |last=Soguel |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/090601/rape-crisis-in-east-congo-tied-mining-activity |work=[[Women's eNews]] |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1Bd15JZ?url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/090601/rape-crisis-in-east-congo-tied-mining-activity |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States law ==
In April 2009, Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) introduced the Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009 (S. 891)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/891|title=S.891 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009|first=Brownback,|last=Sam|date=23 April 2009|website=www.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; to require electronics companies to verify and disclose their sources of cassiterite, wolframite, and tantalum. This legislation died in committee. However, Brownback added similar language as Section 1502 of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], which passed Congress and was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on July 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.steptoe.com/publications-7050.html New Corporate Social Responsibility Mandate Related to Conflict Materials in the New Financial Reform Bill Could Affect Many Companies]" (July 20, 2010). Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) draft regulations to implement the Conflict Mineral Law, published in the [[Federal Register]] of December 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80948 – 80975&lt;/ref&gt; would have required U.S. and certain foreign companies to report and make public their use of so-called "conflict minerals" from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries in their products. Comments on this proposal were extended until March 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2011/34-63793.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The comments on the proposal were reviewable by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010.shtml |title=Comments on File No. s7-40-10 |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One report on the proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/sec-provides-preview-of-april-15-final-rules-on-conflict-minerals-supply-chain-traceability/ |title=SEC Provides Preview of April 15 Final Rules on Conflict Minerals Supply Chain Traceability &amp;#124; Your EHS Connection |publisher=Elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com |date=March 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated the following statistics for the submitted comments:
* Slightly more than 700 comment letters were submitted to SEC on the proposal;
* Approximately 65% of those were form letters or basic letters from the general public supporting the rule's intent;
* The remaining 35% (roughly 270) represent views of businesses, trade/industry associations, the investment/financial community, professional auditing firms, and other relevant governmental entities; and
* Of those 270 comments, an estimated 200 contained substantive and/or technical comments.
That report also contained what it calls a "preview of the final SEC regulations" synthesized from their detailed research and analysis of a large body of documents, reports and other information on the law, proposed regulation and the current budget/political setting facing the SEC in the current administration.

The final rule went into effect 13 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC rule did not go unnoticed by the international community, including entities seeking to undermine traceability efforts.  A report published by a metals trading publication illustrated one DRC ore/mineral flow method that has apparently been devised to thwart detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agmetalminer.com/2011/02/24/loophole-in-conflict-minerals-law-creates-opportunity-for-scrap-dealers/ |title=Loophole in Conflict Minerals Law Creates Opportunity for Scrap Dealers |publisher=Agmetalminer.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2011, the US State Department issued a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eeb/diamonds/docs/168632.htm |title=Statement Concerning Implementation of Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Legislation Concerning Conflict Minerals Due Diligence |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject.  Section 1502(c) of the Law mandates that the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] work in conjunction with SEC on certain elements of conflict minerals policy development and support.

On October 23, 2012 U.S. State Dept Officials asserted that ultimately, it falls on the U.S. State Dept. to determine when this rule would no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Dept of State &amp; Intelleges Webinar |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8H947wuCNI|publisher=Intelleges|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down several parts of the SEC Rules as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/14/us-court-sec-conflictminerals-idUSBREA3D13U20140414|title=U.S. appeals court finds conflict-minerals rule violates free speech|first=Sarah N.|last=Lynch|date=|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditing and reporting requirements ===
US Conflict Minerals Law contains two requirements that are closely connected: 
*independent third party supply chain traceability audits
* reporting of audit information to the public and SEC.

Even companies not directly regulated by the SEC will be impacted by the audit requirements because they will be pushed down through entire supply chains, including privately held and foreign-owned companies.

SEC estimated that 1,199 "issuers" (i.e., companies subject to filing other SEC reports) will be required to submit full conflict mineral reports.  This estimate was developed by finding the amount of tantalum produced by the DRC in comparison to global production (15% – 20%).  The Commission selected the higher figure of 20% and multiplied that by 6,000 (the total number of "issuers" SEC will be required to do initial product/process evaluations).&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg 80966&lt;/ref&gt;  This estimate does not account for the companies who supply materials to the "issuers" (but are not themselves SEC-regulated) but who will almost certainly be required to conduct conflict minerals audits to meet the demands of those customers.  Other estimates indicate that the total number of US companies likely impacted may exceed 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agmetalminer.com/2011/02/25/conflict-minerals-law-supply-chain-due-diligence-and-impact-on-metal-buying-organizations-part-three/ |title=Conflict Minerals Law, Supply Chain Due Diligence and Impact on Metal Buying Organizations – Part Three |publisher=Agmetalminer.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the potential impact of the regulation in early 2011 by the ''[[IPC (electronics)|IPC – Association Connecting Electronic Industries]]'' trade association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipc.org/ |title=Association Connecting Electronics Industries |publisher=IPC |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was submitted with the association's comments to the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipc.org/3.0_Industry/3.3_Gov_Relations/2011/IPC-SEC-NPRM-Comments-030311.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The study states that the IPC survey respondents had a median of 163 direct suppliers.  Applying that number to the SEC's estimated number of impacted issuers results in the possibility of over 195,000 businesses that could be subject to some level of supply chain traceability effort.

==== Applicability in general ====
Under the law, companies have to submit an annual conflict minerals report to the SEC if: 
*(a) they are required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act of 1934 
*(b) conflict minerals are ''necessary to the functionality or production of a product that they manufacture or contract to be manufactured.'' That statement contains two separate – but critical concepts: the purpose of the conflict mineral in the product/process, and the control that the company exerts over the manufacturing process/specifications.

A company would be deemed to contract an item to be manufactured if it:
*Exerts any influence over the manufacturing process; or,
*Offers a generic product under its own brand name or a separate brand name (regardless of whether the company has any influence over the manufacturing process) and the company contracted to have the product manufactured specifically for itself.

This language implied that some retailers who are not manufacturers might be subject to the audit and disclosure requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sandler, Travis  |author2=Rosenberg, P.A. |title=Client Advisory: Retailers May Be Subject to Proposed SEC Conflict Mineral Reporting Requirements |date=December 23, 2010 |accessdate=May 1, 2016|url=http://www.strtrade.com/advisory.aspx?id=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Contracting to manufacture" a product requires some actual influence over the manufacturing of process that product, a determination based on facts and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Adopts Rule for Disclosing Use of Conflict Minerals|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-163.htm|publisher=SEC|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company is not to be deemed to have influence over the manufacturing process if it merely:
* Affixes its brand, marks, logo, or label to a generic product manufactured by a third party.
* Services, maintains, or repairs a product manufactured by a third party.
* Specifies or negotiates contractual terms with a manufacturer that do not directly relate to the manufacturing of the product.

The proposed regulations attempted to clarify that tools used in assembly and manufacturing will not trigger the law.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80953&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent was to cover minerals/metals in the final product only. Nothing specifically addresses intermediate chemical processes that use chemicals that contain conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, some electronic components use chemical solutions containing gold at some point in the manufacturing processes.  Tin is used during the chemical processes for manufacturing PVC and certain high performance paints/coatings.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, neither the law nor the proposed regulation established a [[de minimis]] quantity or other form of materiality threshold that would preclude the applicability of the auditing/reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80963&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Supply chain traceability auditing ====

The law mandates the use of an "independent private sector auditor" to conduct the audits. SEC has proposed two different standards for the audits: the "reasonable inquiry" and the "[[due diligence]]".&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80956&lt;/ref&gt;  Should the final rule include this structure, the reasonable inquiry would be the first step to determine if the company can on its own, using reasonable efforts and trustworthy information, make a reliable determination as to the source/origin of its tin, tantalum, tungsten and/or gold.  Where companies are unable to make such a determination for any reason, they would then be required to take the next step of the "due diligence", which is the independent private sector audit.

The statute specified that the audits be "conducted in accordance with standards established by the [[Comptroller General of the United States]], in accordance with rules promulgated by the Commission." This means that the same auditing standards that apply to other SEC auditing requirements will apply to conflict minerals audits &lt;ref name="Section 1502b"&gt;Section 1502(b).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this language, SEC will have little discretion to allow companies to issue self-generated statements or certifications to satisfy the law.

Third party audits for conflict minerals supply chain traceability began in summer 2010 under the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), a US-based electronics manufacturing trade association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eicc.info/PDF/PR%20Extractives%20Smelter%20Audit%20Launch%20FINAL.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102203237/http://www.eicc.info/PDF/PR%20Extractives%20Smelter%20Audit%20Launch%20FINAL.pdf |date=November 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this program, EICC selected three audit firms to conduct the actual audits, with two of the three participating in the pilot audits in 2010. After concluding the pilot, one of the two firms involved in 2010 withdrew from the program specifically in response to the SEC's proposal and to reduce potential legal risks to the audited entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdcexec.com/web/online/Global-Focus-News/Conflict-Minerals-Sustainability-and-Audit-Services-to-Align-with-US-SEC-Audit-Standards/50$13230 |title=Find It: |publisher=Sdcexec.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the law nor the proposed regulations provide guidance on what will be considered an acceptable audit scope or process, preferring to allow companies the flexibility meeting the requirement in a manner that is responsive to their own individual business and supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80957&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the law contains a provision that preserves the government's rights to deem any report, audit or other due diligence processes as being unreliable, and in such cases, the report shall not satisfy the requirements of the regulations,&lt;ref&gt;Section 1502(b)&lt;/ref&gt; further emphasizing the need for such audits to conform to established SEC auditing standards. Comments on the proposed regulation pointed out that, should SEC not specify an applicable audit standard, it cannot also be silent or ambiguous on the auditor standards as well, or the Commission will violate the plain language of the Law mandating "standards established by the Comptroller General of the United States".&lt;ref name="sec.gov"&gt;See numerous comments filed at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally expected that SEC will provide specificity on both the audit standard and the auditor standard.  SEC's proposal attempted to clarify its position on auditor requirements.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80958&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/home/0,3675,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |doi=10.1787/factbook-2010-en |publisher=Oecd.org |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; published its Guidance on conflict minerals supply chain traceability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/36/0,3746,en_2649_34889_44307940_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This guidance is gaining much momentum as "the" standard within US policy.  However, a recent critical analysis of the standard in comparison to existing US auditing standards under SEC highlighted a number of significant inconsistencies and conflict with relevant US standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/oecd-to-sec-make-us-the-conflict-minerals-due-diligenceaudit-standard-for-the-us/ |title=OECD to SEC: Make us the Conflict Minerals Due Diligence/Audit Standard for the US &amp;#124; Your EHS Connection |publisher=Elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies subject to the US law who implement the OECD Guidance without regard for the SEC auditing standards may face legal compliance risks.

==== Reporting and disclosure ====
Companies subject to the SEC reporting requirement would be required to disclose whether the minerals used in their products originated in the DRC or adjoining countries (as defined above). The law mandates that this reporting be submitted/made available annually. Many comments to the proposed regulation asked SEC to clarify whether the report must be "furnished"—meaning it is made available to SEC but not directly incorporated within the company's formal financial report—or "submitted"—meaning the report is directly incorporated into the financial report.&lt;ref name="sec.gov" /&gt;  At first glance, this may appear to be a minor point; however, this difference is very important in determining the audit/auditor standards and related liabilities.

If it is determined that none of the minerals originated in the DRC or adjoining countries, the report must include a statement to that effect and provide an explanation of the country of origin analysis that was used to arrive at the ultimate conclusion. On the other hand, if conflict minerals originating in the DRC or adjoining countries were used (or if it is not possible to determine the country of origin of the conflict minerals used), companies would be required to state as such in the annual report. In either case, companies would also be required to make this information public by posting their annual conflict minerals report on their websites, and providing the SEC with the internet addresses where the reports may be found. Further, the proposed regulations would require companies to maintain records relating to the country of origin of conflict minerals used in their products.

Media outlets have reported that many companies required to file Specialized Disclosure Reports to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and any necessary conflict minerals reports for 2013 under the SEC’s conflict minerals rule are struggling to meet the June 2, 2014 report filing deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hills|first=Mark E.|title=Deadline Looms for Conflict Mineral Disclosure Requirements: Update for Suppliers of Reporting Companies|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/deadline-looms-conflict-mineral-disclosure-requirements-update-suppliers-reporting-c|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=16 May 2014|author2=Jacob A.

=== Criticism of the law ===
The law has been criticised for not addressing the root causes of the conflict, leaving to the Congolese government the responsibility for providing an environment in which companies can practice due diligence and legitimately purchase the minerals they need, when the reality is that mechanisms for transparency do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.undispatch.com/digging-deeper-into-the-dodd-frank-congo-blood-minerals-controversy | accessdate=Oct 17, 2011 | title=Digging Deeper Into the Dodd-Frank Congo ‘Blood Minerals’ Controversy | date=Aug 9, 2011 | work=UN Dispatch }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect has been to halt legitimate mining ventures that provided livelihoods for people, reducing the Congo's legal exports of tantalum by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/a-rule-aimed-at-warlords-upends-african-mines-08042011.html | accessdate=Oct 17, 2011 | title=A Rule Aimed at Warlords Upends African Mines | date=Aug 4, 2011 | work=Bloomberg Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) found that most companies were unable to determine the source of their conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/672051.pdf ''SEC CONFLICT MINERALS RULE: Initial Disclosures Indicate Most Companies Were Unable to Determine the Source of Their Conflict Minerals''], GAO-15-561: Published: Aug 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed law in Europe ==
The European Parliament passed legislation in 2015; negotiations are currently underway among member states as to specific wording details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20150513IPR55318/Conflict-minerals-MEPs-ask-for-mandatory-certification-of-EU-importers |title=Conflict minerals: MEPs ask for mandatory certification of EU importers |date=May 20, 2015 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |author=European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2016 the European Parliament confirmed that "mandatory due diligence" would be required for "all but the smallest EU firms importing tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold and their ores".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160615IPR32320/Conflict-minerals-MEPs-secure-mandatory-due-diligence-for-importers Conflict minerals: MEPs secure mandatory due diligence for importers], Press Release issued 16 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2017 the EU passed Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the Parliament and of the Council on the supply chain due diligence obligations for importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten, their ores, and gold from conflict-affected and high risk areas. The regulation will take effect in January 2021, and will directly apply to companies that import 3TG metals into the EU, no matter where they originate.&lt;ref&gt;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32017R0821&amp;qid=1542740800246 Content is copied from this source, which is (c) European Union, 1995-2018.

== Conflict resources in supply chains ==
Increases in business process outsourcing to globally dispersed production facilities means that social problems and human rights violations are no longer only an organization matter, but also often occur in companies’ supply chains, and challenge for supply chain managers.&lt;ref name="SCDD"&gt;Hannes Hofmann, Martin C. Schleper, Constantin Blome: ''Conflict Minerals and Supply Chain Due Diligence: An Exploratory Study of Multitier Supply Chains.'' In: ''Journal of Business Ethics.'' DOI 10.1007/s10551-015-2963-z&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the harm conflict minerals do where they are produced, human rights violations also raise an enormous risk to corporate reputations. Consumers, mass media and employees expect companies to behave responsibly and have become intolerant of those who don't.

Consequently, firms that are located downstream in the supply chain and that are more visible to stakeholders are particularly threatened by social supply chain problems. The recent debate concerning conflict minerals illustrates the importance of social and human rights issues in supply chain management practice as well as the emerging need to react to social conflicts. Conflict minerals are processed in many different components throughout various industries and hence have a high overall impact on business.
 
Initiatives like the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] or the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas&lt;ref name ="OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/GuidanceEdition2.pdf OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas]&lt;/ref&gt; demand that supply chain managers verify purchased goods as ‘‘conflict-free’’ or implement measures to better manage any inability to do so.

Minerals mined in Eastern Congo pass through the hands of numerous middlemen as they are shipped out of Congo, through neighboring countries such as [[Rwanda]] or [[Burundi]], to East Asian processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR-CONGO: Firms Fuelling 'Conflict Minerals' Violence, Report Says |first=Marina |last=Litvinsky |url=http://www.ips.org/africa/2009/07/dr-congo-firms-fuelling-conflict-minerals-violence-report-says/ |agency=[[Inter Press Service]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1CoG37B?url=http://www.ips.org/africa/2009/07/dr-congo-firms-fuelling-conflict-minerals-violence-report-says/ |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, the US Conflict Minerals Law applies to materials originating (or claimed to originate) from the DRC as well as the nine adjoining countries: [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Congo Republic]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zambia]].

Firms have begun to apply governance mechanisms to avoid adverse effects of conflict mineral sourcing. However, the mere transfer of responsibilities upstream in the supply chain apparently will not stop the trade with conflict minerals, notably due to two reasons: 
*On the one hand, globalization has created governance gaps in a sense that companies are able to abuse human rights without being sanctioned by independent third parties. This gap results in a non-allocation of responsibility that makes the problem of human rights abuses and social conflicts within dispersed supply chains very likely to endure, particularly without collaborative approaches to remedy these deficiencies. 
*On the other hand, conflict minerals usually originate from globally diverse deposits and are difficult to track within components and manufactured products. This is the case because they are mixed with minerals of different origin and added to metal alloys.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt; Consequently, although the share of these minerals in single end products may be negligible, they are prevalent in numerous products and commodities. Together, these circumstances leave downstream firms nearly incapable of detecting risks associated with conflict minerals. Hence, the topic of conflict minerals becomes one of supply chain management rather than of individual companies’ legal or compliance divisions alone. What is needed is effective and supply-chain wide-mechanisms of traceability and due diligence that allow firms to take individual and collective responsibility as parts of supply chains.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt;

In the context of mineral supply chains, due diligence represents a holistic concept that aims at providing a chain of custody tracking from mine to export at country level, regional tracking of mineral flows through the creation of a database on their purchases, independent audits on all actors in the supply chain, and a monitoring of the whole mineral chain by a mineral chain auditor. In this sense, due diligence transcends conventional risk management approaches that usually focus on the prevention of direct impacts on the core business activities of companies. Moreover, due diligence focuses on a maximum of transparency as an end itself while risk management is always directed towards the end of averting direct damages. However, besides the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] and the OECD Guidance, there is still a gap in due diligence practices as international norms are just emerging. Studies found that the motivation for supply chain due diligence as well as expected outcomes of these processes vary among firms.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt; Furthermore, different barriers, drivers, and implementation patterns of supply chain due diligence have been identified in scholarly research.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt;

Moreover, [[FairPhone]] Foundation raises awareness of conflict minerals in the mobile industry and is a company which tries to produce a smart phone with 'fair' conditions along the supply chain. Various industry and trade associations are also monitoring developments in conflict minerals laws and traceability frameworks.  Some of these represent electronics, retailers, jewelry, mining, electronics components, and general manufacturing sectors.  One organization – ITRI (a UK-based international non-profit organization  representing the tin industry and sponsored/supported by its members, principally miners and smelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itri.co.uk/bfora/systems/xmlviewer/default.asp?arg=DS_ITRI_ABOUTART_16/_firsttitle.xsl/4 |title=Tin Markets, Technology and Sustainability |publisher=ITRI |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) had spearheaded efforts for the development and implementation of a "bag and tag" scheme at the mine as a key element of credible traceability.&lt;ref&gt;An overview and timeline of ITRI's activities on conflict minerals can be seen here – {{cite web |url=http://www.itri.co.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_PARTART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_PARTART_310250 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206154403/http://www.itri.co.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_PARTART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_PARTART_310250 |archivedate=2010-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program and related efforts were initially not likely to extend beyond the pilot phase due to a variety of implementation and funding problems that occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itri.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_322557 |title=Tin Markets, Technology and Sustainability |publisher=ITRI |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end however, the device did enter the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairphone.com/#roadmap|title=Fairphone|author=|date=|website=Fairphone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2011, the UK government launched an informational section on its Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office website dedicated to conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foreign Office launches conflict minerals information for businesses |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=575312582 |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929120441/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=575312582 |archivedate=September 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information resource is intended to assist British companies in understanding the issues and, specifically, the US requirements.

On Jan 6th 2014, the semiconductor giant Intel announced that it would distance itself from conflict minerals. As a result, all Intel microprocessors henceforth will be conflict-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Ariel|title=Starting Now, All Intel Microprocessors Are Conflict-Free: Here's How The Company Did It|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3024292/starting-now-all-intel-microprocessors-are-conflict-free-heres-how-the-company-did-it|work=Co.Exist|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial reporting solutions ==

Manufacturers and supply chain partners needing to comply with the ever-increasing reporting regulations have a few commercial options available.

A major research report from November 2012 by the Southern Africa Resource Watch revealed that gold miners in the east of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] were being exploited by corrupt government officials, bureaucrats and security personnel, who all demand illegal tax, fees and levies from the miners without delivering any services in return. Despite the alleged gold rush in regions of the country, none of the population and workforce is benefiting from this highly lucrative industry.&lt;ref name="ALL" /&gt;

'''Cristina Possas de Albuquerque''' (born 5 June 1948) is a [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] and [[emerging infectious disease]]s from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, N., "Epidemiology and the web of causation: has anyone seen the spider?" Social Science and Medicine 1994; 39:887–903&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KriegerNancy"&gt;Krieger, Nancy (2011). Epidemiology and the People's Health : Theory and Context. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199750351}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, her approach to social ecosystem complexity is quite different from the four-fold eco-social approach of Harvard's Nancy Krieger in that she has proposed in a 2001 English-language article in the ''Brazilian Journal of Public Health Reports'' the concept of "social ecosystem health" where ecosystems are increasingly changed by social human activity, favoring the emergence of diseases, so the term "social" should precede the prefix "eco".&lt;ref&gt;Possas, C. 2001. Social ecosystem health: confronting the complexity and emergence of infectious diseases. Cadernos de Saúde Pública (Brazilian Journal pf Public Health Reports) 17.1: 30-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Possas, C. 2001 Debate on the paper by David Waltner-Toews. Cadernos de Saúde Pública (''Brazilian Journal pf Public Health Reports''), 17, S27-S28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Levins, R. and Lopez C. "Toward an ecosocial view of health", ''International Journal of Health Services'' 29(2):261-293, 1999.  Her mentor and former colleague, Dr. [[Richard Levins]], had used the phrase "ecosocial view of health."&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, she is known for (a) developing her new conceptual approach to [[social epidemiology]], incorporating the economic concept of structural heterogeneity into an epidemiological model to identify the epidemiological profiles of heterogeneous populations in different social and economic strata and the conditions for emergence of diseases; (b) contributions of health policy and health reform in Brazil; and research on health transition, ecological change, complex systems, and emergence of new diseases.

She is a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University in Boston,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/fellowships/takemi-fellowship-program/ Takemi Program], [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://ems.sph.harvard.edu/MasterCalendar/EventDetails.aspx?data=hHr80o3M7J5dSU1l%2F%2FAreV7Jd9fcjcVoCH%2BPlrX4uXxoT57ypPvhl%2BVQWaGVjPQ0 Cristina Possas: Zika and Dengue in Brazil: ecological, social, and anthropological perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt; where for 10 years she has been a Visiting Scientist and a [[Fulbright Fellowship|Fulbright Fellow]], and a professor at [[FIOCRUZ]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigass.fiocruz.br/pub/programa/docente/espelho.do?codDados=37252 FIOCRUZ Faculty profile for Cristina de Albuquerque Possas, PhD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308061641/http://www.sigass.fiocruz.br/pub/programa/docente/espelho.do?codDados=37252 |date=2016-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Brazilian Brazilian [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cristina Possas de Albuquerque (Cristina Possas) has as a policymaker long worked closely with public health and environmental scientists and with human rights and social justice civil organizations.

She also is a full professor at [[FIOCRUZ]] in Brazil, where in 1998 she had earned a PhD in [[public health]], and where she now does research on infectious diseases and teaches a course named "Scientific Methodology" in the Masters and Doctoral Programs.

She has been also a Professor of Health Policy at the National School of Public Health at the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], Brazil.  She was nominated in 1987 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health/Fiocruz to be the National Technical Coordinator of seven Groups supporting the Health Reform in Brazil, whose contributions were later incorporated into the new Brazilian 1988 Constitution.

For a decade, she also has been a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University, a Visiting Scientist and [[Fulbright Fellowship|Fulbright Fellow]], and a member of the Harvard New Diseases Group, coordinated by the late [[Richard Levins]] and by [[Tamara Awerbuch-Friedlander]], collaborating with them and other outstanding members of the group in the organizing committee of the Woods Hole Conference on New Diseases, with articles with the group later published in a special supplement of the ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' on this conference and in other journals. She had held for 10 years a national position as the Head of the Research and Development Unit of the Brazilian National AIDS Program.

She has worked for more than five decades in several national and international positions with the scientific community and civil society organizations.  For ten years, she had been National Director of the Research and Technological Development Unit at the Brazilian [[AIDS]] Program in the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which has been recognized globally as an outstanding public health initiative with innovative approaches to the pandemics, always centering on free and universal access to prevention and treatment.  She was invited by the Director of the National AIDS Program to conceive and create a new and innovative Research and Technological Development Unit in the Program’s structure.

She has given interviews on [[AIDS]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqG-W1Xyoac Entrevista, Dr. Cristina Possas discusses AIDS, Dec 16, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[dengue fever|dengue]], and [[zika fever|zika]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Democracy}}Criticism of [[democracy]] is grounded in democracy's contested definition—its purpose, process, and outcomes. Since [[Classical antiquity]] and through the modern era, democracy has been associated with "rule of the people," "rule of the majority," and free selection or election either through direct participation or elected representation respectively, but has not been linked to a particular outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy|title=Democracy – Definition of Democracy by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political thinkers approach their critique of democracy from different perspectives. Many do not necessarily oppose democracy—"rule of the people"—but, rather, seek to expand or question its popular definition. In their work, they distinguish between democratic principles that are effectively implemented through undemocratic procedures; undemocratic principles that are implemented through democratic procedures; and variations of the same kind.

For instance, some critics of democracy would agree with [[Winston Churchill]]'s famous remark, "No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206|title=Parliament Bill|last=|first=|date=11 November 1947|website=api.parliament.uk|language=English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While others, may be more prepared to describe existing democratic regimes as anything but "rule of the people."

Critics of democracy have tried to highlight democracy's inconsistencies, paradoxes, and limits by contrasting it with other forms of governments. They have characterized most modern democracies as democratic [[Polyarchy|polyarchies]]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition|last=Dahl|first=Robert A.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1972|isbn=0300015658|location=New Haven|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and democratic [[Aristocracy|aristocracies]];&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Principles of Representative Government|last=Manin|first=Bernard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0521458919|location=Cambridge|pages=2, 67–93, 132–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have identified [[Fascism|fascist]] moments in modern democracies; they have termed the societies produced by modern democracies as [[Neo-feudalism|neo-feudal]];&lt;ref&gt;Thom Hartmann, "[http://www.commondreams.org/views/2002/11/06/time-remove-bananas-and-return-our-republic-democracy Time to Remove the Bananas...and Return Our Republic to Democracy]", ''CommonDreams.org'', 6 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while, yet others, have contrasted democracy with [[Nazism]], [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[theocracy]], and [[absolute monarchy]].

The most widely known critics of democracy include [[Plato]] and [[The Federalist Papers|the authors of the Federalist Papers]], who were interested in establishing a [[representative democracy]] in America instead of a [[direct democracy]].

Additional historical figures associated with the critique of democracy thought include [[Aristotle]], [[Montesquieu]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hubert Lagardelle]], [[Charles Maurras]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]], and [[Elazar Menachem Shach]].

Leading contemporary thinkers in critical democratic theory include [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Robert A. Dahl]], [[Robert E. Goodin]], [[Bernard Manin]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[James S. Fishkin]], [[Ian Shapiro]], [[Jason Brennan]], [[Hélène Landemore]] and [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]].

==Criticism of democracy's purpose==

===Benefits of a specialized society===
One such argument is that the benefits of a specialized society may be compromised by democracy. As ordinary citizens are encouraged to take part in the political life of the country, they have the power to directly influence the outcome of government policies through the democratic procedures of voting, campaigning and the use of press. The result is that government policies may be more influenced by non-specialist opinions and thereby the effectiveness compromised, especially if a policy is very technically sophisticated and/or the general public inadequately informed. For example, there is no guarantee that those who campaign about the government's economic policies are themselves professional economists or academically competent in this particular discipline, regardless of whether they were well-educated. Essentially this means that a democratic government may not be providing the most good for the largest number of people. However, some have argued that this should not even be the goal of democracies because the minority could be seriously mistreated under that purported goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kenneth J. |last1=Arrow |first2=Robert C. |last2=Lind |date=June 1970  |title=Uncertainty and the Evaluation of Public Investment Decisions|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=364–378 |id= |jstor=1817987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule of the aristocratic ===

====Nietzsche====

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], as an opponent of [[Christianity]], saw western democracy as connected to it, claiming that "the ''democratic'' movement is Christianity's heir" and denounced the democratic man for being inherently unable to "feel any shame for being unable to rise above" his desire "to satisfy a host of petty wants through the calculation of long-term self-interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/nietzsche-friedrich_inevitability-of-democracy-1886.htm|title=Friedrich Nietzsche / The Inevitabilty of Democracy -- 1886|website=www.cooperative-individualism.org|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} Nietzsche claimed that in a democracy "[w]hen the individual's highest and strongest instincts break forth with a passion, driving him far and above the average, beyond the lowlands of the herd conscience", "the moral perspective now considers how harmful or harmless an opinion, an emotional state, a will, a talent is to the community, to equality". "Exalted, self-directed spirituality, a will to solitude, even great powers of reason are felt as a danger". "Morality in Europe today is herd animal morality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil / On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzche|first=Friedrich|publisher=Clap Publishing, LLC|year=2018|isbn=1635378443|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manin ====
&lt;blockquote href="The Republic (Plato)"&gt;The real difference between ancient democracies and modern republics lies, according to Madison, in "''the total exclusion of the people in their collective capacity'' from any share in the ''latter'', and not in the ''total exclusion of the representatives of the people'' from the administration of the ''former''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;— [[Bernard Manin]], p. 2 (See: Madison, "Federalist 63," in ''[[The Federalist Papers]],'' p. 387; Madison's emphasis.)&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Bernard Manin]] is interested in distinguishing modern representative [[republic]]s, such as the United States, from ancient direct [[Democracy|democracies]], such as Athens.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin believes that both aspire to "rule of the people," but that the nature of modern representative republics lends them to "rule of the aristocratic." Manin explains that in ancient democracies, virtually every citizen had the chance to be selected to populate the government but in modern republics, only elites have the chance of being elected. He does not defend this phenomenon but rather seeks to describe it.

Manin draws from [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to suggest that the dominant form of government, representative as opposed to direct, is effectively aristocratic.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; He proposes that modern representative governments exercise political power through aristocratic elections which, in turn, brings into question democracy's "rule of the people" principle. As far as Montesquieu is concerned, elections favor the "best" citizens who Manin notes tend to be wealthy and upper-class. As far as Rousseau is concerned, elections favor the incumbent government officials or the citizens with the strongest personalities, which results in hereditary aristocracy. Manin further evinces the aristocratic nature of representative governments by contrasting them with the ancient style of selection by lot. Manin notes that [[Montesquieu]] believed that lotteries prevent jealousy and distribute offices equally (among citizens from different ranks), while [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] believed that lotteries choose indifferently, preventing self-interest and partiality from polluting the citizen's choice (and thus prevent hereditary aristocracy).

However, Manin also provides criticism of direct democracy, or selection by lot.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin reflects on Montesquieu's interrogation of the extent to which [[Athenian democracy|Athenian direct democracy]] was truly direct. Montesquieu finds that citizens who had reason to believe they would be accused as "unworthy of selection" commonly withheld their names from the lottery, thereby making selection by lot vulnerable to self-selection bias and, thus, aristocratic in nature. Manin does not dwell on direct democracy's potentially aristocratic elements, perhaps because he share's Montesquieu's belief that there is nothing alarming about the exclusion of citizens who may be incompetent; this exclusion may be inevitable in any method of selection.

Additionally, Manin is interested in explaining the discrepancy between 18th century American and French revolutionaries' ''declaration'' of the "equality of all citizens" and their ''enactment'' of (aristocratic) elections in their respective democratic experiments.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin suggests that the discrepancy is explained by the revolutionaries' contemporary preoccupation with one form of equality over another. The revolutionaries prioritized gaining the equal right to consent to their choice of government (even a potentially aristocratic democracy), at the expense of seeking the equal right to be face of that democracy. And it is elections, not lots, that provide citizens with more opportunities to consent. In elections, citizens consent both to the procedure of elections and to the product of the elections (even if they produce the election of elites). In lotteries, citizens consent only to the procedure of lots, but not to the product of the lots (even if they produce election of the average person). That is, if the revolutionaries prioritized consent to be governed over equal opportunity to serve as the government, then their choice of elections over lotteries makes sense.

====Michels====
A major scholarly attack on the basis of democracy was made by German-Italian political scientist [[Robert Michels]] who developed the mainstream political science theory of the [[iron law of oligarchy]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="hyland"&gt;James L. Hyland. ''Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Manchester University Press ND, 1995. Pp. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Michels argued that [[oligarchy]] is inevitable as an "[[iron law of oligarchy|iron law]]" within any organization as part of the "tactical and technical necessities" of organization and on the topic of democracy, Michels stated: "It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the mandataries over the mandators, of the delegates over the delegators. Who says organization, says oligarchy" and went on to state "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy."&lt;ref name="hyland" /&gt; Michels stated that the official goal of democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that democracy is a [[façade]] legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, that he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable.&lt;ref name="hyland" /&gt; Michels had formerly been a Marxist but became drawn to the syndicalism of Sorel, [[Eduoard Berth]], [[Arturo Labriola]], and [[Enrico Leone (economist)|Enrico Leone]] and had become strongly opposed parliamentarian, legalistic, and bureaucratic socialism of [[social democracy]] and in contrast supported an activist, voluntarist, anti-parliamentarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=418|title=World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia|author=Blamires, Cyprian|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|year=2006|volume=1|location=Santa Barbara, California|page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michels would later become a supporter of fascism upon Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, viewing fascism's goal to destroy liberal democracy in a sympathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=418|title=World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia|author=Blamires, Cyprian|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|year=2006|volume=1|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=418–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maurras====
[[Charles Maurras]], an FRS member of the ''[[Action française]]'' movement, stated in a famous dictum "Democracy is evil, democracy is death." Maurras' concept of ''politique naturelle'' declared recognition of inescapable biological inequality and thereby natural hierarchies, and claimed that the individual is naturally subordinated to social collectivities such as the family, the society, and the state, which he claims are doomed to fail if based upon the "myth of equality" or "abstract liberty". Maurras criticized democracy as being a "government by numbers" in which quantity matters more over quality and prefers the worst over the best. Maurras denounced the principles of [[liberalism]] as described in ''[[The Social Contract]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and in ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' as based upon the false assumption of liberty and the false assumption of equality. He claimed that the [[parliamentary system]] subordinates the national interest, or common good, to private interests of a parliament's representatives where only short-sighted interests of individuals prevail.

====Lagardelle====
French revolutionary [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Hubert Lagardelle]] claimed that French revolutionary syndicalism came to being as the result of "the reaction of the [[proletariat]] against democracy," which he claimed was "the ''popular form'' of [[bourgeois]] dominance." Lagardelle opposed democracy for its universalism, and believed in the necessity of class separation of the proletariat from the bourgeoisie, as democracy did not recognize the social differences between them.

====Shach====
Israeli politician Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]] promoted [[Halakha|Judaic law]] to be the natural governance for [[Jews]] and condemned democracy, he claimed that "Democracy as a machinery of lies, false notions, pursuit of narrow interests and deceit - as opposed to the [[Torah]] regime, which is based on seeking the ultimate truth." Shach criticized democracy for having no real goals, saying "The whole point of democracy is money. The one does what the other asks him to do in pursuit of his own interest, so as to be given what he himself asks for, and the whole purpose of the transaction is that each would get what they want."

== Criticism of democracy's process ==

===Political instability===
More recently, democracy is criticized for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tend to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the mass media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priority.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7646295.stm|title=Head to head: African democracy|last=Richburg|first=Keith|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anthony Downs argued that the political market works much the same way as the economic market, and that there could potentially be an equilibrium in the system because of democratic process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he eventually argued that imperfect knowledge in politicians and voters prevented the reaching of that equilibrium.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Anthony|last2=|first2=|date=April 1957|title=An Economic Theory of Political Action in a Democracy|journal=Journal of Political Economy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=65|issue=2|pages=135–150|doi=10.1086/257897|jstor=1827369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Short-termism====
Democracy is also criticised for frequent elections due to the instability of coalition governments. Coalitions are frequently formed ''after'' the elections in many countries (for example [[India]]) and the basis of alliance is predominantly to enable a viable majority, not an ideological concurrence.

This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.

Democratic institutions work on consensus to decide an issue, which usually takes longer than a unilateral decision.

[[M. S. Golwalkar]] in his book [[Bunch of Thoughts]] describes democracy as, "is to a very large extent only a myth in practice...The high-sounding concept of "individual freedom" only meant the freedom of those talented few to exploit the rest."

====Corruption====
This is a simple form of appealing to the short term interests of the voters.

Another form is commonly called [[Pork barrel]], where local areas or political sectors are given special benefits but whose costs are spread among all [[taxpayers]].

Mere elections are just one aspect of the democratic process. Other tenets of democracy, like relative equality and freedom, are frequently absent in ostensibly democratic countries.

Moreover, in many countries, democratic participation is less than 50% at times, and it can be argued that election of individual(s) instead of ideas disrupts democracy.

==== Potential incompatibility with former politics ====
The new establishment of democratic institutions, in countries where the associated practices have as yet been uncommon or deemed culturally unacceptable, can result in institutions that are not sustainable in the long term. One circumstance supporting this outcome may be when it is part of the common perception among the populace that the institutions were established as a direct result of foreign pressure.

Sustained regular inspection from democratic countries, however effortful and well-meaning, are normally not sufficient in preventing the erosion of democratic practices. In the cases of several African countries, corruption still is rife in spite of democratically elected governments, as one of the most severe examples, Zimbabwe, is often perceived to have backfired into outright militarism.

===Efficiency of the system===
Economist Donald Wittman has written numerous works attempting to counter criticisms of democracy common among his colleagues. He argues democracy is efficient based on the premise of rational voters, competitive elections, and relatively low political transactions costs. Economist Bryan Caplan argues that, while Wittman makes strong arguments for the latter two points, the first is vitiated by the insurmountable evidence for voter irrationality. The problem is not merely the voters' lack of information, but their poor judgement. For many voters, the difficulty of learning about a particular issue is too high compared to the likely costs of ignorance, but this ignorance does not lessen their enthusiasm for voting.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Bryan. [http://econjwatch.org/articles/from-friedman-to-wittman-the-transformation-of-chicago-political-economy ''"From Friedman to Wittman: The Transformation of Chicago Political Economy"''], Econ Journal Watch, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists, such as Meltzer and Richard, have added that as industrial activity in a democracy increases, so too do the people's demands for subsidies and support from the government. By the [[median voter theorem]], only a few people actually hold the balance of power in the country, and many may be unhappy with their decisions. In this way, they argue, democracies are inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzer|first=Allan H.|last2=Richard|first2=Scott F.|date=October 1981|title=A Rational Theory of the Size of Government|journal=Journal of Political Economy|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|volume=89|issue=5|pages=914–927|doi=10.1086/261013|jstor=1830813|accessdate=April 28, 2014|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1749&amp;context=tepper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a system could result in a wealth disparity or racial discrimination. Fierlbeck (1998) points out that such a result is not necessarily due to a failing in the democratic process, but rather, "because democracy is responsive to the desires of a large middle class increasingly willing to disregard the muted voices of economically marginalized groups within its own borders."&lt;ref&gt;Shrag, P. (1956), "india elected anarchy." ''nehru'', 289(1734), 50-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The will of the democratic majority may not always be in the best interest of all citizens.

=== Susceptibility to propaganda ===

====Lack of political education====
{{See also|Low information voter|Low-information rationality|Deliberative democracy|Meritocracy}}
Voters may not be educated enough to exercise their democratic rights prudently. Politicians may take advantage of voters' irrationality, and compete more in the field of [[public relations]] and tactics, than in ideology. While arguments against democracy are often taken by advocates of democracy as an attempt to maintain or revive traditional hierarchy and autocratic rule, many extensions have been made to develop the argument further.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In Lipset's 1959 essay about the requirements for forming democracy, he found that almost all emerging democracies provided good education. However, education alone cannot sustain a democracy, though Caplan did note in 2005 that as people become educated, they think more like economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bendix|first=Reinhard|last2=Lipset|first2=Seymour M.|date=June 1957|title=Political Sociology|url=http://csi.sagepub.com/content/6/2/79.extract|journal=Current Sociology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=79–99|doi=10.1177/001139215700600201|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manipulation or control of public opinion ====

Politicians and special interests have attempted to manipulate [[public opinion]] for as long as recorded history − this has put into question the feasibility of democratic government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Lawrence R.|date=1 December 2001|title=Commentary: Manipulators and Manipulation: Public Opinion in a Representative Democracy|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/15635|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1361–1374|issn=1527-1927|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07393148.2015.1125119?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=cnps20|title=Manipulating Citizens: How Political Campaigns’ Use of Behavioral Social Science Harms Democracy|last1=Gorton|first1=William A.|date=2 January 2016|website=New Political Science|pages=61–80|doi=10.1080/07393148.2015.1125119|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that mass media actually shapes public opinion, and can therefore be used to "control" democracy.

In the United States the FBI was criticized for announced that the agency would examine potentially incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server just 11 days before the election.&lt;ref name="wash1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/12/was-the-2016-u-s-election-democratic-we-see-7-serious-shortfalls/|title=Was the 2016 U.S. election democratic?

In 2016 [[Andrés Sepúlveda]] disclosed that he manipulated public opinion to rig elections in Latin America. According to him with a budget of $600,000 he led a team of hackers that stole campaign strategies, manipulated [[social media]] to create false waves of enthusiasm and derision, and installed [[spyware]] in opposition offices to help [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], a right-of-center candidate, win the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-to-hack-an-election/|title=How to Hack an Election|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/political-cyberhacker-andres-sepulveda-reveals-how-he-digitally-rigged-elections-across-latin-a6965161.html|title=Man claims he rigged elections in most Latin American countries over 8 years|date=2 April 2016|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manipulation of the opposition====
{{Further|Suppression of dissent}}
Various reasons can be found for eliminating or suppressing political opponents. Methods such as [[false flag]]s, [[Anti-terrorism legislation|counterterrorism-laws]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VYIAQAAMAAJ|title=Chronicles|publisher=Rockford Institute|language=en|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; planting or creating compromising material and perpetuation of public fear may be used to suppress dissent. After a failed [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]] over 110,000 people have been purged and nearly 40,000 have been imprisoned in Turkey, which is or was considered to be a democratic nation, during the [[2016 Turkish purges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/269f0b22-8a27-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731|title=Turkey’s crackdown on dissent has gone too far|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2016/11/02/turkeys-ruthless-slow-motion-coup-110000-purged-as-western-ally-cracks-down-on-dissent-journalism/|title=Turkey’s ruthless, slow-motion coup: 110,000 purged as Western ally cracks down on dissent, journalism|last1=Norton|first1=Ben|publisher=Salon|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fake parties, phantom political rivals and "scarecrow" opponents may be used to undermine the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Virtual politics : faking democracy in the post-Soviet world|last1=Wilson|first1=Andrew|date=2005|publisher=Yale Univ.

=== Limited responsiveness and representation ===
Robert A. Dahl defines democracies as systems of government that respond nearly fully to each and every one of their citizens. He then poses that no such, fully responsive system exists today.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; However, this does not mean that ''partially'' democratic regimes do not exist—they do. Thus, Dahl rejects a democracy dichotomy in favor of a democratization spectrum. To Dahl, the question is not whether a country is a democracy or not. The question is to what extent a country is experiencing democratization at a national level. Dahl measures this democratization in terms of the country's endorsement and reception of public contestation. And polyarchy, or "rule of the many people," is the only existing form of democratizeable government; that is, it is within polyarchies that democratization can flourish. Countries do not immediately transform from hegemonies and competitive oligarchies into democracies. Instead, a country that adopts democracy as its form of government can only claim to have switched to polyarchy, which is conducive to, but does not guarantee, democratization. Dahl's polyarchy spectrum ends at the point in which a country becomes a full polyarchy at the national level and begins to democratize at the subnational level, among its social and private affairs. Dahl is not deeply concerned about the limits of his polyarchy spectrum because he believes that most countries today still have a long way before they reach full polyarchy status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Revolution? Authority in a Good Society|last=Dahl|first=Robert A.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Dahl, whatever lies beyond full polyarchy is only possible, and thus only a concern, for advanced countries like the Western Europe.

== Criticism of democracy's outcome ==

===Mob rule===
{{Main|Ochlocracy}}
[[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of [[Socrates]]: "Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''the Republic of Plato'' (London: J.M Dent &amp; Sons LTD.; New York: E.P. Dutton &amp; Co. Inc.), 558-C.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Plato lists 5 forms of government from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only [[Utopia|Kallipolis]], an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a [[justice|just]] form of government.

Plato rejected [[Athenian democracy]] on the basis that such democracies were anarchic societies without internal unity, that they followed citizens' impulses rather than pursuing the common good, that democracies are unable to allow a sufficient number of their citizens to have their voices heard, and that such democracies were typically run by fools. Plato attacked Athenian democracies for mistaking anarchy for freedom. The lack of coherent unity in Athenian democracy made Plato conclude that such democracies were a mere collection of individuals occupying a common space rather than a form of political organization.

According to Plato, other forms of government place too much focus on lesser virtues and degenerate into other forms from best to worst, starting with [[timocracy]], which overvalues honour, then [[oligarchy]], which overvalues wealth, which is followed by democracy. In democracy, the oligarchs, or merchant, are unable to wield their power effectively and the people take over, electing someone who plays on their wishes (for example, by throwing lavish festivals). However, the government grants the people too much freedom, and the state degenerates into the fourth form, [[tyranny]], or [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Michels, Robert. [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/MicPoli.html ''Political Parties – A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy,''] Jarrold &amp; Sons. London, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oppression by the majority====
{{Further|Tyranny of the majority}}
The [[constitutions]] of many countries have parts of them that restrict the nature of the types of laws that [[legislatures]]
can pass.  A fundamental idea behind some of these restrictions, is that the majority of a population and its elected legislature can often be the source of minority persecutions, such as with [[racial discrimination]]. For example, during the mid-1930s and mid-1970s in the democratic country of Sweden, the government forcibly sterilized thousands of innocent women. They were sterilized due to "'mental defects', or simply because they were of mixed race."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.inter.nl.net/users/Paul.Treanor/democracy.html|title=Why democracy is wrong|website=web.inter.nl.net|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second example is when, in 2014 in Pakistan, "a Christian couple were burnt alive in a brick kiln by a mob for their alleged burning of the pages of Quran."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khilafah.com/capitalism-and-democracy-have-failed-to-protect-the-rights-of-minorities/|title=The Khilafah|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by little police retaliation and a statement from the President of Pakistan stating that his government would protect the rights and interests of the Christian community. Some countries throughout the world have judiciaries where judges can serve for long periods of time, and often serve under appointed posts. This is often balanced, however, by the fact that some trials are decided by [[juries]]. While many, like Wittman, have argued that democracies work much the same way as the free market and that there is competition among parties to prevent oppression by the majority, others have argued that there is actually very little competition among political parties in democracies due to the high cost associated with campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jlecono1&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Competition and Democracy|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|year=1958|publisher=HeinOnline|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John T. Wenders, a professor of Economics at the [[University of Idaho]], writes:

{{quote|"Freedom and democracy are different. In words attributed to Scottish historian Alexander Tytler: 'A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until a majority of voters discover that they can vote themselves largess out of the public treasury.' Democracy evolves into kleptocracy. A majority bullying a minority is just as bad as a dictator, communist or otherwise, doing so. Democracy is two coyotes and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Democracy Would Doom Hong Kong|first=John T.|last=Wenders|publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|date=January 1, 1998|accessdate=April 27, 2014|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/democracy-would-doom-hong-kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Additionally, some political scientists question the notion that majority rule is an "uncontested good."&lt;ref&gt;Fierlbeck, K. (1998) ''Globalizing Democracy: Power, Legitimacy and the Interpretation of democratic ideas.'' (p. 13) Manchester University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; If we base our critique on the definition of democracy as governance based on the will of the majority, there can be some foreseeable consequences to this form of rule. For example, Fierlbeck (1998: 12) points out that the middle class majority in a country may decide to redistribute wealth and resources into the hands of those that they feel are most capable of investing or increasing them. Of course this is only a critique of a subset of types of democracy that primarily use majority rule.

US President [[James Madison]] devoted the whole of [[Federalist No. 10]] to a scathing critique of democracy and offered that republics are a far better solution, saying: "...democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths." Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against tyranny of the majority, stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: "the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic".

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] intended to address this criticism by combining democracy with [[republicanism]]. A [[constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. [https://archive.org/stream/essaysongovernm01lowegoog#page/n70/mode/2up ''"Democracy and the Constitution,"''] Essays on Government, Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co. New York, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; would limit the powers of what a simple majority can accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Madison]], [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm Federalist No. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyclical theory of government====
[[Machiavelli]] put the idea that democracies will tend to cater to the whims of the people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZzHJlvXD-YC|title=Alexis de Tocqueville and the Art of Democratic Statesmanship|last1=Danoff|first1=Brian|last2=Hebert|first2=Louie Joseph|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7391-4529-6|page=88|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; who follow false ideas to entertain themselves, squander their reserves, and do not deal with potential threats to their rule until it is too late. He put forth a cyclical theory of government where monarchies tend to decay into aristocracies, which then decay into democracies, which subsequently decay into anarchy, then tyranny, then return to monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWJtAAAAQBAJ|title=The Foundations of Evolutionary Institutional Economics: Generic Institutionalism|last=Wäckerle|first=Manuel|date=August 15, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-81076-0|page=302|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYVZ3TjL0-UC|title=Models of Democracy|last=Held|first=David|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=9780804754729|page=40|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the timeline of France before, during, and after the Revolution until the last Bourbon Monarch.

However Machiavelli's definition of democracy was narrower than the current one. He hypothesized that a hybrid system of government incorporating facets of all three major types (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy) could break this cycle. Many modern democracies that have [[separation of powers]] are claimed to represent these kinds of hybrid governments. However, in modern democracies there is usually no direct correlation with Machiavelli's idea, because of weakening of the separation of powers, or erosion of the original function of the various branches. For example, the modern United States executive branch has slowly accumulated more power from the legislative branch, and the Senate no longer functions as a quasi-aristocratic body as was originally intended, since senators are now democratically elected.

===Political Coase theorem===
Some have tried to argue that the [[Coase theorem]] applies to political markets as well. [[Daron Acemoglu]], however, provides evidence to the contrary, claiming that the Coase Theorem is only valid while there are "rules of the game," so to speak, that are being enforced by the government. But when there is nobody there to enforce the rules for the government itself, there is no way to guarantee that low transaction costs will lead to an efficient outcome in democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|authorlink=Daron Acemoglu|date=2003|title=Why Not A Political Coase Theorem? Social Conflict, Commitment, And Politics|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|volume=31|issue=4|pages=620–652|doi=10.1016/j.jce.2003.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital Radio Mondiale''' ('''DRM'''; ''mondiale'' being [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] for "worldwide") is a set of [[digital radio|digital audio broadcasting]] technologies designed to work over the bands currently used for analogue radio broadcasting including [[AM broadcasting]], particularly [[shortwave]], and [[FM broadcasting]]. DRM is more spectrally efficient than AM and FM, allowing more stations, at higher quality, into a given amount of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], using various [[MPEG-4]] [[audio coding format]]s.

Digital Radio Mondiale is also the name of the international [[non-profit]] [[consortium]] that has designed the platform and is now promoting its introduction. [[Radio France Internationale]], [[TéléDiffusion de France]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Voice of America]], [[Telefunken]] (now [[Transradio]]) and Thomcast (now [[Ampegon]]) took part at the formation of the DRM consortium.

The principle of DRM is that bandwidth is the limited element, and computer processing power is cheap; modern [[Central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive audio compression techniques enable more efficient use of available bandwidth, at the expense of processing resources.

==Features==

DRM can deliver up to [[frequency modulation|FM]]-comparable sound quality{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} on frequencies below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[long wave]], [[medium wave]] and [[short wave]]), which allow for very-long-distance signal propagation. The modes for these lower frequencies are often collectively known under the term "DRM30". In the VHF bands, the term "DRM+" is used. DRM+ is able to use available broadcast spectra between 30 and 300&amp;nbsp;MHz; generally this means band I (47 to 68&amp;nbsp;MHz), band II (87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz) and band III (174 to 230&amp;nbsp;MHz). DRM has been designed to be able to re-use portions of existing analogue [[transmitter]] facilities such as antennas, feeders, and, especially for DRM30, the transmitters themselves, avoiding major new investment. DRM is robust against the fading and interference which often plague conventional broadcasting in these frequency ranges.

The encoding and decoding can be performed with [[digital signal processing]], so that a cheap [[embedded system|embedded]] computer with a conventional transmitter and receiver can perform the rather complex encoding and decoding.

As a digital medium, DRM can transmit other data besides the audio channels ([[datacasting]]) &amp;mdash; as well as [[RBDS|RDS]]-type [[metadata]] or [[program-associated data]] as [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) does. DRM services can be operated in many different network configurations, from a traditional AM one-service one-transmitter model to a multi-service (up to four) multi-transmitter model, either as a [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) or [[multi-frequency network]] (MFN). Hybrid operation, where the same transmitter delivers both analogue and DRM services simultaneously is also possible.

DRM incorporates technology known as Emergency Warning Features that can override other programming and activates radios which are in standby in order to receive emergency broadcasts.

==Status==
The technical standard is available free-of-charge from the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/201900_201999/201980/04.01.01_60/es_201980v040101p.pdf|title=DRM System specification|author=|date=|website=etsi.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] has approved its use in most of the world. Approval for [[ITU region|ITU region 2]] is pending amendments to existing international agreements. The inaugural broadcast took place on June 16, 2003, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], at the ITU's [[World Radio Conference]].

Current broadcasters include [[All India Radio]], [[BBC World Service]], [[BitExpress]], [[Radio Exterior de España]], [[Radio New Zealand International]], [[Vatican Radio]], [[Radio Romania International]] and Radio Kuweit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm.org/?page_id=151|title=Digital Radio Mondiale -   Broadcast Schedule|author=|date=|website=www.drm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until now DRM receivers have typically used a [[personal computer]]. A few manufacturers have introduced DRM receivers which have thus far remained niche products due to limited choice of broadcasts. It is expected that the transition of national broadcasters to digital services on DRM, notably All India Radio, will stimulate the production of a new generation of affordable, and efficient receivers.

[[Chengdu NewStar Electronics]] is offering the DR111 from May 2012 on which meets the minimum requirements for DRM receivers specified by the DRM consortium and is sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DR111 DRM Radio |publisher=Chengdu NewStar Electronics &amp;#124; 成都纽斯达电子公司: |year=2014 |url=http://www.cdnse.com/products/dr111 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Overseas Service of [[All India Radio]] broadcasts daily in DRM to Western Europe on 9.95&amp;nbsp;MHz at 17:45 to 22:30 UTC.&lt;ref&gt;http://allindiaradio.gov.in/Services/Digital%20Transmission/Pages/simple.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  [[All India Radio]] is in the process of replacing and refurbishing many of its domestic AM transmitters with DRM.

The British Broadcasting Corporation [[BBC]] has trialed the technology in the [[United Kingdom]] by broadcasting [[BBC Radio Devon]] in the Plymouth area in the MF band. The [http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/digitalmediumwave/faqs_feature.shtml trial] lasted for a year (April 2007 – April 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2009/05/11/digital_medium_wave_report_feature.shtml|title=Digital medium wave trial report|first=|last=BBC|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[BBC]] also trialed DRM+ in the FM band in 2010 from the [[Craigkelly transmitting station]] in [[Fife]], Scotland, over an area which included the city of [[Edinburgh]]. In this trial, a previously used 10&amp;nbsp;kW (ERP) FM transmitter was replaced with a 1&amp;nbsp;kW DRM+ transmitter in two different modes and the coverage compared with FM &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP199.pdf|title=BBC Research White Paper WHP199|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Digital Radio Mondiale was included in the 2007 [[Ofcom]] consultation on the future of radio in the [[United Kingdom]] for the AM medium wave band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ The Future of Radio (Ofcom, 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043938/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÉ has also run single and multiple programme overnight tests during a similar period on the 252&amp;nbsp;kHz LW transmitter in Trim, Co.Meath, Ireland which was upgraded to support DRM after [[Atlantic 252]] closed.

The Fraunhofer Institute for integrated circuits IIS offers a package for software defined radios which can be licensed to radio manufacturers. [http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/pr/2016/20160310_KS_Software_DRM.html]

===International regulation===
On 28 September 2006, the [[Australia]]n spectrum regulator, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], announced that it had "placed an embargo on frequency bands potentially suitable for use by broadcasting services using Digital Radio Mondiale until spectrum planning can be completed" "those bands being "5,950–6,200; 7,100–7,300; 9,500–9,900; 11,650–12,050; 13,600–13,800; 15,100–15,600; 17,550–17,900; 21,450–21,850 and 25,670–26,100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]]: [http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/radcomm/frequency_planning/spectrum_embargoes/embargo44.pdf Embargo on new frequency assignments to support domestic broadcasting services using DRM tecxhnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] states in {{CodeFedReg|47|73|758}} that:  "For digitally modulated emissions, the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) standard shall be employed."  Part 73, section 758 is for [[high frequency|HF]] broadcasting only.

==Technological Overview==

===Audio source coding===
Useful bitrates for DRM30 range from 6.1 kbit/s (Mode D) to 34.8 kbit/s (Mode A) for a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth (±5&amp;nbsp;kHz around the central frequency). It is possible to achieve bit rates up to 72 kbit/s (Mode A) by using a standard 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (±10&amp;nbsp;kHz) wide channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.drm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DRM-guide-artwork-9-2013-1.pdf
|format=PDF; 6.7&amp;nbsp;MB
|title=DRM Introduction and Implementation Guide
|page=22
|publisher=DRM
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, pure digital [[HD Radio]] can broadcast 20 kbit/s using channels 10&amp;nbsp;kHz wide and up to 60 kbit/s using 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channels.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |title=The Structure and Generation of Robust Waveforms for AM In-Band On-Channel Digital Broadcasting |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206042040/http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Useful bitrate depends also on other parameters, such as:
* desired robustness to errors ([[Forward error correction|error coding]])
* power needed ([[modulation]] scheme)
* robustness in regard to propagation conditions ([[multipath propagation]], [[doppler effect]]), etc.

When DRM was originally designed, it was clear that the most robust modes offered insufficient capacity for the then state-of-the-art audio coding format [[MPEG-4]] [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). Therefore, the standard launched with a choice of three different audio coding systems (source coding) depending on the bitrate:
*[[MPEG-4]]  [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). AAC is a perceptual coder suited for voice and music and the High Efficiency is an optional extension for reconstruction of high frequencies (SBR: spectral bandwidth replication) and stereo image (PS: Parametric Stereo). 24&amp;nbsp;kHz or 12&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling frequencies can be used for core AAC (no SBR) which correspond respectively to 48&amp;nbsp;kHz and 24&amp;nbsp;kHz when using SBR oversampling.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[CELP]] which is a parametric coder suited for voice only (vocoder) but that is robust to errors and needs a small bit rate.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[HVXC]] which is also a parametric coder for speech programs that uses an even smaller bitrate than CELP.

However, with the development of [[MPEG-4]] [[xHE-AAC]], which is an implementation of MPEG [[Unified Speech and Audio Coding]], the DRM standard was updated and the two speech-only coding formats, CELP and HVXC, were replaced. USAC is designed to combine the properties of a speech and a general audio coding according to bandwidth constraints and so is able to handle all kinds of programme material. Given that there were few CELP and HVXC broadcasts on-air, the decision to drop the speech-only coding formats has passed without issue.

Many broadcasters still use the [[HE-AAC]] coding format because it still offers an acceptable audio quality, somewhat comparable to [[FM broadcasting|FM broadcast]] at bitrates above about 15 kbit/s. However, it is anticipated that in future, most broadcasters will adopt [[xHE-AAC]].

Additionally, as of v2.1, the popular Dream software can broadcast using the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] coding format. Whilst not within the current DRM standard the inclusion of this codec is provided for experimentation. Aside from perceived technical advantages over the MPEG family such as low latency (delay between coding and decoding), this codec provides an open source (therefore free to use) alternative to the proprietary MPEG family whose use is permitted at the discretion of the patent holders, unfortunately it has a substantially lower audio quality than xHE-AAC on low bitrates, which are a key to conserve bandwidth. In fact, at 8Kbps Opus actually sounds worse than analog shortwave radio. A video showing the comparison between Opus and xHE-AAC is available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEUwScTX-R4 here]. Equipment manufacturers currently pay royalties for incorporating the MPEG codecs.

===Bandwidth===
DRM broadcasting can be done using a choice of different bandwidths:

*4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 9&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for [[amplitude modulation|AM]], with a 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102500_102599/102509/01.01.01_60/ts_102509v010101p.pdf |title=See section 5: "DRM/AM single channel simulcast"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is not good.
*5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for AM, with a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband. However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is marginal (7.1–16.7&amp;nbsp;kbit/s for 5&amp;nbsp;kHz). This technique could be used on the [[short wave]] bands throughout the world. 
*9&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave broadcast channel.
*10&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;2 broadcast channel. could be used to simulcast with analogue audio channel restricted to NRSC5. Occupies a full worldwide short wave broadcast channel (giving 14.8–34.8 kbit/s)
*18&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave channels according to the existing frequency plan. This offers better audio quality.
*20&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;2 or region 3 AM channel according to the existing frequency plan. This offers highest audio quality of the DRM30 standard (giving 30.6–72&amp;nbsp;kbit/s).
* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz for DRM+. This bandwidth can be used in band I, II, and III and DRM+ can transmit four different programs in this bandwidth or even one low definition digital video channel.

===Modulation===
The modulation used for DRM is coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ([[COFDM]]), where every carrier is modulated with quadrature amplitude modulation ([[QAM]]) with a selectable error coding.

The choice of transmission parameters depends on signal robustness wanted and propagation conditions. Transmission signal is affected by noise, interference, multipath wave propagation and [[Doppler effect]].

It is possible to choose among several error coding schemes and several modulation patterns: 64-QAM, 16-QAM and 4-QAM. OFDM modulation has some parameters that must be adjusted depending on propagation conditions. This is the carrier spacing which will determine the robustness against Doppler effect (which cause frequencies offsets, spread: Doppler spread) and OFDM guard interval which determine robustness against multipath propagation (which cause delay offsets, spread: delay spread). The DRM consortium has determined four different profiles corresponding to typical propagation conditions:
*A: Gaussian channel with very little multipath propagation and Doppler effect. This profile is suited for local or regional broadcasting.
*B: multipath propagation channel. This mode is suited for medium range transmission. It is nowadays frequently used.
*C: similar to mode B, but with better robustness to Doppler (more carrier spacing). This mode is suited for long distance transmission.
*D: similar to mode B, but with a resistance to large delay spread and Doppler spread. This case exists with adverse propagation conditions on very long distance transmissions. The useful bit rate for this profile is decreased.

The trade-off between these profiles stands between robustness, resistance in regards to propagation conditions and useful bit rates for the service. This table presents some values depending on these profiles. The larger the carrier spacing, the more the system is resistant to Doppler effect (Doppler spread). The larger the guard interval, the greater the resistance to long multipath propagation errors (delay spread).

The resulting low-[[bit rate]] digital information is [[modulation|modulated]] using [[COFDM]]. It can run in [[simulcast]] mode by switching between DRM and AM, and it is also prepared for linking to other alternatives (e.g., [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] or FM services).

DRM has been tested successfully on [[shortwave]], [[mediumwave]] (with 9 as well as 10 [[kHz]] [[channel spacing]]) and [[longwave]].

There is also a lower bandwidth two-way communication version of DRM as a replacement for SSB communications on HF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://n1su.com/windrm/|title=WinDRM] - software for Audio and Fast Data over HF SSB |author=|date=|website=n1su.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - note that it is ''not'' compatible with the official DRM specification. It may be possible in some future time for the 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth DRM version used by the Amateur Radio community to be merged with the existing DRM specification.

The Dream software will receive the commercial versions and also limited transmission mode using the FAAC AAC encoder.

===Error coding===
Error coding can be chosen to be more or less robust.

The lower the protection class the higher the level of error correction.

==DRM+ ==
While the initial DRM standard covered the broadcasting bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz, the DRM consortium voted in March 2005 to begin the process of extending the system to the VHF bands up to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151234/http://www.drm.org/uploads/files/drm_plus_pres.pdf DRM+ Presentation], DRM.org, accessed 2009-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2009, DRM+ (Mode E) became an official broadcasting standard with the publication of the technical specification by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]; this is effectively a new release of the whole DRM spec with the additional mode permitting operation above 30&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 174&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;ETSI ES 201 980 V3.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Wider bandwidth channels are used, which allows radio stations to use higher bit rates, thus providing higher audio quality. A 100&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM+ channel has sufficient capacity to carry one low-definition 0.7 megabit/s wide mobile TV channel: it would be feasible to distribute [[mobile TV]] over DRM+ rather than [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]] or [[DVB-H]]. However, DRM+ (DRM Mode E) as designed and standardized only provides bitrates between 37.2 and 186.3&amp;nbsp;kbit/s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DRM Introduction and Implementation Guide | publisher=DRM Consortium | date=13 September 2013 | url=http://www.drm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DRM-guide-artwork-9-2013-1.pdf | pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://drm-forum.de/images/drm-forum/drm-workshop-2016/Use_of_DRMplus_in_the_FM_Band.pdf | title=Use of DRM+ in the FM Band 87.5-108MHz | pages=6 | first=Jens | last=Schroeder | date=April 2016 | publisher=Deutsches DRM-Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on robustness level, using 4-QAM or 16-QAM modulations and 100&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth.

DRM+ has been successfully tested in all the VHF bands, and this gives the DRM system the widest frequency usage; it can be used in band I, II and III. DRM+ can coexist with DAB in band III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm-radio-kl.eu/symposium2010/symposium2010en.htm|title=Symposium DRM+ im VHF-Band III in Kaiserslautern|author=|date=|website=www.drm-radio-kl.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the present FM-band can be utilized. The ITU has published three recommendations on DRM+, known in the documents as Digital System G. This indicate  the introduction of the full DRM system (DRM 30 and DRM+).
ITU-R Rec. BS.1114 is the ITU recommendation for sound broadcasting in the frequency range 30&amp;nbsp;MHz to 3&amp;nbsp;GHz. DAB, HD-Radio and ISDB-T were already recommended in this document as Digital Systems A, C and F respectively.

In 2011, the paneuropean organisation Community Media Forum Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmfe.eu|title=Community Media Forum Europe - Information and Lobbying for the Community Media Sector|author=|date=|website=cmfe.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recommended to the European Commission that DRM+ should rather be used for small scale broadcasting (local radio, community radio) than DAB/DAB+.

The '''Director of National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies''' was a review group formed by the [[Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence of the United States]] in light of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures of 2013]].  In December 2013, the five-member group produced a public report.  

==Formation==
On August 12, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] issued a Presidential Memorandum instructing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, to form a "Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies".  Obama instructed that "The Review Group will assess whether, in light of advancements in communications technologies, the United States employs its technical collection capabilities in a manner that optimally protects our national security and advances our foreign policy while appropriately accounting for other policy considerations, such as the risk of unauthorized disclosure and our need to maintain the public trust."

The memorandum called for an interim report within 60 days of establishment and a final report by December 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/909-dni-clapper-announces-review-group-on-intelligence-and-communications-technologies |title=DNI Clapper Announces Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies |publisher=Dni.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The group included former counter-terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke]], former Acting [[Central Intelligence Agency]] director [[Michael Morell]], [[University of Chicago]] Law professor [[Geoffrey Stone]], former administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs [[Cass Sunstein]] and former Chief Counselor for Privacy in the Office of Management and Budget [[Peter Swire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/intelligence-community/review-group |title=Review Group |publisher=Dni.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harding288"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|authorlink=Luke Harding|title=[[The Snowden Files|The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man]]|date=2014|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780804173520|oclc=870337274|page=288|quote=The panel's chair was Michael Morrell, Obama's former deputy CIA director; two other members included Richard Clarke, a former counter-terrorism co-ordinator under Clinton and George W Bush, and Peter Swire, Clinton's privacy director.

==Report==
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}
The 300-page report, entitled "Liberty and Security in a Changing World", was  released on December 12, 2013. It contained over 40 recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone |first=Geoffrey R. |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116269/barack-obamas-nsa-speech-heres-how-i-grade-his-reforms |title=Barack Obama's NSA Speech: Here's How I Grade His Reforms |publisher=New Republic |date=2014-01-18 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] released a statement criticizing the report, saying "we’re disappointed that the recommendations suggest a path to continue untargeted spying. Mass surveillance is still heinous, even if private company servers are holding the data instead of government data centers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/eff-statement-presidents-review-groups-nsa-report |title=EFF Statement on President's Review Group's NSA Report &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2013-12-18 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/NSA_report.pdf |title=A Critique of the Recoommendations by the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communication Technologies |publisher=Centerforsecuritypolicy.org |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31700">The '''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems''' (EOLSS) is an [[encyclopedia]] on the science of [[sustainable development]] and conservation of [[life support system]]s on [[earth]]. The extensive publication is published under the patronage of [[UNESCO]].

==Overview==
In 1996, international [[scientists]], [[engineers]], and policy makers were invited by the UNESCO to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mexico City]], [[Beijing]] and the [[Bahamas]] to generate a detailed list of EOLSS contents and achieve a global consensus and acceptance of its structure. Life support system means a natural or human constructed system that furthers the life of the [[biosphere]] in a sustainable fashion. The knowledge is structured in 21 topic areas: [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[atmospheric sciences]]; [[Mathematical sciences]]; [[Biological]], [[physiological]] and [[health sciences]]; [[Biotechnology]]; [[Land use]], [[land cover]] and [[soil sciences]]; [[Tropical]] biology and conservation management; [[Social sciences]] and [[humanities]]; [[Physical sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Control systems]], [[robotics]] and [[automation]]; [[Chemical sciences]] engineering and technology resources; [[Water Science|Water sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Energy|Energy sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Environmental and [[ecological |ecological sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Food and agricultural sciences, engineering and technology resources; [[Human resources]] policy, development and management; [[Natural resources]] policy and management; Development and economic sciences; Institutional and infrastructural resources; Technology, information and system management resources; Area studies (Africa, Brazil, Canada and USA, China, Europe, Japan, Russia); [[Desalination]] and water resources.

The way the encyclopedia is being compiled can be defined as [[crowdsourcing]], where thousands of intellectuals from all over the world and across various academic institutions are contributing. The encyclopedia relies on strict standards of [[peer review]] and the joint [[Paris]]-based UNESCO and EOLSS secretariat manages the encyclopedia in progress. It has got a publishing wing in [[Oxford]] as well which specializes in publishing various materials such as [[book]]s, [[e-books]] or scholarly [[subscription]]s.

The web portal of EOLSS receives maximum hits from the [[United States]] and [[India]]. If each hit is assumed to originate from one unique user, then USA has about 28% and India has about 10% of the users of this portal. The number of hits falls dramatically after we consider USA and India, whereas countries like [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and the [[United Kingdom]] each contribute almost about 5% of the total hits. This shows that people familiar with English are feeling more comfortable in utilizing this project for their educational or knowledge seeking purposes and researches. The proportion of users from states of the [[European Union]] who do not speak English as native language is about 8 percent in total. The statistics are updated as of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eolss.net EOLSS, official website], retrieved on 2004-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Av0Yq6cVk EOLSS], Introduction on [[YouTube]], retrieved on 2018-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIFA Women's World Rankings''' for [[Association football|football]] were introduced in 2003,&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; with the first rankings published in March of that year, as a follow-on to the existing [[FIFA World Rankings]] for men. They attempt to compare the strength of internationally active women's national teams at any given time.

==Specifics of the ranking system==
*FIFA Women's World Rankings are based on every international match a team ever played, dating back to 1971, the first FIFA-recognized women's international between [[France women's national football team|France]] and [[Netherlands women's national football team|the Netherlands]].
*FIFA Women's World Rankings are implicitly weighted to emphasize recent results.
*FIFA Women's World Rankings are only published four times a year. Normally, rankings are released in March, June, September and December. (In [[FIFA Women's World Cup|World Cup]] years, dates may be adjusted to reflect the World Cup results.)

The first two points result from the FIFA Women's World Rankings system being based on the [[Elo rating system]] adjusted for football; in 2018, FIFA modified the men's ranking system to similarly be based on Elo systems after continued criticism. FIFA considers the ratings for teams with fewer than 5 matches provisional and at the end of the list. Also any team that plays no matches for 18 months becomes unranked.

==Leaders==
&lt;div style="text-align:center; float:right; clear:right; margin-left: 1em"&gt;'''FIFA Women's&lt;br&gt; World Ranking leaders'''&lt;br&gt;{{FIFA Women's World Ranking leaders}}&lt;/div&gt;
To date Germany and the United States have been the only two teams to have led the rankings. They have also held the top two spots in all but five releases, when Germany was ranked third: [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] was in second position in the first two rankings until Germany overtook them by winning the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]], [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]] was ranked second in March and June 2009 until Germany won [[UEFA Women's Euro 2009|2009 Euro]] and rejoined the top two, and [[England women's national football team|England]] reached the #2 ranking in March 2018.

The United States holds the record for the longest period being ranked first: almost 7 years, from March 2008 to December 2014.

In the latest rankings, action from [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification|Women's World Cup qualifying]] tournaments in [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|UEFA]] and [[2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship qualification|CONCACAF]], as well as the [[2018 Tournament of Nations]], caused movement throughout the rankings, though three of the top five did not change. The United States (#1), Germany (#2), and [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada]] (#5) retained their positions while England (#3) and [[France women's national football team|France]] (#4) swapped. [[Australia women's national football team|Australia]] rose to #6 on a 33-point gain, the largest gain among any of the top 50 teams, though [[Uganda women's national football team|Uganda]] earned the most points of any team with 44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/news/y=2018/m=9/news=matildas-on-the-march-as-usa-stay-top.html|title=Matildas on the march as USA stay top|first=|last=FIFA.com|date=28 September 2018|website=fifa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rankings are based on the following formulae:&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/r&amp;a-wwr/52/00/99/fs-590_06e_wwr-new.pdf| title=Fact Sheet, FIFA Women's World Ranking| accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''&lt;math&gt;R_{aft} = R_{bef} + K (S_{act} - S_{exp})&lt;/math&gt;'''

:'''&lt;math&gt;S_{exp} =  \frac{1}{1 + 10^{-x/2}}&lt;/math&gt;'''
&lt;!-- This is not exactly stated in the reference, but that equation does not give sensible results, while this one matches the general Elo format --&gt;
:'''&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{R_{bef} - O_{bef} \pm H}{c}&lt;/math&gt;'''

Where
{| style="width:50%;"
|-
|width=4%|
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;R_{aft}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The team rating after the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;R_{bef}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The team rating before the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;'''||= '''&lt;math&gt;15 M&lt;/math&gt;''', the weighted importance of the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;S_{act}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The actual result of the match, ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;S_{exp}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The expected result of the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The scaled difference in rating points between the teams&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;O_{bef}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The opposing team's rating before the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The "home advantage" correction, ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'''||= A scaling factor, ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The "Match Importance Factor", ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|}

The average points of all teams are about 1300 points. The top nations usually exceed 2000 points. In order to be ranked, a team must have played at least 5 matches against officially ranked teams, and have not been inactive for more than 18 months. Even if teams are not officially ranked, their points rating is kept constant until they play their next match.

===Actual result of the match===
The main component of the actual result is whether the team wins, loses, or draws, but goal difference is also taken into account.

If the match results in a winner and loser, the loser is awarded a percentage given by the accompanying table, with the result always less than or equal to 20% (for goal differences greater than zero). The result is based on the goal difference and the number of goals they scored. The remaining percentage points are awarded to the winner.  For example, a 2–1 match has the result awarded 84%–16% respectively, a 4–3 match has the result awarded 82%–18%, and an 8–3 match has the result awarded 96.2%–3.8%.  As such, it is possible for a team to lose points even if they win a match, assuming they did not "win by enough".

If the match ends in a draw the teams are awarded the same result, but the number depends on the goals scored so the results will not necessarily add up to 100%.  For example, a 0–0 draws earns both teams 47% each, a 1–1 draw earns 50% each, and a 4–4 draw earns 52.5% each.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

====Actual result table====
The following is from a non-winning perspective (loss or draw). The factor for the winning team adds up to 100.

===Neutral ground or Home vs. Away===
Historically, home teams earn 66% of the points available to them, with away teams earning the other 34%.  To account for this, when two teams are not playing on neutral ground, the home team has its &lt;math&gt;R_{bef}&lt;/math&gt; inflated by 100 points for the purposes of calculation.  That is, if two equally ranked teams playing at one team's home ground, the home team would be expected to win at the same rate a team playing on neutral ground with a 100-point advantage.  This 100 point difference corresponds to a 64%–36% advantage in terms of expected result.

This also helps define the scaling constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, which has a value of 200.  In addition to a 100-point difference causing an expected result difference of 64%–36%, it also results in a 300-point difference causing expected results of 85%–15%.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

The '''Five Eyes''', often abbreviated as '''FVEY''', is an [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence]] alliance comprising [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. These countries are parties to the multilateral [[UKUSA Agreement]], a treaty for joint cooperation in [[signals intelligence]].&lt;ref name="fiveeyes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=James|title=Canada and the Five Eyes Intelligence Community|url=http://cdfai.org.previewmysite.com/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|publisher=[[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]]|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Eyes |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |publisher=[[United States Army Combined Arms Center]] |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archivedate=2 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105224/http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKI Interoperability with FVEY Partner Nations on the NIPRNet |url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |publisher=[[United States Department of the Navy]] |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201113535/http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |archivedate=1 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the FVEY can be traced back to the post–[[World War II]] period, when the [[Atlantic Charter]] was issued by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to lay out their goals for a post-war world. During the course of the [[Cold War]], the [[ECHELON]] surveillance system was initially developed by the FVEY to monitor the communications of the former [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]], although it is now used to monitor billions of private communications worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asser|first=Martin|title=Echelon: Big brother without a cause?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/820758.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=6 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a major debate in the [[European Parliament]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[United States Congress]]. As part of efforts in the ongoing [[War on Terror]] since 2001, the FVEY further expanded their surveillance capabilities, with much emphasis placed on monitoring the [[World Wide Web]]. The former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]] described the Five Eyes as a "[[Supranational union|supra-national]] intelligence organisation that does not answer to the known laws of its own countries".&lt;ref name="ndr" /&gt; Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that the FVEY have been spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [[Constitutional law|domestic regulations]] on surveillance of citizens.&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt;

In spite of continued controversy over its methods, the Five Eyes relationship remains one of the most comprehensive known espionage alliances in history.&lt;ref name="ap1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Nick|title=Experts say US spy alliance will survive Snowden|url=https://news.yahoo.com/experts-us-spy-alliance-survive-snowden-104228309.html|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins (1940s–1950s) ===
[[File:UKUSA1.jpg|thumb|border|The cover page of the first version of the secret [[UKUSA Agreement]] in 1946, which was disclosed to the public in 2011.]]
The origins of the Five Eyes alliance can be traced back to the [[Atlantic Charter]], which was issued in August 1941 to lay out the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] goals for the [[post-war]] world. On 17 May 1943, the British–U.S. Communication Intelligence Agreement, also known as the [[BRUSA Agreement]], was signed by the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[United States|U.S.]] governments to facilitate co-operation between the [[US War Department|U.S. War Department]] and the British [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]]. On 5 March 1946, the [[secret treaty]] was formalized as the [[UKUSA Agreement]], which forms the basis for all [[signal intelligence]] cooperation between the NSA and the GCHQ to this day.&lt;ref name=guardian5eye&gt;{{cite web|last=Farrell|first=Paul|title=History of 5-Eyes – explainer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/history-of-5-eyes-explainer|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=norton5&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|title=Not so secret: deal at the heart of UK-US intelligence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/intelligence-deal-uk-us-released|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the treaty was extended to include Canada, followed by Norway (1952), Denmark (1954), [[West Germany]] (1955), Australia (1956), and New Zealand (1956).&lt;ref name=norton5 /&gt; These countries participated in the alliance as "third parties". By 1955, the formal status of the remaining Five Eyes countries was officially acknowledged in a newer version of the UKUSA Agreement that contained the following statement:

{{quote|At this time only [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] will be regarded as UKUSA-collaborating [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.&lt;ref name=norton5 /&gt;}}

The "Five Eyes" term has its origins as a shorthand for a "AUS/CAN/NZ/UK/US EYES ONLY" ([[AUSCANNZUKUS]]) classification level.&lt;ref name="fiveeyes2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox |first=James |title=Canada and the Five Eyes Intelligence Community |url=http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204055230/http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-04 |publisher=[[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]] |date=December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cold War (1950s–1990s) ===
During the [[Cold War]], the GCHQ and the NSA shared intelligence on the [[Soviet Union]], the People's Republic of China, and several eastern European countries (known as Exotics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aldrich|first=Richard|title=Allied code-breakers co-operate – but not always| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/24/intelligence-sharing-codebreakers-agreement-ukusa| work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 June 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of several decades, the [[ECHELON]] surveillance network was developed to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its [[Eastern Bloc]] allies.&lt;ref name="bbcechelon1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Vietnam War]], Australian and New Zealand operators in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region worked directly to support the United States, while GCHQ operators stationed in the (then) British colony of [[Hong Kong]] were tasked with monitoring [[North Vietnam]]ese air defence networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|title=GCHQ by Richard Aldrich, Securing the State by David Omand|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/19/gchq-intelligence-richard-aldrich|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=19 June 2010|quote=The US was especially keen on GCHQ's station in Hong Kong, particularly during the Vietnam war}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|title=Inside Echelon|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/6/6929/1.html|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=25 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Falklands War]], the British received intelligence data from its FVEY allies such as Australia, as well as from third parties such as Norway and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George|last=Jones|title=How France helped us win Falklands war|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1387576/How-France-helped-us-win-Falklands-war-by-John-Nott.html|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=13 Mar 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ausasis"&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Milliken|title=Canberra spy link to MI6 alleged|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/canberra-spy-link-to-mi6-alleged-1395867.html|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=23 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norsk lyttestasjon viktig brikke i Falklandskrigen |url=http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/brennpunkt/1861285.html |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |language=Norwegian |date=21 May 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629035444/http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/brennpunkt/1861285.html |archivedate=29 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the [[Gulf War]], a technician of the ASIS was used by SIS to bug [[Kuwait]]i government offices.&lt;ref name="ausasis"/&gt;

=== ECHELON network disclosures (1988–2000) ===
By the end of the 20th century, the [[ECHELON]] surveillance network had evolved into a global system capable of sweeping up massive amounts of private and commercial communications, including telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic. This was done through the interception of communication bearers such as satellite transmission and [[public switched telephone network]]s.&lt;ref name = EP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A5-2001-0264+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=On the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system), (2001/2098(INI)) |last=Schmid |first=Gerhard |date=11 July 2001 |format=pdf – 194 pages |publisher=European Parliament: Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Eyes has two types of information collection methods: the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program and the [[Upstream collection]] system. The PRISM program gathers user information from technology firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, while the Upstream system gathers information directly from the communications of civilians via fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1988, Duncan Campbell revealed in the ''New Statesman'' the existence of ECHELON, an extension of the UKUSA Agreement on global signals intelligence [Sigint]. The story, 'Somebody's listening,' detailed how the eavesdropping operations were not only being employed in the interests of 'national security,' but were regularly abused for corporate espionage in the service of US business interests. The piece passed largely unnoticed outside of journalism circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Duncan|title=duncancampbell.org|url=http://www.duncancampbell.org/content/echelon|website=Duncan Campbell.org|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1996, a detailed description of ECHELON was provided by New Zealand journalist [[Nicky Hager]] in a book titled "''[[Nicky Hager#Secret Power|Secret Power – New Zealand's Role in the International Spy Network]]''", which was cited by the [[European Parliament]] in a 1998 report titled "An Appraisal of the Technology of Political Control" (PE 168.184).&lt;ref name=politicaleu&gt;{{cite web|title=An Appraisal of the Technology of Political Control|url=http://www.europarl.eu.int/dg4/stoa/en/publi/166499/execsum.htm|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=27 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990417064814/http://www.europarl.eu.int/dg4/stoa/en/publi/166499/execsum.htm|archivedate=17 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2000, the Parliament called for a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] on the Five Eyes and their ECHELON surveillance network, which, if passed, would have called for the "complete dismantling of ECHELON".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Parliament resolution on Echelon |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&amp;reference=B5-2000-0290&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |accessdate=27 January 2014 |date=16 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months later, the [[Temporary Committee on ECHELON]] was set up by the [[European Parliament]] to investigate the ECHELON surveillance network. However, according to a number of European politicians such as [[Esko Seppänen]] of Finland, these investigations were hindered by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Echelon and the European Parliament |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00b51db9d2/Parliament-in-the-past.html|publisher=[[European Parliament]] |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [[Constitutional law|domestic regulations]] on spying.

While the Five Eyes is a very specific agreement with specific operations amongst the five nations, other non-FVEY sharing agreements have been set up independently and for specific purposes. For example, according to [[Edward Snowden]], the NSA has a "massive body" called the Foreign Affairs Directorate that is responsible for partnering with foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Snowden Interview: The NSA and Its Willing Helpers|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Six Eyes
According to the [[news magazine]] ''[[L'Obs]]'', in 2009, the United States proposed to [[France]] to join the Five Eyes, that would then have become the "Six Eyes". [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] however made the requirement to be granted the same status as other allies, including the signing of a "no-spy agreement". This requirement was approved by the director of the NSA, but not by the director of the CIA, and furthermore not by President [[Barack Obama]], resulting in a refusal from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20150625.OBS1569/exclusif-comment-la-france-ecoute-aussi-le-monde.html|title=EXCLUSIF.

'''Forced displacement''' or '''forced immigration''' is the coerced movement of a person or people away from their [[home]] or home [[region]] and it often connotes violent coercion. Someone who has experienced forced displacement is a '''"forced immigrant"''', a '''"displaced person" (DP)''', rarely also a '''"displacee"''', or if it is within the same country, an [[internally displaced person]] (IDP). In some cases the forced immigrant can also become a [[refugee]], as that term has a specific legal definition. A specific form of forced displacement is [[population transfer]], which is a coherent policy to move unwanted groups, for example, as an attempt at [[ethnic cleansing]]. Another form is [[deportation]].

Forced displacement has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced people to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that the destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], south and central [[Asia]], ripple out well beyond the immediate region.

== Definition ==
The concept of forced displacement envelopes demographic movements like flight, evacuation, displacement, and resettlement. The [[International Organization for Migration]] defines a forced migrant as any person who migrates to "escape persecution, conflict, repression, natural and human-made disasters, ecological degradation, or other situations that endanger their lives, freedom or livelihood".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_160632.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023804/http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Association for the Study of Forced Migration]] (IASFM) defines it as "the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (those displaced by conflicts) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects."&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcedmigration.org/about/whatisfm/what-is-forced-migration|title=What is forced migration? — Forced Migration Online|website=www.forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alden Speare, "in the strictest sense migration can be considered to be involuntary only when a person is physically transported from a country and has no opportunity to escape from those transporting him." Movement under threat, even the immediate threat to life, contains a voluntary element, as long as there is an option to escape to another part of the country, go into hiding or to remain and hope to avoid persecution."&lt;ref name=conflict/&gt; However this thought has been questioned, especially by Marxians, who argue that in most cases migrants have little or no choice.&lt;ref name=conflict&gt;{{cite web |title=FORCED MIGRATION IN INDONESIA : HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES |url=http://www.conflictrecovery.org/bin/Graeme_Hugo-Forced_Migration_in_Indonesia-Historical_Perspectives.doc |work=graeme hugo |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Causes for forced displacement can include:
* [[Natural disaster]]: Occurrence of a disaster – such as floods, tsunamis, landslides, earthquakes or volcanoes – leads to temporary or permanent displacement of population from that area. In such a scenario, migration becomes more of a survival strategy, as natural disasters often cause the loss of money, homes, and jobs. For example, [[Hurricane Katrina]] resulted in displacement of almost the entire population of New Orleans, leaving the community and government with several economic and social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Oliver-Smith/ |title=Disasters and Forced Migration in the 21st Century |work=ssrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Environmental problems]]: The term [[environmental refugee]] has been in use recently representing people who are forced to leave their traditional habitat because of environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood, or even environmental disruption i.e. biological, physical or chemical change in ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, University de Liege, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Migration can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]], of deforestation or [[land degradation]]. Man-made disasters can also cause forced migration: examples are industrial accidents and especially accidents that involve radioactivity, such as in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. An elaboration of such migrants is given by Essam El-Hinnawi:
# Migrants who are able to return to their original habitat once the disruption is over, as in the case of the [[Bhopal disaster]].
# Migrants  who remain permanently displaced.
# Migrants  who seek better living conditions due to deterioration of environmental conditions in their present habitat, such as soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/show_metadata.jsp?pid=fmo:1158 |title=Environment and forced migration : a review   Paper for 4th IRAP conference 5–9 January 1994, Oxford |author=Forced Migration Online, Refugee Studies Centre, Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford |work=forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 19th century, for example, Ireland experienced a famine never before seen in the country’s history.
* [[War]], [[civil war]], [[political repression]] or [[Religious intolerance|religious conflict]]s: Some migrants are impelled to cross national borders by war or persecution, due to political, social, ethnic, religious reasons. These immigrants may be considered [[refugees]] if they apply for [[asylum seekers|asylum]] in the receiving country.&lt;ref&gt;Conventions No. 29, 105, 138 and 182; Convention No. 97 (Art. 3, Annex I; Art. 8 and Annex II, Art. 13); Convention No. 143, Part I; 1990 International Convention (Art. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Development-induced displacement]]: Such displacement or [[population transfer]] is the forcing of communities and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of [[economic development]]. It has been historically associated with the construction of dams for [[hydroelectric power]] and [[irrigation]] purposes but also appears due to many other activities, such as [[mining]] and transport (roads, ports, airports). The best-known recent example of such development-induced displacement may be that resulting from the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[China]]. This type of forced migration disproportionately affects low income earners and ethnic minorities. According to estimates, between 90 and 100 million people were forced to leave their homes due to development projects in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"/&gt;
* [[Human trafficking]] and [[human smuggling]]: Migrants displaced through deception or coercion with purpose of their exploitation fall under this category. The data on such forced migration are limited since the activities involved are clandestine in nature. While migration of this nature is well covered for male migrants (working in agriculture, construction etc.), same cannot be said for their female counterparts as the market situation for them might be unscrupulous (sex work or domestic service). The [[International Labour Organization]] considers trafficking an offence against labor protection and denies them the opportunity of utilizing their resources for their country. ILO’s Multilateral Framework includes principle no. 11 that recommends, "Governments should formulate and implement, in consultation with the social partners, measures to prevent abusive practices, migrant smuggling and people trafficking; they should also work towards preventing irregular labor migration.
* [[Slavery]]: History's greatest forced migration was the [[Middle Passage]] of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] during the 15th through the 19th centuries.  Of the 20 million Africans captured for the trade, half died in their forced march to the African coast, and another ten to twenty percent died on slave ships carrying them from Africa to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html |author=PBS-WGBH |title=The Middle Passage |work=Africans in America |date=1999 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethnic cleansing]]: The systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous.

==Conditions==

In the majority of cases forced migration across borders takes place without the required documentation. It may even involve human smugglers and traffickers. Displaced people often place their lives at risk, are obliged to travel in inhumane conditions and may be exposed to exploitation and abuse. And on top of that the states where they seek protection may regard them as a threat to their security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf | page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and distinctions between the terms==
{{see|Refugee law|Refugee}}
* The term 'Refugee Studies' denotes an academic discipline or field of study which covers the study of refugees, often their experiences in seeking refuge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Bobby Thomas|date=2014|title=Reflections on Refugee Studies and the Study of Refugees: Implications for Policy Analysts|url=https://bobbycameron.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/final_bobby-thomas-cameron_refugee-studies.pdf|journal=Journal of Management &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|pages=4–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several categories of individuals who are included in this study, with labels that include: 'Refugee’; ‘expellees’; ‘exile’; ‘displaced person’; ‘internally displaced person (IDP)’; ‘economic refugees’; ‘humanitarian refugee’; ‘stateless person’; ‘tsunami refugee’; ‘development refugee’; ‘environmental refugee’; ‘government assisted refugee (GAR)’ etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The term displaced person (DP) was first widely used during [[World War II]] and the resulting refugee outflows from [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wyman: ''Dps: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945–1951''. Cornell University Press 1998 (reprint). {{ISBN|0-8014-8542-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when it was used to specifically refer to one removed from his or her native country as a [[refugee]], [[prison]]er or a [[unfree labour|slave laborer]]. Most of the victims of war, political refugees and DPs of the immediate post-Second World War period were Ukrainians, Poles, other Slavs, as well as citizens of the Baltic states – Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians, who refused to return to Soviet-dominated eastern Europe. A.J. Jaffe claimed that the term was originally coined by [[Eugene M. Kulischer]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Jaffe: Notes on the Population Theory of Eugene M. Kulischer. In: ''The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly'', Vol. 40, No. 2. (April 1962). Pp. 187–206.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3348648 (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning has significantly broadened in the past half-century.

* If the displaced person has crossed an international border and falls under one of the [[Refugee Law|relevant international legal instruments]], they may become a [[refugee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm U.N. Convention relating to status of Refugees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309151637/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm |date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "refugee" is also commonly used as a synonym for displaced person, causing confusion between the general descriptive class of anyone who has left their home and the subgroup of legally defined [[refugee]]s who enjoy specified international legal protection. However, forced migrants may not apply for asylum in the country they fled to, so they may not be classed as [[asylum seeker]]s or – if application would be successful – [[refugee]]s. The terms refugee and asylum seeker always have a legal framework or system as context. If forced migrants do not access this legal system or it does not exist in the country they have fled to, they cannot be categorised as such.

* Forced migrants are always either IDPs or displaced people, as both of these terms do not require a legal framework and the fact that they left their homes is sufficient. The distinction between the terms displaced person and forced migrant is minor, however, the term displaced person has an important historic context (e.g. [[World War II]]).

* A displaced person who crosses an international border without permission from the country they are entering, and without applying for asylum, may be considered an [[illegal immigrant]].

* A displaced person who left his or her home because of political persecution or violence, but did not cross an international border, is commonly considered to be the less well-defined category of [[internally displaced person]] (IDP), and is subject to more tenuous international protection. Bogumil Terminski distinguishes two general categories of internal displacement: displacement of risk (mostly conflict-induced displacement, deportations and disaster-induced displacement) and displacement of adaptation (associated with voluntary resettlement, development-induced displacement and environmentally-induced displacement).

* If the displaced person was forced out their home because of economically driven projects like that of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China and various [[India]]n dams, it is called [[development-induced displacement]]. People are also often displaced due to [[natural disaster|natural]] or man-made disasters. Displacement can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]]. A person who is displaced due to environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood is generally known as an [[environmental migrant]]. Such displacement can be cross-border in nature but is frequently internal. No specific international legal instrument applies to such individuals. Foreign nations often offer disaster relief to mitigate the effects of such disaster displacement.

* Displaced person generally refers to one who is forced to migrate for reasons other than economic conditions, such as war or persecution. A migrant who fled because of economic hardship is an [[economic migrant]].

==Criminal prosecution==
Forced displacement has been subjected to several trials before local and international courts. One of the requirements that need to be met for an offence as a [[war crime]] is that the victim is a "protected person" under [[international humanitarian law]]. The expression "protected person" originally referred only to the categories of individuals explicitly protected under one of the four [[Geneva Conventions of 1949]], but was later accepted as defining a [[civilian]] or police force who do not participate directly in a conflict.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4e0344b344.pdf | title=Legal and Protection Policy Research Series: Forced Displacement and International Crimes |publisher=UNHCR| author=Guido Acquaviva |date=June 2011|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of [[World War II]], the [[Krupp trial]] was held with a specific charge to the forced displacement of civilian populations for the purpose of forced labour. The US Military Tribunal concluded that "
[t]here is no international law that permits the deportation or the use of civilians against their will for other than on reasonable requisitions for the need of the army, either within the area of the army or after deportation to rear areas or to the homeland of the occupying power".&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; At the [[Nuremberg trials]], [[Hans Frank]], chief jurist in [[occupied Poland]], was found guilty, among others for forced displacement of the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nuremberg-trial-judgements-hans-frank|title=Nuremberg Trial Judgements: Hans Frank|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Article 49, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], adopted on 12 August 1949, specifically forbids forced displacement:

{{quote3|Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected people from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600056 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] |title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949 – DEPORTATIONS, TRANSFERS, EVACUATIONS |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] defines forced displacement as a crime within the jurisdiction of the court:
{{quote3|"Deportation or forcible transfer of population" means forced displacement of the people concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf |publisher=International Criminal Court |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |year=2011 |p=7|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several people were tried and convicted by the [[ICTY]] for connection to forced displacement during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber sentenced [[Vojislav Šešelj]] 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating [[deportation]], [[persecution]] (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as [[crimes against humanity]] due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the [[expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmict.org/en/news/appeals-chamber-reverses-%C5%A1e%C5%A1elj%E2%80%99s-acquittal-part-and-convicts-him-crimes-against-humanity|title=APPEALS CHAMBER REVERSES ŠEŠELJ’S ACQUITTAL, IN PART, AND CONVICTS HIM OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY| date=11 April 2018| publisher=United Nations Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/europe/un-court-sentences-ultranationalist-serb-leader-to-10-years-16638|title=UN court sentences ultranationalist Serb leader to 10 years |publisher=[[TRT World]] |accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/serbia-conviction-of-war-criminal-delivers-long-overdue-justice-to-victims/|title=Serbia: Conviction of war criminal delivers long overdue justice to victims| publisher=Amnesty International| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other convictions for forced displacement included ex-Bosnian Serb politician [[Momčilo Krajišnik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal transfers former Bosnian Serb leader to UK prison |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2009/09/311692-un-tribunal-transfers-former-bosnian-serb-leader-uk-prison| date=8 September 2009|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ex-Croatian Serb leader [[Milan Martić]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal upholds 35-year jail term for leader of breakaway Croatian Serb state|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/10/277112-un-tribunal-upholds-35-year-jail-term-leader-breakaway-croatian-serb-state|date=8 October 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander [[Mladen Naletilić]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Croat commander convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Italy |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/04/257282-bosnian-croat-commander-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-italy| date=25 April 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bosnian Serb politician [[Radoslav Brđanin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Serb politician convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Denmark |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/03/251232-bosnian-serb-politician-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-denmark |date=4 March 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of [[English language]] descends from Old English, the language brought with the Angles, Saxon, and Jutish settlers to what was to be called England in and after the 500s. The bulk of the language in spoken and written texts is from this source. As a statistical rule, around 70 percent of words in any text are Anglo-Saxon. Moreover, the grammar is largely Anglo-Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, Barbara 1998. ''A history of English. A sociolinguistic approach''. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant portion of the English vocabulary comes from [[Romance languages|Romance]] and Latinate sources. Estimates of native words (derived from [[Old English language|Old English]]) range from 20%&amp;ndash;33%, with the rest made up of outside borrowings. A portion of these borrowings come directly from [[Latin]], or through one of the Romance languages, particularly [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[French language|French]], but some also from [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; or from other languages (such as [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Frankish|Frankish]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Latin and then into English. The influence of Latin in English, therefore, is primarily lexical in nature, being confined mainly to words derived from Latin roots.&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter, ''Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue'', 2008, pp. 89–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some new words enter English as slang, most do not. Some words are adopted from other languages; some are mixtures of existing words ([[portmanteau]] words), and some are new creations made of roots from [[Extinct language|dead languages]]: e.g., [[thanatopsis]].

==Word origins==
A computerized survey of about 80,000 words in the old ''[[Shorter Oxford Dictionary]]'' (3rd ed.) was published in ''Ordered Profusion'' by Thomas Finkenstaedt and Dieter Wolff (1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finkenstaedt |first=Thomas |author2=Dieter Wolff  |title=Ordered profusion; studies in dictionaries and the English lexicon |publisher=C. Winter |year=1973 |isbn=3-533-02253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that estimated the origin of English words as follows:

* French: [[List of English words of French origin|28.3%]]
* Latin, including modern scientific and technical Latin: [[List of Latin words with English derivatives|28.24%]]
* [[Germanic languages]] – inherited from [[Old English]], from Proto-Germanic, or a more recent borrowing from a Germanic language such as [[Old Norse]]; does not include [[List of English Latinates of Germanic origin|Germanic words borrowed from a Romance language]], i.e., coming from the Germanic element in French, Latin or other Romance languages: 25%
* Greek: 5.32%
* No etymology given: 4.04%
* Derived from proper names: 3.28%
* All other languages: less than 1%

A survey by [[Joseph M. Williams]] in ''Origins of the English Language'' of 10,000 words taken from several thousand business letters gave this set of statistics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0029344700 |title=Joseph M.

==Languages influencing the English language==
{{Expand section|date=May 2017}}
Here is a list of the most common foreign language influences in English, where other languages have influenced or contributed words to English.

===[[Celtic languages|Celtic]]===
{{Main|Lists of English words of Celtic origin}}
Words are almost absent, except for dialectal words, such as the [[Yan Tan Tethera]] system of counting sheep. However, hypotheses have been made that English syntax was influenced by Celtic languages, such as the system of [[Continuous and progressive aspects|continuous tenses]] was a cliché of similar Celtic phrasal structures; this is controversial, as the system has clear native English and other Germanic developments.

===[[French language|French]]===
{{Main|English words of French origin}}
The French contributed legal, military, technological, and political terminology. Their language also contributed common words, such as the names of meats: ''veal'', ''mutton'', ''beef'', ''pork'', and how food was prepared: ''boil'', ''broil'', ''fry'', ''roast'', and ''stew''; as well as words related to the nobility: ''prince'', ''duke'', ''marquess'', ''viscount'', ''baron'', and their feminine equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Algeo|first1=John|title=The Origins and Development of the English Language|date=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=1-4282-3145-5|edition=6th|url=http://www.kaa.ff.ukf.sk/attachments/article/39/The%20Origins%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20English%20Language%20(Textbook).pdf|accessdate=8 June 2017|format=PDF}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|254-258}} Nearly 40 percent of English words (in an 80,000 word dictionary) may be of French origin.

===[[Latin]]===
{{Main|Latin influence in English}}
Scientific and technical words, [[medical terminology]], academic and legal terminology.

===[[Greek language|Greek]]===
{{See also|English words of Greek origin|List of Greek morphemes used in English}}
Scientific and medical terminology (for instance [[wiktionary:-phobia|-phobia]]s and [[wiktionary:-logy|-ologies]]), Christian theological terminology.

===[[Norman language|Norman]]===
''Castle'', ''cauldron'', ''kennel'', ''catch'', ''cater'' are among Norman words introduced into English. The Norman language also introduced (or reinforced) words of Norse origin such as ''mug''.

===[[Dutch language|Dutch]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Dutch origin|List of place names of Dutch origin|Dutch linguistic influence on naval terms|List of English words of Afrikaans origin}}
There are many ways through which Dutch words have entered the English language: via trade and navigation, such as ''[[Penus (boating)|skipper]]'' (from ''schipper''), ''[[freebooter (disambiguation)|freebooter]]'' (from ''vrijbuiter''), ''[[keelhauling]]'' (from ''kielhalen''); via painting, such as ''[[landscape]]'' (from ''landschap''), ''[[easel]]'' (from ''ezel''), ''[[still life]]'' (from ''stilleven''); warfare, such as ''[[forlorn hope]] (from ''verloren hoop''), ''beleaguer (from ''beleger''), ''to bicker'' (from ''bicken''); via civil engineering, such as ''[[dam]]'', ''[[polder]]'', ''[[dune]]'' (from ''duin''); via the [[New Netherland]] settlements in North America, such as  ''[[cookie]]'' (from ''koekie''), ''[[wikt:boss|boss]]'' from ''baas'', ''[[Santa Claus]]'' (from ''[[Sinterklaas]]''); via Dutch/[[Afrikaans]] speakers with English speakers in [[South Africa]], such as ''[[wildebeest]]'', ''[[apartheid]]'', ''[[boer]]''; via French words of Dutch/Flemish origin that have subsequently been adopted into English, such as ''[[boulevard]]'' (from ''bolwerk''), ''[[mannequin]]'' (from ''manneken''), ''[[buoy]]'' (from ''boei'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Joseph M|title=Origins of the English Language|date=1986|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0029344700|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Origins_of_the_English_Language.html?id=RamwAZ6fpaoC|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Spanish language|Spanish]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Spanish origin}}
Words relating to warfare and tactics, for instance ''[[flotilla]]'' and ''[[guerrilla]]''; or related to science and culture, whether created in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], originated in [[Amerindian]] civilizations ([[Cariban languages|Cariban]]: ''[[cannibal]]'', ''hurricane''; [[Mescalero language|Mescalero]]: ''[[apache]]''; [[Nahuatl]]: ''[[tomato]]'', ''[[coyote]]'', ''[[chocolate]]''; [[Quechua language|Quechua]]: ''[[potato]]''; [[Taíno language|Taíno]]: ''[[tobacco]]''), or [[Iberian Romance languages]] (''aficionado'', ''[[albino]]'', ''[[alligator]]'', ''[[cargo]]'', ''[[cigar]]'', ''[[embargo]]'', ''[[guitar]]'', ''[[jade]]'', ''[[mesa]]'', ''[[paella]]'', ''[[platinum]]'', ''[[plaza]]'', ''[[wikt:renegade|renegade]]'', ''[[rodeo]]'', ''[[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]]'', ''savvy'', ''[[wikt:sierra|sierra]]'', ''[[siesta]]'', ''[[tilde]]'', ''[[tornado]]'', ''[[vanilla]]'' etc.).

===[[Italian language|Italian]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Italian origin}}
Words relating to some music, [[piano]], ''fortissimo''. Or Italian culture, such as ''piazza'', ''pizza'', ''gondola'', ''balcony'', ''[[fascism]]''. The English word ''[[umbrella]]'' comes from Italian ''ombrello''.

===[[Languages of India|Indian Languages]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Hindi origin}}
Words relating to culture, originating from the colonial era. Many of these words are of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin rather than [[Hindi]] because Persian was the official language of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] courts. e.g., ''pyjamas'', ''bungalow'', ''verandah'', ''jungle'', ''curry'', ''shampoo'', ''khaki''.

===[[German language|German]]===
{{See also|List of German expressions in English}}
German words relating to [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] found their way into the English language, words such as ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'', ''[[Führer]]'' and ''[[Lebensraum]]''; food terms, such as ''[[bratwurst]]'', ''[[hamburger]]'' and ''[[Sausage|frankfurter]]''; words related to psychology and philosophy, such a ''[[gestalt psychology|gestalt]]'', ''[[Übermensch]]'', ''[[zeitgeist]]'' and ''[[realpolitik]]''. From German origin are also: ''wanderlust'', ''schadenfreude'', ''kaputt'', ''kindergarten'', ''autobahn'', ''rucksack''.

===[[Old Norse]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Old Norse origin}}
Words of [[Old Norse]] origin have entered English primarily from the contact between Old Norse and [[Old English]] during colonisation of eastern and northern [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] between the mid 9th to the 11th centuries (see also [[Danelaw]]). Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as ''egg'', ''sky'' or ''knife''.

===[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]===
Words used in religious contexts, like [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabath]], [[kosher]], [[hallelujah]], [[amen]], and [[jubilee (Biblical)|jubilee]] or words that have become slang like ''[[Schmuck (pejorative)|schmuck]]'', ''shmooze'', ''nosh'', ''[[oy vey]]'', and ''[[wikt:Schmutz|schmutz]]''.

===[[Arabic language|Arabic]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Arabic origin}}
Trade items such as ''borax'', ''coffee'', ''cotton'', ''hashish'', ''henna'', ''mohair'', ''muslin'', ''saffron''; [[Islam]]ic religious terms such as ''jihad'', ''hadith'' and ''sharia''; scientific vocabulary borrowed into Latin in the 12th and 13th centuries (''alcohol'', ''alkali'', ''algebra'', ''azimuth'', ''cipher'', ''nadir''); plants or plant products originating in tropical Asia and introduced to medieval Europe through Arabic intermediation (''camphor'', ''jasmine'', ''lacquer'', ''lemon'', ''orange'', ''sugar''); Middle Eastern cuisine words (''couscous'', ''falafel'', ''hummus'', ''kebab'', ''tahini'').

==Counting==
Cardinal numbering in English follows two models, Germanic and Italic. The basic numbers are zero through ten. The numbers eleven through nineteen follow native Germanic style, as do twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety.

Standard English, especially in very conservative formal contexts, continued to use native Germanic style as late as World War I for intermediate numbers greater than 20, viz., "one-and-twenty," "five-and-thirty," "seven-and-ninety," and so. But with the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the Latin tradition of counting as "twenty-one," "thirty-five," "ninety-seven," etc., which is easier to say and was already common in non-standard regional dialects, gradually replaced the traditional Germanic style to become the dominant style by the end of nineteenth century.

== Opposition ==
{{main|Linguistic purism in English}}
Linguistic purism in the English language is the belief that words of native origin should be used instead of foreign-derived ones (which are mainly Romantic, Latin and Greek). "Native" can mean "Anglo-Saxon" or it can be widened to include all Germanic words. In its mild form, it merely means using existing native words instead of foreign-derived ones (such as using "begin" instead of "commence"). In its more extreme form, it involves reviving native words that are no longer widely used (such as "ettle" for "intend") and/or coining new words from Germanic roots (such as word stock for vocabulary). This dates at least to the [[inkhorn term]] debate of the 16th and 17th century, where some authors rejected the foreign influence, and has continued to this day, being most prominent in [[Plain English]] advocacy to avoid Latinate terms if a simple native alternative exists.

[[Image:Four continents.png|thumb|The classical four continents]]

Europeans in the 16th century divided the world into '''four continents''': [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nothing was known of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], first sighted in the early seventeenth century, or  [[Antarctica]], first sighted in the nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the four [[continents]] was seen to represent its quadrant of the world&amp;mdash;Europe in the north, Asia in the east, Africa in the south, and America in the west. This division fit the [[Renaissance]] sensibilities of the time, which also divided the world into four [[season]]s, four [[classical element]]s, four [[cardinal directions]], four classical [[virtues]], etc.

The '''four parts of the world'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ciappara|first=Frans|date=1998|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/4672/1/4672_2141.PDF?UkUDh:CyT|title=Society and inquisition in Malta 1743-1798|publisher=Durhem E-Theses|location=[[Durham University]]|page=38|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''four corners of the world''' refers to the [[Americas]] (the "west"), [[Europe]] (the "north"), [[Asia]] (the "east"), and [[Africa]] (the "south"). 

==A three-cornered world==
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|The ancient tripartite view of the world]]
Before the discovery of the [[New World]] a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the "three parts" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa. As [[Laurent de Premierfait]], the pre-eminent French translator of Latin literature in the early fifteenth century, informed his readers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Asia is one of the three parts of the world, which the authors divide in Asia, Africa and Europe. Asia extends towards the [[Orient]] as far as the rising sun (''"devers le [[Levant|souleil levant]]"''&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt;), towards the south ("midi") it ends at the great sea, towards the occident it ends at [[Mare Nostrum|our sea]], and towards the north ("[[septentrional|septentrion]]") it ends in the [[Maeotian marshes]] and the river named ''[[Tanais|Thanaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Asie est l'une des trois parties du monde que les auteurs divisent en Asie, Afrique et Europe. Asie se extend devers orient jusques a souleil&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt; [[levant]], devers midi elle fine a la grant mer devers occident elle fine a notre mer, et devers septentrion elle fine aux paluz Meotides et au fleuve appellé Thanaus''; Laurent de Premierfait's expanded translation of [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' (1409), quoted in Patricia M. Gathercole, "Laurent de Premierfait: The Translator of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium" ''The French Review'' '''27'''.4 (February 1954:245-252) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:EuropaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''Europa:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

==A fourth corner: the enlarged world==
For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at "our sea", the [[Mediterranean]]; Europeans were only dimly aware of the [[Ural Mountains]], which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or [[craton]]s. Instead, the division between these continents in the European-centered picture was the [[Hellespont]], which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the [[Age of Discovery]], Asia began beyond the Hellespont with [[Asia Minor]], where the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] had lain, and stretched away to unimaginably exotic and distant places&amp;mdash; "the [[Orient]]".

In the sixteenth century [[Americas|America]] too was full of exotic promise: the "[[New World]]".&lt;ref&gt;This theme is extensively explored in Hugh Honour, ''The New Golden Land: European Images of America from the Discoveries to the Present'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[Cesare Ripa]] published a book of emblems for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times. It was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century. The illustrations reveal fixed Eurocentric perceptions of the nature of the "four corners of the world." Ripa's ''Europe'' (''illustration, left'') is the land of abundance (cornucopia) of kings and the pope, whose crowns and the papal tiara lie at her feet, and of cities.
[[Image:AsiaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Asia:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia,'' 1603]]
''Africa'', by contrast (''illustration, below right'') wears the elephant headdress (worn by rulers depicted on Hellenistic [[Bactria]]n coins) and is accompanied by a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands and [[Cleopatra]]'s [[asp (reptile)|asps]]. ''Asia'' (''illustration, right''), the seat of Religion, carries a smoking [[censer]] as a camel takes its ease.
[[Image:AmericaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''America'', woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]
And the iconic image of ''America'' (''illustration, below left'') shows a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] maiden in a feathered headdress, with [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled [[Amazons|Amazon]] from the river that already carried the name.

The American millionaire philanthropist [[James Hazen Hyde]], who inherited a majority share in [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], formed a collection of allegorical prints illustrating the Four Continents that are now at the [[New-York Historical Society]]; Hyde's drawings and a supporting collection of sets of porcelain table ornaments and other decorative arts illustrating the Four Continents were shared by various [[New York City]] museums.
[[Image:AfricaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Africa'': woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

The Renaissance associated one major river to each of the continents.
The Four Rivers theme appears for example in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] in the [[Piazza Navona]] in Rome.

With the confirmed discovery that [[Australia]] was an island continent, the theme of the "Four Continents" lost much of its drive, long before a sixth continent, [[Antarctica]], was discovered. The iconography survived as the '''Four Corners of the World''', however, generally in self-consciously classicizing contexts: for instance, in New York, in front of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] (1907), four sculptural groups by [[Daniel Chester French]] symbolize the "Four Corners of the World."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6181">The term '''G-Zero world''' refers to an emerging [[Power vacuum|vacuum of power]] in [[international politics]] created by a decline of [[Western world|Western]] influence and the domestic focus of the governments of developing states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks Eurasia Group Top 10 Risks of 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131233850/http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks |date=2011-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/g-zero/ G-Zero], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to explain a world in which there is no single country or group of countries that has ability and will, economically and politically, to drive a truly global agenda. 

The term G-Zero was first coined by political scientists [[Ian Bremmer]] and [[David F. Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Racanelli, Vito. [http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2011/01/26/davos-who-or-what-is-g-zero/ Davos: Who or What is G-Zero?], ''Barron’s'', January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/01/28/132742511/the-friday-podcast-g-zero The Friday Podcast: G-Zero]. NPR ''Planet Money'', January 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; G-Zero became the main theme of [[Ian Bremmer|Ian Bremmer's]] book, ''[[Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World]]'' ([[Penguin Group|Portfolio]], May 2012).  

It is a reference to a perceived shift away from the preeminence of the [[G7|Group of Seven]] industrialized countries and the expanded [[G20|Group of Twenty]], which includes major emerging powers like [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], [[Turkey]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, Damian. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/damianreece/8284541/Davos-WEF-2011-East-and-West-must-cooperate-if-were-to-survive-this-economic-mess.html Davos WEF 2011: East and West must cooperate if we’re to survive this economic mess], ''The Telegraph'', January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Reece, Damian, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/8332545/G20-Paris-Sarkozy-dares-to-dream-in-a-G-Zero-world.html G20 Paris: Sarkozy Dares to Dream in a G-Zero World] ''The Telegraph'', February 18, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Parag and Leonard, Mark [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/opinion/08iht-edkhanna08.html Why China wants a G-3 World] ''The International Herald Tribune'', September 8, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; It is also a rejection of terms like [[Group of Two|G2]], often used to identify a possible strategic partnership between the U.S. and Chinese governments, or G3, which represents an attempt to align U.S., European and Japanese interests to defend [[free market democracy]] from the rise of [[State capitalism#People.27s_Republic_of_China|Chinese-inspired state-dominated capitalism]].

Those who argue that the G-Zero has become the current international order warn that the [[G7]] has become obsolete, that the [[G20]] offers too many competing visions of the proper role of government in an economy to produce well-coordinated policies, that China has no interest in the responsibilities that come with a [[Group of Two|G2]], and that America, Europe and Japan are too mired in internal problems to forge a common approach to economic and security policy. 

In an article called “From G8 to G20 to G-Zero: Why no one wants to take charge in the new global order," Ian Bremmer writes that making compromises are difficult since each country has their own values and developed countries have voters that want their leader's focus to be domestic community, not the international one. Some of these developed countries include: the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Japan. As developed countries start to focus on their domestic issues, the lack of global leadership increases which in turn increases the transnational problems. As global leadership decreases, clashes between countries are also increasing such as America and China having different views on “statedriven and free-market varieties of capitalism”. There are also issues arising in East Asia between nations such as China and Japan in the East China Sea. The U.S. has to also focus on changes in their energy sector and whether they should participate in Syria’s civil war.

Bremmer explains that governments can adapt to the G-Zero through focusing on regional solutions such as China’s deals with the [[Association of South-East Asian Nations]] (A.S.E.A.N.) and the United States’ progress on the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]]. Governments can also form relationships with a diversity of partners. However some countries may still not be able to adapt to the G-0 because of three impacting events in the world: "China's rise, Middle East turmoil and the redesign of Europe". Countries affected by these events would be Japan, Israel and Britain. &lt;ref&gt; Ian Bremmer, [http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2013/06/g8-g20-g-zero-why-no-one-wants-take-charge-new-global-order "From G8 to G20 to G-Zero: Why no one wants to take charge in the new global order"], ''Newstatesman'', June 11, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the G-Zero has been criticized by some who argue that it overstates the decline in America’s [[political power|political]] and [[economic power]] and underestimates the willingness of [[developing countries]] to play a larger role on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/02/28/g-zero-gee-another-idea-with-zero-to-support-it/&lt;/ref&gt;

GMA Pinoy TV was first launched in Japan on March 2005. It was later launched in several parts of the United States in the same year, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and the states of the East Coast. The official GMA Pinoy TV launch in America happened in San Francisco on 23 July 2005 and was aired on ''[[SOP (Philippine TV series)|SOP]]'' the following Sunday, 31 July 2005.

The logo also was seen in the upper right and left corners at varied times. It was settled in 2007 that the logo will be seen in the upper right corner.  In 2007, GMA Pinoy TV became a huge success and was known better known because of ''[[MariMar (2007 TV series)|Marimar]]''. Due to the success of the program, GMA Pinoy TV once changed graphics, which has been used from 2007 to October 2010.

An associated second channel, [[GMA Life TV]], was successfully launched in March 2008 and soon grew to 109,000 subscribers. GMA Pinoy TV had 225,000 subscribers as of September 2009. The percent of subscribers has gone up 34% according to [[GMA New Media]], Inc.

The said election coverage was aired live on GMA Pinoy TV on 9 May until the Election ended. Based on the September 2010 report posted by the Corporate Communications Department of GMA Network, GMA Pinoy TV had a total of 256,000 subscribers while its sister channel, GMA Life TV had 122,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/6812/GMA-Pinoy-TV-and-GMA-Life-TV-initiate-projects-that-will-enrich-lives-of-Filipinos-abroad|title=GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV initiate projects that will enrich lives of Filipinos abroad - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=16 September 2010|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 2010 (otherwise known was 10-10-10), GMA Pinoy TV changed graphics with a theme that recognizes and is towards Pinoys all over the world. It also has a globe symbolizing how far GMA Pinoy TV has gone since the start. On Christmas 2010, GMA Pinoy TV used the slogan "Isang Maligayang at Masaganang Paskong Pinoy, Kapuso." This was the first time that GMA Pinoy TV used another Christmas slogan besides the GMA Network Christmas 2010 slogan, "Isang Pagkilala sa Puso ng Pilipino Ngayong Pasko." As for the 3rd Quarter of 2010, GMA Pinoy TV had around 261,000 subscribers posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7457/gma-pinoy-tv-and-gma-life-tv-launches-10-new-locations-in-december-2010|title=GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV launches 10 new locations in December 2010 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=12 January 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV has expanded into the following: Chicago, Illinois (via Comcast Chicago); New York (via Time Warner New York); Washington, D.C., Maryland, Alabama, Virginia (via Comcast); Vancouver, British Columbia (via Telus Canada); and Italy, London, and the rest of UK and rest of Europe (via Infinity IPTV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pinoytvshows.mobi|title=GMANetwork.com - Pinoy TV|first=GMA New Media,|last=Inc.|date=|website=GMA Pinoy TV|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report published showing GMA Network's revenues for 2010 with a total of PhP 14.299 billion, GMA Life TV has 125,000 subscribers (an estimated 800,000 viewers count) while GMA Pinoy TV has an accounted 274,000 subscribers (around 1.8 million viewers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7798/gma-7-ends-2010-with-revenues-of-p14299-billion39-closes-february-with-342-points-vs-abs-cbn39s-32--points-in-nutam-ratings|title=GMA-7 ends 2010 with ”revenues of P14.299 billion'; closes February with 34.2 points vs ABS-CBN's 32  points in NUTAM ratings - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=11 March 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GMA Pinoy TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pinoytvshows.mobi/category/gma-tv-shows/|title=Pinoy TV GMA Shows|work=Pinoy GMA TV Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the delays of the shows on GMA Pinoy TV receded from months of delay to two days delay for primetime shows and three days delay for afternoon dramas. On the first quarter of 2011, GMA Pinoy TV and its home network in the Philippines revealed a new logo with minor changes. The "GMA" letters part is seen to be more embossed and the logo has a "glow" effect. On 28 February 2011 for the first time in GMA International's history, two programs that started airing on GMA Pinoy TV that were still running with new episodes were switched over to [[GMA Life TV]], where it will then air its new episodes to occupy free time slots. This then led to replays of other Kapuso shows. The shows included ''Pinoy MD'' and ''[[Love ni Mister, Love ni Misis]]''. All this will be straightened out once [[GMA News TV]] starts its [[GMA News TV International|international operations]] sometime 2nd to 3rd quarter of 2011.

On 10 March 2011 GMA Pinoy TV and [[GMA Life TV]] expanded even more in the United States in Florida. The Florida counties that are part of the extension include Brevard, Flagler, Lake, Marion, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Sumter and Volusia. On 5 April 2011, though already launched in the Philippines on 27 March 2011, GMA Pinoy TV officially launched the 2011 summer slogan of GMA "Halo-Halo Ang Summer Saya". This took some time to launch on GMA Pinoy TV because significant edits were made in which some of the programs on the original version were not slated to air on GMA Pinoy TV like ''Man vs. Beast'' but beside that, the international version of the station ID still included planned shows of Summer 2011. Also in April 2011, GMA Pinoy TV is now being broadcast by COX Communications in Arizona, areas like Tucson and Arizona, on Channel 482.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pinoytvshows.mobi/category/abs-cbn-tv-shows/|title=ABS GMA Shows|work=GMA ABS TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report dated 16 May 2011 regarding the consolidated gross revenues of GMA Network, Inc. in the 1st quarter of 2011, it is noted that GMA Pinoy TV's subscriptions grew by 10 percent (approximately 300,000 subscribers) and GMA Life TV's subscriptions grew by 2 percent (approximately 128,000). This consisted of PhP 230 million worth of advertising and subscription revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pinoytvshows.mobi/a-love-so-beautiful-april-24-2018-full-hd-watch-video/|title=Famous HD TV Show of GMA Network|work=GMA Network HD TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another recent report with regards to GMA Network's consolidated revenues in the 2nd quarter of 2011, GMA Pinoy TV's subscribers grew to 279,000 from 274,000 (actual count) and an estimated number of 1.85 million viewers and GMA Life TV's subscribers grew as well, an estimated 1 million viewers. Also, GMA Network recently launched GMA News TV in the past month and will be made available to all areas where GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV reaches by 3rd Quarter of 2011. GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV were further made to subscribers in key Filipino-American areas in the US, namely New Jersey, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and Washington D.C.  They were also launched in many parts of Detroit, Hawaii and upstate New York and New England. The channels were also launched by additional carriers in Australia and Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/8621/gma-network-consolidated-revenues-in-q2-soar-14-percent-to-p3587-billion-versus-q1|title=GMA Network consolidated revenues in Q2 soar 14 percent to P3.587 billion versus Q1 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=3 August 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2011, GMA Pinoy TV accepted two awards from the National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications (NAMIC) in New York for 2011 Excellence in Multicultural Marketing Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/at-a-glance/8969/gma-pinoy-tv-earned-two-awards-in-the-2011-excellence-in-multicultural-marketing-awards|title=GMA Pinoy TV earned two awards in the 2011 Excellence in Multicultural Marketing Awards - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=20 September 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2011, GMA Pinoy TV launched GMA's 2011 Christmas Station ID in several parts with each cast of most Kapuso shows and it was usually during the show and one right after the show ended. On 24 November 2011, Thanksgiving Day in the US, GMA Pinoy TV launched the Christmas-themed graphics for 2011, which also included the upper-right logo being converted to a Christmas-themed one. This was also the same date that GMA Network revamped its websites, with new features and a new look.
On December 2011, GMA Pinoy TV’s subscriber count closed at 291,309, a 7% increase over the 2010 closing subscriber number of 273,317. Because of this, revenues grew by 8% year-on-year and are expected to grow at that rate 2012 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=53472|title=BusinessWorld - Pinoy TV goes international|work=bworldonline.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221533/http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=53472|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2012, ''[[My Beloved (TV series)|My Beloved]]'' became is the first primetime TV Drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV. On 15 March 2012, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-screen graphics, replacing the 2010 version of approximately 30 seconds to one that is approximately 15 seconds.

In a press statement released by GMA Network, Inc., it was stated that GMA Pinoy TV, as of 1st Quarter of 2012, has approximately 303,000 subscribers, which numbers nearly 2 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=807032&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=66|title=Showbiz - Page not found - philstar.com|work=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pep.ph/guide/tv/10279/gma-7-profits-p388-million-during-1st-quarter-of-2012/1/2 |title=GMA-7 profits P388 million during 1st quarter of 2012 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz |author=PEP.ph |date=16 May 2012 |work=pep.ph |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145500/http://pep.ph/guide/tv/10279/gma-7-profits-p388-million-during-1st-quarter-of-2012/1/2 |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/359737/gma-network-earns-p388m-in-first-quarter-sees-rebound-later&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2012, GMA Pinoy TV released on-air alternate versions of its "Up Next" and "You're Watching" bumpers; they were much shorter and instead of clips of the shows, they featured the stars of the respective shows. On 5 June 2012, GMA Pinoy TV began experiencing audio issues with its broadcast, audio that is not so typical of High-Definition, High-Resolution cameras tha GMA uses. On 21 June 2012, the issue was resolved and the original audio type was restored. For the first time in GMA history, ''Idol sa Kusina'', a program originally aired on QTV then [[GMA News TV]] and [[simulcast]] on GMA Life TV moved to GMA Pinoy TV on 14 July 2012. In September 2012, for the first time in GMA Pinoy TV's history, ''[[24 Oras]]'', the network's flagship newscast program will had a four-hour-delayed telecast, meaning in the US, the show aired 7:30am (US-PST), 10:30am (US-EST), and 4:30am (Hawaii). This is the first time the network has placed ''24 Oras'' right after ''Unang Hirit'', which also changed timeslots to give way for 24 Oras.

As of 30 October 2012, four drama series were premiered that were one-day delayed: ''[[My Beloved (TV series)|My Beloved]]'', ''[[One True Love (TV series)|One True Love]]'', ''[[Coffee Prince (2012 TV series)|Coffee Prince]]'', and ''[[Temptation of Wife (2012 TV series)|Temptation of Wife]]''. This is part of GMA Pinoy TV's promise to its viewers to lessen airing delays and more original programming being shown. On 30 November 2012, GMA Pinoy TV updated its upper-right corner logo once more to a Christmas-themed one and one that celebrates GMA Pinoy TV's 7th anniversary and the version of the letters "GMA" are the more current one used by GMA. The on-air Christmas graphics which has been annually seen on GMA Pinoy TV was subsequently launched on 1 December 2012 and will last until the first week of January 2013. On 31 December 2012, GMA Pinoy TV aired ''Win na Win sa 2013: The GMA New Year Countdown'' live, making it the third time that GMA aired its New Year countdown live worldwide (previously in 2008 and 2011).

On 2013, ''[[Indio (TV series)|Indio]]'' and ''[[Mundo Mo'y Akin]]'' became the fifth and sixth TV Drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV. This makes all the current and future primetime dramas of GMA to air on a one-day episode delay basis, compared to previously where it started first as long as three-weeks delay to as short as two-days delay. For the first time on GMA Pinoy TV, copyrighted material created and produced by another company, [[National Geographic Channel]], was aired on GMA Pinoy TV on 7 April 2013. The copyrighted material aired under license is the National Geographic Channel Documentary entitled ''Inside Malacanang Palace'', which aired on March 2012, is a special documentary that takes the audience to an exclusive guided tour of the Malacanang Palace of the Philippines.

On the first quarter of 2013, GMA Pinoy TV had a total of 333,000 subscribers while its sister channel, GMA Life TV had 125,000 subscribers. This is based on a report that the Corporate Communications Department of GMA Network has posted. Overall, in 2012 and Q1 of 2013, subscription to GMA International channels increased by 7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/11900/gma-network-reports-p603-million-net-income-in-q1-2013|title=GMA Network reports P603 million net income in Q1 2013 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=15 May 2013|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2013, SingTel relaunched this channel together with [[GMA Life TV]] and in the new Fiesta Pack as well after 2 months of hiatus of this channel.

''[[Anna Karenina (2013 TV series)|Anna Karenina]]'' and ''[[My Husband's Lover]]'' became the seventh and eighth primetime TV drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere. On 27 August 2013, ''[[Pyra: Ang Babaeng Apoy]]'' started airing and was the first GMA Afternoon Prime drama series to be on only a one-episode delay basis, as for previous years, GMA Afternoon Prime dramas have been noted to be two to even four episodes delayed. On 10 September 2013, ''[[Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas]]'' became the ninth primetime TV drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV.

On 17 September 2013, GMA Pinoy TV had experienced technical problems and thus a three-hour delay was caused in its programming schedule, which received negative feedback from the viewers as they were not warned beforehand. The management had appealed to the viewers by saying that such was not intentional and was accidental because of technical/conversion issues. The following day, 18 September 2013, the programming staff of GMA Pinoy TV was prompted to change the programming schedule, effectively removing the airings of [[Eat Bulaga!]] and [[24 Oras]] just a few hours after its original broadcast. Viewers are still hoping for the programming of GMA Pinoy TV to revert to its original state, which most viewers preferred.

On 29 September 2013, a fire hit the basement of GMA Network's Building. The fire was put out in less than 50 minutes as the fire correspondents responded immediately. The fire affected the power supply of GMA Network and thus further affected the normal operations of GMA Network, including the operations of GMA Pinoy TV as well as GMA Life TV and GMA News TV International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/328695/news/metromanila/fire-hits-basement-of-gma-building|title=Fire hits basement of GMA building|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/497645/fire-hits-basement-of-gma-network-center|title=Fire hits basement of GMA Network Center|work=inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fire, temporary programming was aired consisting of replays of shows from the weekend. The fire had caused disappointment and inconvenience on the part of the viewers/subscribers. However, the management of GMA International assured its subscribers that indeed the appropriate measures are being taken and that normal operations are hoped to be restored at the soonest possible time. On 1 October 2013, programming had slowly been restored. Subscribers reported ''[[Unang Hirit]]'', ''[[24 Oras]]'', ''[[The Ryzza Mae Show]]'' and ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' among others to be updated and though slightly off their appropriate timeslot, still was managed to be aired over on GMA Pinoy TV. Also, ''[[My Husband's Lover]]'' aired back-to-back episodes and thus only on 1 October did it become the first TV series of GMA Drama to air the same episode that aired in the Philippines on the same day that it aired on GMA Pinoy TV. ''[[Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas]]'' and ''[[Kahit Nasaan Ka Man]]'' followed and also had back-to-back episodes aired; these "back-to-back" episode appeared to the viewers as hints that the primetime dramas will begin to air on same-day episode basis. However, this idea was dismissed on 2 October 2013 when these shows had re-aired the "catch up" episodes and thus, the primetime dramas were confirmed to be on a one-episode delay basis again. The network's afternoon dramas, ''[[Prinsesa ng Buhay Ko]]'', ''[[Magkano Ba ang Pag-ibig?]]'' and ''[[Pyra: Ang Babaeng Apoy]]'', are still airing on a one-episode delay basis and were not affected by the "catching up" that happened on 1 October. The only afternoon drama left airing on a two-episode delay basis is ''[[Mga Basang Sisiw]]''.

On 5 October 2013, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-air title screen, in celebration of its "8 Years of Bringing Global Pinoys Closer to Home." On 30 November 2013, GMA Pinoy TV updated its upper-right logo to a Christmas-themed one, alongside GMA's Christmas Theme for 2013, "Sundan Natin ang Bituin Pabalik sa Kanyang Piling". The following day, 1 December 2013, the on-air title screen and graphics were updated.

On 17 December 2013, ''[[The Ryzza Mae Show]]'' and ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' were restored to their late night timeslots in the North American feed. It was noted that subscribers continually pleaded GMA Pinoy TV to restore these shows to their late night timeslots as this is convenient for many working subscribers who are only able to watch at that time. After three months and a day of requests, the management finally granted such and the shows were restored to their respective and consecutive late night timeslots. In addition to their restored timeslots, the two shows air as well right after their restored timeslots and so, overall, ''The Ryzza Mae Show'' and ''Eat Bulaga'' air four times on GMA Pinoy TV daily. The New Year Countdown aired on a three-hour delay basis on GMA Pinoy TV on 31 December 2013. From 31 December 2013 to 13 January 2014, GMA Pinoy TV had a special airing of ''[[Titser (TV series)|Titser]]''. This was in the timeslot previously occupied by ''Genesis'' and ''Akin Pa Rin Ang Bukas'', as in the Philippines the timeslots of the two shows were replaced by Hollywood blockbusters.

The GMA Pinoy TV on-screen graphics and logo returned to its regular version on 5 January 2014, marking the end of the Christmas season. GMA Pinoy TV began inserting English subtitles in certain shows like ''[[Wish Ko Lang]]'', ''[[Pepito Manaloto|Pepito Manaloto: Ang Tunay na Kuwento]]'' and ''[[Magpakailanman]]'' on Saturday, 11 January 2014. This is part of GMA Pinoy TV's efforts to expand its audience reach so that not only those who can speak and understand Tagalog can watch GMA Pinoy TV but also those who cannot.

On 22 April 2014, GMA Pinoy TV began to air ''[[Full House (2004 TV series)|Full House]]'', the first Tagalog-dubbed Koreanovela aired on this channel. The shows with English subtitles are noted in the next section "currently broadcast". ''[[Basta Every Day, Happy!]]'' was supposed to premiere on 12 May 2014 (in some territories like the US on the evening of 11 May 2014) and air throughout its entire duration on GMA Pinoy TV but the programming department of GMA International, GMA's international subsidiary, decided to move the show over to [[GMA Life TV]] as it adheres more to GMA Life TV's overall theme as a lifestyle channel as well as the show is a replacement for ''[[Chef Boy Logro: Kusina Master|Kusina Master]]'', so the programming department had seen that the move was done rightfully so.

On 26 May 2014, GMA Pinoy TV began to air ''[[Niño (TV series)|Niño]]'' with no episode delay whatsoever, thus premiering on the same day. This is a historical event for GMA Pinoy TV, as GMA drama series have never aired without episode delays. The nearest to not having a delay was the one-episode
delay policy that was established on 14 February 2012 with the premiere of ''[[My Beloved (TV series)|My Beloved]]''. What is going to happen is in the North American feed as well as on the Australian feed, the premiere of ''[[Niño (TV series)|Niño]]'' and subsequent new episodes on same-day airing will take place on the evening telecast and replays in the afternoon telecasts while in other feeds, particularly, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia Pacific and European feeds,  the premiere and subsequent new episodes will take place in the afternoon telecasts and replays on evening telecasts, thus because these telecasts will take place in the afternoon, such is still not considered delayed, as a new episode of the show still has not premiered. This similar framework followed with ''[[Ang Dalawang Mrs. Real]]'', which premiered on 2 June airing on same-day basis as well along with ''[[Strawberry Lane]]'' on 15 September and ''[[Hiram na Alaala]]'' on 22 September. ''[[Ilustrado (TV series)|Ilustrado]]'', the first BayaniSerye on Philippine Primetime, had a world premiere on all feeds of GMA Pinoy TV on 20 October 2014; this was simultaneous with the premiere in the Philippines and this is the first time such has happened in GMA Pinoy TV history.

On December 2014, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-air title screen and graphics and upper-right logo to a Christmas-themed one, alongside GMA's Christmas theme for 2014, "Share the Love". On December 31, 2014, ''Countdown to 2015: The GMA New Year Countdown Special'' aired live on GMA Pinoy TV.

===2015–present===
The GMA Pinoy TV on-screen graphics and logo returned to its regular version on 4 January 2015, marking the end of the Christmas season. In the 1st quarter of 2015, in response to viewers' requests and to remain competitive in the international market, GMA Pinoy TV began to increase the number of shows with English subtitles, now including daily dramas like ''[[Let the Love Begin (TV series)|Let the Love Begin]]'' and ''[[The Rich Man's Daughter]]''.

On May 10, 2015, Willie Revillame's ''[[Wowowin]]'' premiered on [[GMA Network]] and on GMA Pinoy TV, serving as his return to the Kapuso Network. It is noted that Revillame's popular ''[[Wowowee]]'' aired for five years on GMA and GMA Pinoy TV's rival stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/455861/showbiz/willie-revillame-to-host-game-show-wowowin-in-return-to-gma-network/|title=Willie Revillame to host game show ‘WowoWin’ in return to GMA Network|author=|date=|website=GMA News Online|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2015, the sixth and final State of the Nation Address of President Benigno S. Aquino II aired live in the Asia Pacific and aired on a delay basis in North America, North Africa, the Middle East and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/gmapinoytv/photos/a.255667031999.150450.183148856999/10152864846407000/?type=1&amp;theater|title=GMA Pinoy TV|author=|date=|website=www.Facebook.com|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2015 GMA's programming changed from news to other programs to four-five hours programming of Pinoy Telenovela block starting with its AfternoonPrime to GMA telebabad Programming with some programs one day delayed however, has caught up throughout with its future schedules. Eat Bulaga airs its initial programming, and Wowowin, Daily news as well and other programming.

GMA Pinoy TV used the hashtag #Sampuso to celebrate and highlight its 10th year of bringing Filipinos closer to home. The first two concerts were originally supposed to include GMA's Primetime Queen Marian Rivera-Dantes but because of her pregnancy, she chose to withdraw from the concerts for her and her child's safety and AiAi delas Alas served as her replacement in the first two concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/482134/showbiz/gma-pinoy-tv-kicks-off-10th-anniversary-celebration-with-ai-ai-delas-alas-in-kapusong-pinoy-vancouver-and-anaheim/|title=GMA Pinoy TV kicks off 10th anniversary celebration with Ai-Ai delas Alas in Kapusong Pinoy Vancouver and Anaheim|author=|date=|website=GMA News Online|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Sampuso concert was on May 29, 2015 (originally slated for April 24, 2015), at the Orpheum Theater in Vancouver, Canada, featuring AiAi delas Alas, Christian Bautista, Jonalyn Viray, Alden Richards, and Betong Sumaya as Antonietta of [[Bubble Gang]].

'''Global Handwashing Day''' ('''GHD''') is a campaign to motivate and mobilize people around the [[world]] to improve their [[Hand washing|handwashing]] habits.  Washing hands at critical points during the day and washing with [[soap]] are both important. 

Global Handwashing Day occurs on 15 October of each year. The global campaign is dedicated to raising awareness of handwashing with soap as a key factor in [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=20091015004104007&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Lae Marks Global Handwashing Day|last = Rai|first = Frank|date = 12 August 2009|work = Post-Courier (Papua New Guinea)|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Respiratory and intestinal diseases can be reduced by 25-50%.

==Implementation and management==
The Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) (formerly called "[[Public-private partnership|Public Private Partnership]]&amp;nbsp;for Handwashing" (PPPHW)) established Global Handwashing Day in 2008 as a way to promote a global and local vision of handwashing with soap.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=12 October 2012|title=Global Handwashing Day|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=82513752&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=61|issue=40|page=821|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 July 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steering Committee members of the GHP include Colgate-Palmolive; FHI 360; The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Procter &amp; Gamble; UNICEF; Unilever; University at Buffalo; USAID; the Water and Sanitation Programme at the World Bank; and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=The Global Handwashing Partnership|website=globalhandwashing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued research on handwashing habits and practices is commissioned in conjunction with GHD. In 2011, [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget]] (SCA), sponsored a study to assess the handwashing habits of American and Canadian adults, finding that many were not using soap when washing their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=bizwire.c37268574&amp;site=ehost-live|title = New Research Reveals Poor Handwashing Practices|last = |first = |date = 14 October 2011|work = Business Wire|access-date = 10 August 2015|via = Regional Business News – EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aims===
The aims of Global Handwashing Day are to:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Foster and support a general culture of handwashing with soap in all societies
* Shine a spotlight on the state of handwashing in each country
* Raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing with soap.

==Activities==
Each year, over 200 million people celebrate Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208100034/http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day |archivedate=8 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sometimes, groups choose to celebrate GHD on other dates than 15 October. In [[Ethiopia]], 300 people celebrated Global Handwashing Day in [[Addis Ababa]] on 1 November in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://unicefethiopia.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/ethiopia-celebrates-global-handwashing-day/|title = Ethiopia Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last = Bizuwork|first = Demissew|date = 4 November 2013|work = UNICEF Ethiopia|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 15 October 2015, Lupok Central Elementary School, Guiuan Eastern Samar, Philippines celebrated the Global Handwashing Day by doing the proper handwashing before starting classes.

==History==
Global Handwashing Day was initiated by the Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) in August 2008 at the annual [[World Water Week]] in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/our-history/|title = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing – Our History|date = |accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the first Global Handwashing Day took place on 15 October 2008. The date was appointed by the UN General Assembly. The year 2008 was also the [[International Year of Sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/gpsc/events/2008/15_10_08/en/index.html|title = Global Handwashing Day|date = 15 October 2008|accessdate = 24 July 2015|website = World Health Organization|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding bodies in 2008 included: FHI360 (a nonprofit human development organization based in the US),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fhi360.org/about-us|title=fhi360 About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=fhi360|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[UNICEF]], [[Unilever]], [[Water and sanitation program|World Bank Water &amp; Sanitation Program]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]].

===Themes===
*The focus for Global Handwashing Day's inaugural year in 2008 was school children. In that year, the members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than 70 countries. In [[India]] in 2008, [[cricket]] legend [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and his teammates joined an estimated 100 million schoolchildren around the country in lathering up for better health and hygiene as part of the first Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/india_45974.html|title = Star Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar Promotes Handwashing in India|last = Walker|first = Angela|date = 16 October 2008|work = UNICEF|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was initiated to reduce childhood mortality rates and related [[respiratory]] and [[Diarrhea|diarrheal diseases]] by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with [[soap]]. This simple action can reduce the [[mortality rate]] of respiratory disease by 25%. Death from diarrheal diseases can be reduced by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|date=May 2003|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, more than 60 percent of health workers do not adhere to proper hand hygiene. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US health care providers, on average, wash their hands less than half of the time they should. On any given day, one in 25 US hospital patients has at least one health care-associated infection.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings |url=https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of handwashing ===
{{Main article|Handwashing}}
{{tone|section|date=April 2018}}
Handwashing with soap is very effective and the least expensive way to prevent [[diarrhea]] and [[acute respiratory infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=6FI3204107250&amp;site=ehost-live|title=MOH Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last=|first=|date=15 October 2009|work=Arabia 2000|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pneumonia]], a major ARI (acute respiratory infection), is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, killing an estimated 1.8&amp;nbsp;million children per year. [[Diarrhea]] and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5&amp;nbsp;million child deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/The_State_of_the_Worlds_Children_2008.pdf|title=The State of the World’s Children 2008. Child Survival. UNICEF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handwashing with soap is estimated to reduce cases of diarrhea by 30% and respiratory infections by 21% in children under the age of five.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to make handwashing into a [[habit]]. Good handwashing with soap before [[eating]] and after using the toilet into a regular habit can save more lives than any single [[vaccine]] or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute [[respiratory infection]]s by one-quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2013/today-is-global-handwashing-day/|title=Today is Global Handwashing Day|last=Larsen|first=Linda|date=15 October 2013|work=Food Poisoning Bulletin|access-date=24 July 2015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handwashing is usually done together with other [[sanitation]] interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene [[WASH]] programmes.

The Global Handwashing Day helps raise awareness of the importance of washing with soap, but it also makes it fun for children to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=wapo.ea30fbe0-e86a-11e0-8a05-c10ec107dc66&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Getting All Lathered Up|last=Sawyer|first=Kem Knapp|date=10 October 2011|work=The Washington Post|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Regional Business News – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper hygiene requires that individuals know the importance of good hygiene and develop the habits to carry it out.  There are people with plenty of money but nonetheless, they lack the important habits of timely handwashing with soap, and thereby unknowingly endanger themselves and others around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/global-handwashing-day-in_b_5989280.html|title=Global Handwashing Day in the Time of Ebola|author=Jeffrey Sachs|author2=Myriam Sidibe|date=15 October 2014|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peer pressure|Peer influence]] is significant to seeing increased handwashing among students. In a study conducted in [[Kenya]], researchers found that students were much more likely to wash their hands when another student is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Amy J.|last2=Blum|first2=Annalise G.|last3=Breiman|first3=Robert F.|last4=Ram|first4=Pavani K.|last5=Davis|first5=Jennifer|date=27 March 2014|title=Video Surveillance Captures Student Hand Hygiene Behavior, Reactivity to Observation, and Peer Influence in Kenyan Primary Schools|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92571|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|pmc=3968003|pmid=24676389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer influence is only successful, however, when students know that handwashing is a desirable action.

In theory, taking into account [[cultural differences]] and country-specific conditions, it deals with the [[epidemiology]] of [[mental disorder]]s in different countries, their treatment options, mental health education, political and financial aspects, the structure of mental [[health care]] systems, [[Health human resources|human resources]] in mental health, and [[human rights]] issues among others.

The overall aim of the field of global mental health is to strengthen mental health all over the world by providing information about the mental health situation in all countries, and identifying mental health care needs in order to develop cost-effective interventions to meet those specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0|pmid= 17804063|year= 2007|author1= Prince|first1= M|title= No health without mental health|journal= Lancet|volume= 370|issue= 9590|pages= 859–77|last2= Patel|first2= V|last3= Saxena|first3= S|last4= Maj|first4= M|last5= Maselko|first5= J|last6= Phillips|first6= M.

Mental, [[neurological]], and substance use disorders make a substantial contribution to the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]] (GBD).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthinfo/bod/en/index.html ''Global burden of disease'']. Geneva, WHO Health statistics and health information systems. Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a global measure of so-called [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALY's) assigned to a certain disease/disorder, which is a sum of the years lived with disability and years of life lost due to this disease within the total population.  [[Neuropsychiatry|Neuropsychiatric]] conditions account for 14% of the global burden of disease. Among [[non-communicable disease]]s, they account for 28% of the DALY's – more than [[cardiovascular disease]] or [[cancer]]. However, it is estimated that the real contribution of [[mental disorders]] to the global burden of disease is even higher, due to the complex interactions and co-morbidity of physical and mental illness.

Around the world, almost one million people die due to suicide every year, and it is the third leading cause of death among young people. The most important causes of disability due to health-related conditions worldwide include [[unipolar depression]], [[alcoholism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar depression]] and [[dementia]]. In low- and middle-income countries, these conditions represent a total of 19.1% of all disability related to health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/mhtargeting/development_targeting_mh_summary.pdf ''Mental Health and Development: Targeting People with Mental Health Conditions as Vulnerable Group''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment gap ==
It is estimated that one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/index.html ''Mental disorders affect one in four people.''] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many effective interventions for the treatment of mental disorders are known, and awareness of the need for treatment of people with mental disorders has risen, the proportion of those who need mental health care but who do not receive it remains very high.  This so-called "treatment gap" is estimated to reach between 76–85% for low- and middle-income countries, and 35–50% for high-income countries.

Despite the acknowledged need, for the most part there have not been substantial changes in mental health care delivery during the past years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turekian|first1=Vaughan|title=Mental Health Diplomacy|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=2014-06-23|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/editorial/2014/mental-health-diplomacy-building-global-response}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main reasons for this problem are public health priorities, lack of a mental health policy and legislation in many countries, a lack of resources – financial and human resources – as well as inefficient resource allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X|title=Barriers to improvement of mental health services in low-income and middle-income countries|journal=The Lancet|volume=370|issue=9593|pages=1164–1174|year=2007|last1=Saraceno|first1=Benedetto|last2=Van Ommeren|first2=Mark|last3=Batniji|first3=Rajaie|last4=Cohen|first4=Alex|last5=Gureje|first5=Oye|last6=Mahoney|first6=John|last7=Sridhar|first7=Devi|last8=Underhill|first8=Chris | pmid = 17804061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the World Health Organization estimated a shortage of 1.18 million [[mental health professional]]s, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000
nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries. The annual wage bill to remove this [[Health Human Resources|health workforce]] shortage was estimated at about US$4.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffler RM et al. (2011). [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501019_eng.pdf ''Human resources for mental health: workforce shortages in low- and middle-income countries'']. Geneva, World Health Organization Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interventions ==
Information and evidence about cost-effective interventions to provide better mental health care are available.  Although most of the research (80%) has been carried out in high-income countries, there is also strong evidence from low- and middle-income countries that [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] and [[psychosocial]] interventions are effective ways to treat mental disorders, with the strongest evidence for depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hazardous alcohol use.

Recommendations to strengthen mental health systems around the world have been first mentioned in the WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2001'']],&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2001) [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/en/index.html ''The world health report 2001 – Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope'']. Geneva, WHO Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on mental health:

# Provide treatment in primary care
# Make [[psychotropic drug]]s available
# Give care in the community
# Educate the public
# Involve communities, families and consumers
# Establish national policies, programs and [[legislation]]
# Develop [[Health Human Resources|human resources]]
# Link with other sectors
# Monitor community mental health
# Support more research

Based on the data of 12 countries, assessed by the ''WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems'' (WHO-AIMS),&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/WHO-AIMS/en/''Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the costs of scaling up mental health services by providing a core treatment package for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive episodes and hazardous alcohol use have been estimated. Structural changes in mental health systems according to the WHO recommendations have been taken into account.

For most countries, this model suggests an initial period of investment of US$0.30 – 0.50 per person per year. The total expenditure on mental health would have to rise at least ten-fold in low-income countries. In those countries, additional financial resources will be needed, while in middle- and high-income countries the main challenge will be the reallocation of resources within the health system to provide better mental health service.

==Prevention==

Prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 WHO report "Prevention of Mental Disorders", the 2008 EU "Pact for Mental Health" and the 2011 US National Prevention Strategy. NIMH or the National Institute of Mental Health has over 400 grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/research-areas/index.shtml|title=NIMH » Research Areas|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders==

=== World Health Organization (WHO) ===

Two of WHO's core programmes for mental health are WHO MIND (Mental health improvements for Nations Development) and Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).

WHO MIND focuses on 5 areas of action to ensure concrete changes in people's daily lives.  These are:
#  Action in and support to countries to improve mental health, such as the WHO Pacific Island Mental Health network (PIMHnet)
#  Mental health policy, planning and service development
#  Mental health human rights and legislation
#  Mental health as a core part of human development
#  The QualityRights Project which works to unite and empower people to improve the quality of care and promote human rights in mental health facilities and social care homes.

Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) is WHO’s action plan to scale up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders for countries especially with low and lower middle incomes. The aim of mhGAP is to build partnerships for collective action and to reinforce the commitment of governments, international organizations and other stakeholders.

The mhGAP Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) was launched in October 2010.  It is a technical tool for the management of mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialist health settings.  The priority conditions included are: depression, psychosis, bipolar disorders, epilepsy, developmental and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents, dementia, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-harm/suicide and other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints.

== Criticism ==

One of the most prominent critics of the Movement for Global Mental Health has been China Mills, author of the book ''Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World''.

Mills writes that:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mills, China. [https://www.academia.edu/4905979/Decolonizing_Global_Mental_Health_The_Psychiatrization_of_the_Majority_World Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World]. Retrieved October 17, 2014, from&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=This book charts the creeping of psychology and psychiatry across the borders of everyday experience and across geographical borders, as a form of colonialism that comes from within and from outside, swallowed in the form of a pill. It maps an anxious space where socio-economic crises come to be reconfigured as individual crisis – as 'mental illness'; and how potentially violent interventions come to be seen as 'essential' treatment.|sign=|source=}}

Another prominent critic is Ethan Watters, author of ''Crazy Like Us: The Globalization of the American Psyche''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Watters, Ethan (January 8, 2010).

'''Global surveillance whistleblowers''' are [[whistleblowers]] who provided public knowledge of [[global surveillance]].

==Perry Fellwock==
[[Perry Fellwock]] revealed the existence of then ultra secretive [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and its global mass surveillance apparatus and activities, including domestic spying, in a 1971 ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' exposé. This was the first wide exposure of the NSA, which had for decades prevented public knowledge of its abilities and activities. The revelations led the U.S. Senate [[Church Committee]] to introduce successful legislation intended to stop the NSA spying on American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Adrian Chen|Chen, Adrian]] |title=After 30 Years of Silence, the Original NSA Whistleblower Looks Back |url=http://gawker.com/after-30-years-of-silence-the-original-nsa-whistleblow-1454865018 |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RZZIrx96?url=http://gawker.com/after-30-years-of-silence-the-original-nsa-whistleblow-1454865018 |archivedate=2014-08-04 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russ Tice==
In December 2005 [[Russ Tice]] helped spark a national controversy over claims that the NSA and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) were engaged in unlawful and unconstitutional [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]s on American citizens. He later acknowledged that he was one of the sources that were used in ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporting on the wiretap activity in December 2005.&lt;ref name=abc2006&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Brian|title=NSA Whistleblower Alleges Illegal Spying|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1491889|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=10 January 2006|quote=The same day ''The New York Times'' broke the story of the NSA eavesdropping without warrants, Tice surfaced as a whistleblower in the agency.

==Mark Klein==
[[Mark Klein]] is a former [[AT&amp;T]] technician who leaked knowledge of his company's cooperation with the NSA in installing network hardware to covertly monitor, [[Data Capture|capture]], and process American telecommunications en masse. The subsequent media coverage became a major story in May 2006.

In recognition of his actions, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) picked Klein as one of the winners of its 2008 [[EFF Pioneer Award|Pioneer Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = AT&amp;T Whistle-Blower Among Award Winners |first = Anick |last = Jesdanun |date = Feb 27, 2008 |work = |accessdate =Nov 27, 2011 |url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2008/02/27/1329579-att-whistle-blower-among-award-winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 22 years Mark Klein worked for AT&amp;T. Starting with the company as a Communications Technician in New York, where he remained from November 1981 until March 1991, he later continued in that capacity in California until 1998. From January 1998 to October 2003, Klein worked as a Computer Network Associate in San Francisco. From October 2003 to May 2004 he returned to the role of Communications Technician, after which he retired in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Mark Klein, unredacted (June 8, 2006)|url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/SER_klein_decl.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Binney==

He was a high-profile critic of his former employers during the [[George W. Bush]] administration, and was the subject of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigations, including a raid on his home in 2007. He came forward with NSA colleagues [[J. Kirk Wiebe]] and [[Edward Loomis]], in cooperation with [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] staffer [[Diane Roark]].

==Thomas Tamm==
[[Thomas Tamm]] is a former attorney in the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) [[Office of Intelligence Policy and Review]] (OIPR) during the period in 2004 when senior Justice officials fought against the widening scope of [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless NSA surveillance]] that consisted of eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. He was an anonymous whistleblower to ''The New York Times'', making the initial disclosure regarding the issue.

==Thomas Drake==
[[Thomas Andrews Drake]] is a former senior executive at the NSA, a decorated [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and [[United States Navy]] (USN) veteran, and a whistleblower. In 2010 the government alleged that Drake "mishandled" documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the [[Trailblazer Project]].&lt;ref name=shane3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/us/16indict.html |title=Former N.S.A.

==Edward Snowden==
[[Edward Snowden]] is an American computer specialist, a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) employee, who, while working as a [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] contractor, disclosed [[Classified information|top secret]] NSA documents to various media outlets, initiating the [[2013 Global surveillance disclosure|NSA leaks]], which reveal operational details of a [[global surveillance]] apparatus run by the NSA and other members of the [[Five Eyes]] alliance, along with numerous commercial and international partners.&lt;ref name="Der Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Whistleblower Edward Snowden on Global Spying|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=December 18, 2013|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of classified material was called the most significant leak in US history by [[Pentagon Papers]] leaker [[Daniel Ellsberg]]. A [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|series of exposés]] beginning June 5, 2013 revealed Internet surveillance programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore]], and [[Tempora]], as well as the interception of US and European telephone [[metadata]], among other disclosures.

'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning medical geography within the field of [[social geography]] due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well-being in general.  Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]]) are studied by the [[medicine]] researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without [[medical education]]. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].&lt;ref name= "Philo2"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name= "Philo"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Medical Geography". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.&lt;ref name= "Philo" /&gt; A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]]. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ocaña-Riola |first=Ricardo |year=2010 |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |pmid=20503184 |url=http://www.geospatialhealth.unina.it/fulltext.php?f=pdf&amp;ida=90 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1353-8292(95)00002-4 | title=Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography | journal=Health | date=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | first=Andréa | last=Litva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographies of disease and ill health ===
Hsenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and other potential dangers.&lt;ref name="Philo2" /&gt;

=== Geography of health care provision ===
[[File:Coverage by Type of Health Insurance- 2008 and 2009p25.pdf|thumb]]
Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]]. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/money-quality-health-care-longer-life/|title=The costs of inequality: Money = quality health care = longer life|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility and Disease Tracking

With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track [[individual mobility]]. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While [[privacy law]]s question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people .

== Planning ==
=== Background ===
[[Hopewell Holdings]] founder and then-managing director [[Gordon Wu]] proposed the concept of a bridge-tunnel linking China, Hong Kong and Macau in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2169864/property-tycoon-gordon-wus-35-year-dream-massive|title=Tycoon’s 35-year dream finally realised as mega bridge opens|last=Tsang|first=Denise|date=2018-10-23|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu stated that he got the idea in 1983 from the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel]]. In 1988, Wu pitched the concept to Guangdong and Beijing officials. He envisaged a link farther north than the current design, beginning at Black Point near [[Tuen Mun]], Hong Kong and crossing the Pearl River estuary via [[Nei Lingding Island|Neilingding Island]] and [[Qi'ao Island]]. His proposed bridge would end at the Chinese village of Tangjia, and a new road would continue south through Zhuhai before terminating at Macau.&lt;ref name="bridgetochina"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stoner |first1=Tad |title=$6b bridge to China plan |work=South China Morning Post |date=3 November 1988 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions stalled after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square massacre]] in mid-1989 "unnerved" Wu and other foreign investors, and caused Hopewell's Hong Kong share prices to plunge.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurbecomes"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Christopher |title=Entrepreneur Becomes a Weather Vane For Resuming Business in China Now |work=The Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition |date=29 December 1989 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The route proposed by Wu was promoted by the government of [[Zhuhai]] under the name [[Lingdingyang Bridge]]. In the mid-1990s, Zhuhai built a bridge between the mainland and Qi'ao Island that was intended as the first phase of this route, though the full scheme had not been approved by either the Chinese nor Hong Kong governments at that time.&lt;ref name="firstlingdingyang"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cheung |first1=Agnes |title=First Lingdingyang link nearly ready |work=South China Morning Post |date=29 March 1995 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's central government showed support for this project on 30 December 1997.&lt;ref name="beijingapproves97"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Szeto |first1=Wanda |last2=Ng |first2=Kang-chung |title=Beijing approves Zhuhai-HK bridge |work=South China Morning Post |page=1 |date=31 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Hong Kong government was reticent, stating that it was still awaiting cross-border traffic study results, and Hong Kong media questioned the environmental impact of the project with regard to air pollution, traffic and marine life.&lt;ref name="toofar"&gt;{{cite news |title=A bridge too far |work=South China Morning Post |date=2 January 1998 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] passed a motion urging the Administration to develop the logistics industry including the construction of a bridge connecting Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao. At a meeting of the China/Hong Kong Conference on Co-ordination of Major Infrastructure Projects held on 20 September 2002, it was agreed that a joint study should be conducted on the transport link between Hong Kong and Pearl River West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legco.gov.hk/database/english/data_tp/tp-zhuhzi-macao-bridge.htm|title=Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao Bridge (HZMB)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparation ===
To coordinate the project, the Advance Work Coordination Group of HZMB was set up in 2003. Officials from three sides solved the issues such as landing points and alignments of the bridge, operations of the Border Crossing Facilities and project financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmb.org/en/bencandy.asp?id=2|title=Introduction to Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge - Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridg|website=www.hzmb.org|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, China's Central Government, the governments of [[Guangdong]], Hong Kong and Macau agreed to finance 42% of the total costs. The remaining 58% consisted of loans (approximately 22 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] or US$ 3.23 billion) from [[Bank of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mingxin |last=Bi |title=Bank of China to lead loan consortium for Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-04/14/content_11186292.htm |work=Window of China |publisher=Xinhuanet |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024042455/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-04/14/content_11186292.htm |archivedate=24 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, it was further reported that China's Central Government, Hong Kong and Macau agreed to finance 22% of the total costs. The remaining 78% consisted of loans (approximately 57.3 billion yuan or US$ 8.4 billion) from a consortium of banks led by [[Bank of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Cheng |title=China Builds Bridge to Link Southern Cities |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126088119555891949?mod=googlenews_wsj |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013144446/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126088119555891949?mod=googlenews_wsj |archivedate=13 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sections and elements ==
The 55-km ({{Convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) HZMB consists of three main sections: the Main Bridge ({{Convert|29.6|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the middle of the Pearl River estuary, the Hong Kong Link Road ({{Convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the east and the Zhuhai Link Road ({{Convert|13.4|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the west of the estuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=116030&amp;sid=3|title=China border control at sea crossing|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hzmb.gov.hk/en/|title=Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao Bridge|website=www.hzmb.gov.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Main Bridge ===
The Main Bridge, the largest part of the HZMB project, is a bridge-cum-tunnel system constructed by the mainland Chinese authorities.&lt;ref name="hkMainBridge"&gt;{{cite web |title=HZMB Main Bridge |url=http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/about_overview_01.html |publisher=[[Highways Department]] (Hong Kong) |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It connects an artificial island, housing the Boundary Crossing Facilities (BCF) for both mainland China and Macau in the west, to the Hong Kong Link Road in the east.

This section includes a 22.9-km ({{Convert|22.9|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) viaduct and a 6.7-km ({{Convert|6.7|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) undersea tunnel that runs between two artificial islands. The viaduct crosses the Pearl River estuary with three cable-stayed bridges spanning between 280 and 460 metres (920 and 1,510 ft), allowing shipping traffic to pass underneath.&lt;ref&gt;Website of [[Transport and Housing Bureau]] ([[Hong Kong|HKSAR]]): [http://www.thb.gov.hk/eng/policy/transport/issues/cbt_3.htm "Cross boundary traffic: Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118160158/http://www.thb.gov.hk/eng/policy/transport/issues/cbt_3.htm |date=18 January 2010 }}.

Retrieved 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong Link Road ===
Under Hong Kong jurisdiction, the Hong Kong Link Road was built by [[Highways Department|Highway Department]] to connect the Main Bridge to an artificial island housing the Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities (HKBCF). This section includes a 9.4-km ({{Convert|9.4|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) viaduct, a 1-km ({{Convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) Scenic Hill Tunnel and a 1.6-km ({{Convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=out}}) at-grade road along the east coast of the [[Hong Kong International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/about_overview_02.html|title=HongKong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) : Hong Kong Link Road|website=www.hzmb.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2018/01/20180120/20180120_113410_060.html|title=Bridge link road surfacing completed|website=Hong Kong's Information Services Department|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hyd.gov.hk/en/road_and_railway/hzmb_projects/6787th/HZM6844TH-PD0005.pdf|title=Plot of Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao Baridge - Hong Kong Link Road|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zhuhai Link Road ===
The Zhuhai Link Road starts from an artificial island housing the Boundary Crossing Facilities for both mainland China and Macau, passes through the developed area of [[Gongbei Subdistrict|Gongbei]] via a tunnel towards Zhuhai, and connects to three major expressways, namely, the [[Jingzhu Expressway|Jing-Zhu Expressway]], Guang-Zhu West Expressway and Jiang-Zhu Expressway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/about_overview_06.html|title=HongKong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) : Connectivity to Pearl River West|website=www.hzmb.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Albert|date=2016-01-29|title=Geotechnical works of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Project|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292213640_Geotechnical_works_of_the_Hong_Kong-Zhuhai-Macao_Bridge_Project|journal=Japanese Geotechnical Society Special Publication|volume=2|pages=109–121|doi=10.3208/jgssp.ESD-KL-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hyd.gov.hk/en/road_and_railway/hzmb_projects/6787th/HZM6844TH-PD0005.pdf|title=Hong Kong Link Road (HKLR)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Left- and right-hand traffic ==
Although the HZMB connects two [[left-hand traffic]] (LHT) areas, namely Hong Kong and Macau, the crossing itself is [[right-hand traffic]] (RHT), the same as in Zhuhai and other regions of China. Thus, drivers from Hong Kong and Macau need to make use of crossing viaducts to switch to RHT upon entering the bridge, and back to LHT upon leaving the bridge when they are back to Hong Kong and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/02/21/cars-may-drive-right-hong-kong-zhuhai-macao-bridge-despite-citys-left-hand-traffic-arrangement/|title=Cars may drive on the right on Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, despite city's left-hand traffic arrangement {{!}} Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|date=2017-02-21|work=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://html2-f.scribdassets.com/4jy6fyf98g5q0dpy/images/15-456a6791f3.png|title=Interface of "Left-driving" &amp; "Right-driving" Arrangement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic between Zhuhai and the bridge requires no left-right conversion as they are both RHT.&lt;ref name="rightside"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Su |first1=Xinqi |last2=Yeung |first2=Raymond |title=Right side of road the only way to travel on Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2133246/right-side-road-only-way-travel-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge |work=South China Morning Post |date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==

=== Shuttle buses ===
[[File:VR6495 at HZMB Zhuhai Port (20181024103741).jpg|thumb|Shuttle buses between Hong Kong and Zhuhai/Macau]]
Shuttle buses are available 24 hours a day and depart up to every 5 minutes with tickets available for purchase from vending machines or ticket counters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmbus.com|title=HZMBus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hzmbus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They take around 40 minutes to cross the HZMB.

The HZMB Hong Kong Port can be reached from Hong Kong by taxis or various buses including CityFlyer airport (A-number) routes, or the B5 shuttle bus from Sunny Bay MTR station, or the B6 bus from [[Tung Chung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmbus.com/passenger_service.html?id=53|title=Shuttle bus services at Hong Kong Port (in Chinese)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hzmbus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HZMB Zhuhai Port can be reached from the mainland by taxis or the L1 bus which uses historic tourist vehicles, or Line-12, 23, 25 or 3 buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmbus.com/passenger_service.html?id=45|title=Shuttle bus services at Zhuhai Port (in Chinese)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hzmbus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HZMB Macau Port can be reached from Macau by taxis or various buses including the 101X bus and the 102X bus from St Paul's and Taipa, or the HZMB Integrated Resort Connection bus from Taipa Ferry Terminal or the Exterior Ferry terminal, connecting with free casino shuttle buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hzmbus.com/passenger_service.html?id=60|title=Shuttle bus services at Macau Port (in Chinese)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hzmbus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private vehicles and restrictions ===
Currently only 10,000 permits are available for private vehicles to drive across the HZMB from Hong Kong to Zhuhai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2124010/hong-kongs-bridge-zhuhai-allow-7000-extra-cars-cross-after|title=Zhuhai bridge to allow 7,000 more cars after high demand|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the number of vehicles permitted to enter Hong Kong and Macau from other regions is subject to a daily quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/licences_and_permits/closed_road_permit_for_cross_boundary_vehicles/rq_hk_private_cars_to_macao_access_city_centre/index.html|title=Transport Department - Regular Quota for Hong Kong Private Cars to Macao (Access to City Centre)|website=www.td.gov.hk|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Hong Kong government imposes significant fees, taxes and administrative paperwork on private car ownership and usage to deal with road congestion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moneyhero.com.hk/blog/en/how-much-does-it-cost-to-own-a-car-in-hong-kong|title=The cost of owning a car in Hong Kong|website=www.moneyhero.com.hk|language=en-HK|access-date=2018-10-22|date=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; driving a car on the HZMB would incur the same restrictions as current cross-border traffic. These include applying for separate driving licences for both Hong Kong and mainland China, a Hong Kong Closed Road Permit for cross-boundary vehicles, and an Approval Notice from the Guangdong Public Security Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.hk/en/residents/transport/crossboundary/xb_driving.htm|title=GovHK: Cross-boundary Driving|last=(www.gov.hk)|first=GovHK|website=www.gov.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/licences_and_permits/closed_road_permit_for_cross_boundary_vehicles/index.html|title=Transport Department - Closed Road Permit for Cross-boundary Vehicles|website=www.td.gov.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicle owners also need to ensure they have the appropriate insurance coverage for the regions they are travelling to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Insurance Authority - Motor insurance for using Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) |url=https://www.ia.org.hk/en/infocenter/faqs/faqs_13.html |website=www.ia.org.hk |language=zh-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic effects ==
The HZMB links three major cities Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macau, which are geographically close but separated by water. With the bridge in place, travelling time between Zhuhai and Hong Kong would cut down from about four hours to 30 minutes on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45937924|title=World's longest sea crossing: Hong Kong-Zhuhai bridge opens|date=2018-10-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-07/07/content_30035204.htm|title=Main structure of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is completed[1]- Chinadaily.com.cn|last=郭凯|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HZMB project is part of a [[Beijing]]-driven strategy to create an economic hub and promote the economic development of the whole area of the [[Pearl River Delta]], which is also known as Greater Bay Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2018/10/23/chinas-president-launches-hong-kong-mainland-mega-bridge/|title=China's president launches Hong Kong-mainland mega bridge - ASEAN Plus {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to leverage the bridge and create an economic zone linking the three cities, Zhuhai's [[Hengqin]] area was designated as a free trade zone in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Economy/Hong-Kong-Zhuhai-Macau-Bridge-construction-set-to-finish-this-year|title=Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge construction set to finish this year|website=Nikkei Asian Review|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Delays and budget overruns ===
The artificial island housing the Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities (HKBCF) was reported drifting due to an unconventional method, hitherto unused in Hong Kong, for land reclamation with steel circular cells in a row pushed through the mud and filled with inert material to form a seawall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/doc/BCF%20Newsletter%20Issue%201%20E-A4.pdf|title=Newsletter 2012 July|date=July 2012|website=Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Related Hong Kong Projects|publisher=Highways Department|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126121032/http://www.hzmb.hk/eng/doc/BCF%20Newsletter%20Issue%201%20E-A4.pdf|archivedate=26 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drifting of parts of the reclaimed island had allegedly caused a delay in the HZMB project. The Highways Department denied reports in various sources of movement up to 20 metres but admitted parts of the reclaimed land had moved "up to six or seven metres",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150923-island-drift-threatens-further-delays-in-cross-border-bridge/|title=Island drift threatens further delays in cross-border bridge|date=23 September 2015|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126120958/http://www.ejinsight.com/20150923-island-drift-threatens-further-delays-in-cross-border-bridge/|archivedate=26 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hkfp1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/11/25/delays-of-up-to-5-years-for-hk30bn-moving-macau-bridge-crossing-facilities/|title=Delays of up to 5 years for HK$30bn ‘moving’ Macau bridge crossing facilities|last1=Winn|first1=Howard|date=25 November 2015|work=Hong Kong Free Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126102937/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/11/25/delays-of-up-to-5-years-for-hk30bn-moving-macau-bridge-crossing-facilities/|archivedate=26 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1860898/seven-metre-drift-hong-kong-artificial-island-reclaimed-bridge|title=Seven-metre drift on Hong Kong artificial island reclaimed for bridge project is normal, say officials|last1=Siu|first1=Phila|date=24 September 2015|work=South China Morning Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119185623/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1860898/seven-metre-drift-hong-kong-artificial-island-reclaimed-bridge|archivedate=19 November 2015|deadurl=no|last2=Lee|first2=Eddie|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that some movement was expected and safety had not been jeopardised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/article/1861223/shifting-sands-flaws-blamed-problems-artificial-island-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau|title=Shifting sands: 'flaws' blamed for problems at artificial island for Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge|last1=Ng|first1=Kang-chung|date=25 September 2015|work=South China Morning Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130023339/http://www.scmp.com/news/article/1861223/shifting-sands-flaws-blamed-problems-artificial-island-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau|archivedate=30 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainland contractors were also reportedly having difficulty in constructing immersed tubes in their section of the project, with the director of the Guangdong National Development and Reform Commission stating that 2020 would be a difficult target to meet.&lt;ref name="hkfp1" /&gt;

In 2017, the Main Bridge of the HZMB project experienced a cost overrun of about 10 billion yuan, arising from an increase in labor and material costs, as well as the refinement of the design and construction schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/11/22/china-stretch-hong-kong-zhuhai-macao-bridge-hits-another-budget-overrun-totalling-hk11-7-billion/|title=China stretch of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge hits another budget overrun totalling HK$11.7 billion|date=2017-11-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206161803/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/11/22/china-stretch-hong-kong-zhuhai-macao-bridge-hits-another-budget-overrun-totalling-hk11-7-billion/|archivedate=6 December 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=2017-12-06|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worker deaths and injuries ===
The number of deaths and injuries that have taken place on the project has come under scrutiny in Hong Kong. Apart from nine fatal cases on the mainland side,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45937924|title=China opens longest sea-crossing bridge|date=2018-10-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been ten deaths reported on the Hong Kong side of the construction project, and somewhere between 234 and 600 injuries, depending on the source.&lt;ref name="slam"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/04/11/lawmakers-slam-govt-misleading-death-rates-related-hk-zhuhai-macau-bridge-project/|title=Lawmakers slam gov’t over ‘misleading’ death rates related to HK-Zhuhai-Macau bridge project|last1=Ng|first1=Ellie|date=11 April 2017|work=Hong Kong Free Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413235316/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/04/11/lawmakers-slam-govt-misleading-death-rates-related-hk-zhuhai-macau-bridge-project/|archivedate=13 April 2017|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, the Construction Site Workers General Union, the [[Labour Party (Hong Kong)|Labour Party]] and the [[Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions|Confederation of Trade Unions]] demonstrated at the [[Central Government Complex]], demanding the government take action.&lt;ref name="regrets"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/04/12/govt-regrets-fatalities-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge-project-workers-demand-halt-murders/|title=Gov’t ‘regrets’ fatalities at Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge project, as workers demand halt to ‘murders’|last1=Ng|first1=Ellie|date=12 April 2017|work=Hong Kong Free Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414080754/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/04/12/govt-regrets-fatalities-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge-project-workers-demand-halt-murders/|archivedate=14 April 2017|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmaker [[Fernando Cheung]] also expressed concerns over the unknown death toll on the Chinese side of the project, stating: "the project is known as the 'bridge of blood and tears’ and we are only talking about the Hong Kong side. We don’t even know what is happening in China. I suppose the situation could be 10 times worse than that in Hong Kong." He said that the Hong Kong Government had a responsibility to consider worker safety on the Chinese side.&lt;ref name="regrets" /&gt;

=== Faked safety testing ===

In 2017, Hong Kong's [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] (ICAC) arrested 21 employees (two senior executives, 14 laboratory technicians and five laboratory assistants) of Jacobs China Limited, a contractor of the Civil Engineering and Development Department for falsifying concrete test results, thus potentially risking the safety of bridge for public use.&lt;ref name="fakelab"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/05/24/arrests-fake-lab-tests-mega-bridge-project-damages-trust-govt-lawmakers-warn/|title=‘Fake’ lab tests at mega bridge project damage trust in gov’t, lawmakers warn|last1=Ng|first1=Ellie|date=24 May 2017|work=Hong Kong Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, a lab technician pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for eight months, while the others await sentencing. Hong Kong's Highways Department conducted tests again after the falsified results were exposed and found all test results met safety standards.&lt;ref name="labtechnician"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/12/01/lab-technician-jailed-8-months-falsifying-hong-kong-zhuhai-macao-bridge-test-records/|title=Lab technician jailed for 8 months after falsifying Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge test records|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|date=1 December 2017|work=Hong Kong Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seawall integrity ===
In April 2018, the public and media raised questions over the integrity of the seawalls protecting the artificial islands at both ends of the undersea tunnel. In footage taken by drone users and mariners, the [[dolos]]se installed at the edges of the artificial islands appear to have dislodged. Some civil engineers suggested that there was an error in design.&lt;ref name="bridgeproblem"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://lantaunews.com/2018/04/05/this-weeks-bridge-problem-tunnels-face-flooding-threat/|title=This week’s bridge problem: tunnel faces flooding threat|last1=Clark|first1=Robert|date=5 April 2018|work=Lantau News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="illusion"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/04/03/hk-zhuhai-macao-bridge-components-found-drifting-artificial-island-authority-claims-may-illusion/|title=HK-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge components found drifting from artificial island, as authority claims it may be an ‘illusion’|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|date=3 April 2018|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dismissing the safety concerns, the HZMB Authority said the dolosse were designed to be submerged and the design was working as intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2140330/safety-concerns-over-artificial-island-mega-hong-kong-zhuhai|title=Drifting away?

Subsequent aerial footage posted online showed a section of the dolosse breakwater completely underwater. Civil engineer So Yiu-kwan told Hong Kong media on 12 April 2018 that the water level, at the time the photos were taken, was about 1.74 mPD (metres above Principal Datum), but the maximum water level could reach 2.7 mPD. He said the dolosse would offer no wave protection if entirely submerged, and further alleged that they had been installed backwards.&lt;ref name="underwaterhightide"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/04/12/sea-bridge-islands-breakwater-blocks-offer-no-protection-underwater-high-tide-says-veteran-engineer/|title=Sea bridge island’s breakwater blocks offer no protection as they are underwater at high tide, says veteran engineer|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|date=12 April 2018|work=Hong Kong Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falling number of dolphins===
Conservationists at [[WWF Hong Kong]] blamed the construction of the HZMB for the falling number of [[Sousa chinensis|white dolphins]] in the waters near the bridge. The dolphins found near waters of [[Lantau]] were worst hit with numbers dropping by 60 per cent between April 2015 and March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Experts blame Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge for falling dolphin numbers |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/1990312/experts-blame-hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge |accessdate=28 October 2018 |agency=SCMP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hydrosphere''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὕδωρ ''hydōr'', "water"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Du%28%2Fdwr ὕδωρ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and σφαῖρα ''sphaira'', "sphere"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^ σφαῖρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is the combined mass of [[water]] found on, under, and above the surface of a [[planet]], [[minor planet]] or [[natural satellite]]. Although the hydrosphere has been around for longer than 4 billion years, it continues to change in size. This is caused by the seafloor spreading and the [[continental drift]], which rearranges the land and ocean. &lt;ref&gt;“Our Changing Planet: an Introduction to Earth System Science and Global Environmental Change.” Our Changing Planet: an Introduction to Earth System Science and Global Environmental Change, by Fred T. Mackenzie, 2nd ed., Pearson Education, 2011, pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that there are 1,386 million cubic kilometers of water on Earth.&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998&gt;{{cite report|url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/publications/waterway/webpc/world_water_resources.html |publisher=UNESCO |date=1998 |accessdate=13 June 2013 |title=World Water Resources: A New Appraisal and Assessment for the 21st Century |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927160221/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/publications/waterway/webpc/world_water_resources.html |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes water in liquid and frozen forms in groundwater, oceans, lakes and streams. Saltwater accounts for 97.5% of this amount. [[Fresh water]] accounts for only 2.5%. Of this fresh water, 68.9% is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in the Arctic, the Antarctic, and mountain glaciers.  30.8% is in the form of fresh [[groundwater]]. Only 0.3% of the fresh water on Earth is in easily accessible lakes, reservoirs and river systems.&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt; The total mass of the [[Earth]]'s hydrosphere is about 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; [[tonnes]], which is about 0.023% of Earth's total mass. About 20 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[tonnes]] of this is in [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] (for practical purposes, 1 cubic meter of water weighs one tonne). Approximately 71% of Earth's [[Planetary surface|surface]], an area of some 361 million square kilometers (139.5 million square miles), is covered by [[ocean]]. The average [[salinity]] of Earth's oceans is about 35&amp;nbsp;grams of [[salt]] per kilogram of sea water (3.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael J.|last=Kennish|year=2001|title=Practical handbook of marine science|page=35|edition=3rd|publisher=CRC Press|series=Marine science series|isbn=0-8493-2391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water cycle==
{{main article|Water cycle}}
[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|right|393x393px]]
The [[water cycle]] refers to the transfer of water from one state or reservoir to another. Reservoirs include [[Water vapor|atmospheric moisture]] (snow, rain and clouds), streams, oceans, rivers, lakes, [[groundwater]], [[wikt:subterranean#English|subterranean]] [[aquifer]]s, [[polar ice cap]]s and saturated soil. [[Solar energy]], in the form of heat and light ([[insolation]]), and [[gravity]] cause the transfer from one state to another over periods from hours to thousands of years. Most [[evaporation]] comes from the oceans and is returned to the earth as snow or rain.&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003 /&gt;{{rp|27}} [[Sublimation (phase transition)|Sublimation]] refers to evaporation from snow and ice. Transpiration refers to the expiration of water through the minute pores or stomata of trees. [[Evapotranspiration]] is the term used by [[hydrology|hydrologists]] in reference to the three processes together, transpiration, sublimation and evaporation.&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003 /&gt;

[[Marq de Villiers]] has described the hydrosphere as a [[closed system]] in which water exists. The hydrosphere is intricate, complex, interdependent, all-pervading and stable and "seems purpose-built for regulating life."&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003&gt;{{cite book|author= Marq de Villiers|title= Water: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource|url= |accessdate= |year=2003|publisher= McClelland &amp; Stewart|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-7710-2641-6|oclc = 43365804|edition=2|pages=453}}, revised 2003|[[Governor General's Award for English-language non-fiction|Governor General's Award]] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} De Villiers claimed that, "On earth, the total amount of water has almost certainly not changed since geological times: what we had then we still have. Water can be polluted, abused, and misused but it is neither created nor destroyed, it only migrates. There is no evidence that water vapor escapes into space."&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003 /&gt;{{rp|26}}

"Every year the turnover of water on Earth involves 577,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water. This is water that evaporates from the oceanic surface (502,800 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and from land (74,200 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The same amount of water falls as atmospheric precipitation, 458,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on the ocean and 119,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on land. The difference between precipitation and evaporation from the land surface (119,000 - 74,200 = 44,800 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year) represents the total runoff of the Earth's rivers (42,700 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year) and direct groundwater runoff to the ocean (2100 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year). These are the principal sources of fresh water to support life necessities and man's economic activities."&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt;

Water is a basic necessity of life. Since 2/3 of the Earth is covered by water, the Earth is also called the blue planet and the watery planet.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;According to planetary geologist, [[Ronald Greeley]], "Water is very common in the outer solar system."{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Europa holds more water than earth's oceans.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrosphere plays an important role in the existence of the atmosphere in its present form. Oceans are important in this regard. When the Earth was formed it had only a very thin atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium similar to the present atmosphere of Mercury. Later the gases hydrogen and helium were expelled from the atmosphere. The gases and water vapor released as the Earth cooled became its present atmosphere. Other gases and water vapor released by volcanoes also entered the atmosphere. As the Earth cooled the water vapor in the atmosphere condensed and fell as rain. The atmosphere cooled further as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in to rain water. In turn this further caused the water vapor to condense and fall as rain. This rain water filled the depressions on the Earth's surface and formed the oceans. It is estimated that this occurred about 4000 million years ago. The first life forms began in the oceans. These organisms did not breathe oxygen. Later, when [[cyanobacteria]] evolved, the process of conversion of carbon dioxide into food and oxygen began. As a result, Earth's atmosphere has a distinctly different composition from that of other planets and allowed for [[Evolutionary history of life|life to evolve on Earth]].

==Recharging reservoirs==
According to Igor A. Shiklomanov, it takes 2500 years for the complete recharge and replenishment of oceanic waters, 10,000 years for [[permafrost]] and ice, 1500 years for deep groundwater and mountainous glaciers, 17 years in lakes and 16 days in rivers.&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt;

==Specific fresh water availability==
"Specific water availability is the residual (after use) per capita quantity of fresh water."&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt; Fresh water resources are unevenly distributed in terms of space and time and can go from floods to water shortages within months in the same area. In 1998 76% of the total population had a specific water availability of less than 5.0 thousand m3 per year per capita. Already by 1998, 35% of the global population suffered "very low or catastrophically low water supplies" and Shiklomanov predicted that the situation would deteriorate in the twenty-first century with "most of the Earth's population will be living under the conditions of low or catastrophically low water supply" by 2025. There is only 2.5% of fresh water in the hydrosphere and only 0.25% of water is accessible for our use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6727">'''Hyper-globalization''' is a term used to describe the dramatic change in the size, scope and velocity of globalization that began in the late 1990s and that continues into the beginning of the 21st century. It covers all three main dimensions of [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]], and [[political globalization]]. The term appeared in the 2011 work by [[Dani Rodrik]] an economist and professor of International Political Economy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, who used the term in his ''The Globalization Paradox: Democracy and the Future of the World Economy''. Rodrik used the term as a criticism of state of globalization, questioning the wisdom of unlimited economic integration beyond national borders. He sees a conflict between the workings of the nation state and free flow economic globalization that has gone too far “toward an impractical version that we might call hyperglobalization.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodrik|first1=Dani|title=The globalization paradox : democracy and the future of the world economy|date=2011|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=9780393071610|pages=200–201|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Arvind Subramanian and Martin Kessler used the term in their ''The Hyperglobalization of Trade and Its Future'', to describe the dramatic increase in world trade that has occurred since the founding of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1995.&lt;ref name="Kessler2013"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Martin Kessler|author2=Arvind Subramanian|title=The Hyperglobalization of Trade and Its Future|url=https://piie.com/publications/working-papers/hyperglobalization-trade-and-its-future|website=PIIE.Com|publisher=Peterson Institute of International Economics|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was extended beyond economic globalization to include the realms of culture and politics in 2018 by Public Relations consultant and academician, Takashi Inoue. In his ''Public Relations in Hyper-Globalization'' he argues that the world is being transformed by three forces of hyper-globalization: economic, social media, and new disruptive technologies that together are accelerating the pace of change in all spheres. Inoue argues that this is the new reality in which leaders must now operate in.&lt;ref name="Inoue2018HYP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inoue|first1=Takashi|title=Public Relations in Hyper-Globalization: Essential Relationship Management – A Japan Perspective|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1138054967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyper-globalization as globalization gone too far ==
Dani Rodrik defines hyper-globalization as a type of globalization aimed at the elimination of all transaction costs associated with the movement between the natural borders of nation states of goods, services, capital and finance. These costs are not limited to just tariffs and quotas, but also includes things such as domestic regulations, standards, rules on product safety, rules on intellectual property, and banking regulations. In other words, Rodrik sees hyper-globalization as a type of globalization that allows multinational companies to avoid the rules and regulations of nation states. The deep integration of hyper-globalization conflicts with and threatens the sovereignty of the nation state. Rodrik concludes that hyper-globalization is globalization that has gone too far. He rejects the solution of using [[intergovernmental organizations]] as a way to provide governance, because by definition that requires nation states to give up sovereignty and thus it is not compatible with democracy. He does not argue to stop or reduce globalization, but rather to change the rules of globalization away from hyper-globalization to activity that does not conflict with national sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Rodrik2016NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodrik|first1=Dani|title=Put Globalization to Work for Democracies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/opinion/sunday/put-globalization-to-work-for-democracies.html|accessdate=1 May 2018|publisher=The New York Times, Opinion|date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyper-globalization’s origins, its size, scope and velocity ==
Subramanian and Kessler argue that the world is now in an era of “hyper-globalization, where world trade has soared much more rapidly than world GDP.” They note that in the period since the late 1990s there was a surge in economic activity in the developing world. Prior to the late 1990s only 30 percent of the developing world or 21 countries out of 72 were catching up to the United States as the economic frontier, but since the late 1990s that number jumped nearly 75 percent or 75 out of 103 countries. The rate at which convergence with the U.S. was occurring jumped from 1.5 percent per capita per year to 3.3 percent per capita after the late 1990s.  They call the period between 1870 and 1914 the Golden Age of globalization in which world trade in terms of GDP went from a 9 percent to 16 percent share. However, in the current age of hyper-globalization, which includes both goods and services, the GDP share has reached 33 percent.They explain that China, which gained entry into the WTO in 2001, has become the world’s sole mega-trader. At the height of the Golden Age of globalization in 1913 Great Britain was the world’s megatrader with its share of GDP of 18.5 percent. In contrast, China’s share of GDP has reached 50%.&lt;ref name="Kessler2013"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Martin Kessler|author2=Arvind Subramanian|title=The Hyperglobalization of Trade and Its Future|url=https://piie.com/publications/working-papers/hyperglobalization-trade-and-its-future|website=PIIE.Com|publisher=Peterson Institute of International Economics|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three forces of hyper-globalization  ==

Takashi Inoue describes three forces of hyper-globalization: (1) Economic force in which extensive growth in global trade creates cross-border economic integration, (2) Human communications force via the Internet in which instant and global communication of social media and the Internet are changing norms of human communication blurring social barriers, and (3) Technological disruption force coming from new innovations in technology driven by Internet-of-Things (IoT), big data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) bringing massive economic and rapid social changes leading to a world of Singularity. His main argument is that these three forces are creating a new reality for which global leaders must now be proficient in stakeholder relationship management of strategic public relations.&lt;ref name="Inoue2018HYP" /&gt;

Signed in law in 1994 by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], this act was meant to streamline the U.S. international broadcasting and provide a cost-effective way to continue [[Radio Free Europe]]/ [[Radio Liberty]], [[Voice of America]], and [[Radio Marti]].&lt;ref name="Raghavan"&gt;Raghavan, Sudarsan V., Stephen S. Johnson, Kristi K. Bahrenburg. Sending cross-border static: on the fate of Radio Free Europe and the influence of international broadcasting. Journal of International Affairs, Vol. 47, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It placed control of the international broadcasting under the [[United States Information Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;United States International Broadcasting Act, Pub. L. No. 103-236, title. III.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1958, President Eisenhower in an address to the United Nations proposed monitoring radio broadcasts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that this Assembly should ... consider means for monitoring the radio broadcasts directed across national frontiers in the troubled Near East area. It should then examine complaints from these nations which consider their national security jeopardized by external propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Dept of State Bulletin 337-342 at 339. 1958 Statement to the UN, August 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1960s, President Kennedy to build an international broadcasting arm of the United States to as a way to promote foreign policy and overthrow socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Jon T. Powell, "Towards a Negotiable Definition of Propaganda for International Agreements Related to Direct Broadcast Satellites," Law &amp; Contemporary Problems 45 (1982): 3, 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Voice of America charter that established it as the leading branch of US international broadcasting.

In 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed cutting the budget for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty in order to reduce budget expenditures.&lt;ref name="Raghavan" /&gt; However, after working with the Congress, the International Broadcasting Act was born.

==Original law==
This Act (Public Law 103-236) consolidated all non-military, U.S. Government international broadcast services under a [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG) and also created the [[International Broadcasting Bureau]] (IBB).&lt;ref name="IBB Fact Sheet"&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/usia/usiahome/ibbfacts.htm IBB Fact Sheet. University of Illinois Chicago. Web]&lt;/ref&gt; The BBG is an independent government agency created to replace the [[Board for International Broadcasting]] and consolidate [[Voice of America]] broadcasting.&lt;ref name="BBG"&gt;[http://www.bbg.gov/about/faq/ Broadcasting Board of Governors FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this law, the President appoints one member of the board as the Chairman of the board. The Secretary of State also serves on the board.&lt;ref name="uscode" /&gt;

Besides combining current radio service, this Act also created the Radio Free Asia - a network aimed at Burma, China, Cambodia, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Monroe. The Transformation of international broadcasting. Global Media and National Controls: Rethinking the Role of the State, MIT Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional updates==
In September 2009, the [[111th Congress]] amended the International Broadcasting Act to allow a one year extension of the operation of Radio Free Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Text Versions for the 111th Congress, 2009 - 2010. The Library of Congress.[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3593rfs/pdf/BILLS-111hr3593rfs.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Act was amended to include the Radio Free Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="uscode"&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/22C71.txt U.S. Code. House of Representatives]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Health Partnership''' ('''IHP+''') is a group of partners committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries. International organizations, bilateral agencies and country governments all sign the IHP+ Global Compact. They commit to putting the principles for [[aid effectiveness]] and development cooperation into practice in the health sector. IHP+ achieves results by mobilizing national governments, development agencies, civil society and others to support a single, country-led national health strategy. Partners aim to hold one another to account. This global initiative is administered by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]].

Faster progress to achieve results requires governments, CSOs, the private sector and especially international development partners to take action. The most critical areas for action for development partners have become known as the "seven behaviours".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/news-events/article/seven-behaviours-how-development-partners-can-change-for-the-better-325359/&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.smartglobalhealth.org/blog/entry/leaders-re-focus-ihp-to-improve-health-aid-coordination Global health agency leaders] recently endorsed these seven behaviours, and have met five times in order to discuss obstacles to progress in these key seven areas. As of June 2014, Agencies have committed to action in one specific area: streamlining the measurement of results and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/news-events/ihp-news/article/global-health-agency-leaders-take-steps-towards-a-common-set-of-health-indicators-327655/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Principles of the IHP+ ==
Improving health and health services involves governments, health workers, civil society, parliamentarians and other stakeholders working together. In developing countries, money for health comes from both domestic and external resources. This means that governments must also work with a range of international development partners. These partners are increasing in number, use different funding streams and have diverse bureaucratic demands. As a result, development efforts can become fragmented and resources can be wasted.

In 2005, the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]] set out principles for making aid more effective. These principles include ownership, alignment, harmonization, mutual accountability and managing for results. In 2011, the Busan High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness signaled a shift in thinking from traditional aid effectiveness to a broader, more inclusive approach to development cooperation, a greater emphasis on considering domestic and external resources together, and on results.

IHP+ began in September 2007 in order to put these international principles into practice in the health sector and accelerate progress towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-09-06/britain-launches-global-healthcare-plan-for-poor/661550?section=world "Britain launches global healthcare plan for poor countries"], [[ABC News (Australia)]], September 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200709051541.htm "Brown launches global health plan"], [[Associated Press]] in ''[[The Hindu]]'', September 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Ramakant, [http://www.asiantribune.com/node/7329 "International Health Partnership to strengthen health systems"], ''[[Asian Tribune]]'', September 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has worked to encourage more inclusive national health planning and joint assessment (JANS) processes, more unified support to national plans through country compacts, one monitoring &amp; evaluation platform to track strategy implementation, greater mutual accountability, improved civil society engagement and financial management harmonization and alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== IHP+ Partners ==
IHP+ has partners from around the world including developing countries, civil society organizations (CSOs) and development partners. Originally, 26 signatories including 7 countries, 18 bilateral and multilateral partners, and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] signed the IHP+ [[Pact|Global Compact]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/CMS_files/documents/ihp_global_compact_EN.pdf PDF signed version from the Global Compact]&lt;/ref&gt; for achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals. The Global Compact is the initiative's foundational global document that is signed by all partner countries, international agencies and bilateral donors when they join the IHP+. The Compact sets out the goals and approach of IHP+ and contains collective and individual commitments by signatories to adhere to agreed aid effectiveness principles. Signatories agree to support country and government-led national health plans. Currently, there are 63 signatories to the Global Compact (as of June 2014).

[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/CSO/0,,contentMDK:20127718~menuPK:288622~pagePK:220503~piPK:220476~theSitePK:228717,00.html Civil Society Organizations] (CSOs) play an important role in IHP+ at both the country and global level. At the country level, civil society encompasses patient groups, health workers, medical or health unions and associations, faith-based organizations, [[non-governmental organization]]s, community-based organizations, academic institutions, media, advocacy groups, refugees, women, youth and other neglected or vulnerable groups. At the global level, civil society is included in IHP+ governance bodies. The IHP+ Steering Committee and Reference Group each include one northern and one southern civil society representative, who draw on a Civil Society Consultative Group of up to 12 civil society members, to discuss IHP+ related issues and activities. IHP+ thematic working groups also include civil society representation. IHP+ supports a small grants programme for southern CSOs called the [http://www.healthpolicyactionfund.org/ Health Policy Action Fund]. This is designed to strengthen the capacity of southern CSOs so that they can engage more meaningfully with national health policy processes.

In addition, IHP+ collaborates with related initiatives including Harmonization for Health in Africa (HHA); the Global Health Workforce Alliance (GHWA); H8;&lt;ref&gt;H8 stands for Health eight, an informal gathering of eight international agencies coming together to improve their effectiveness in providing health in Low and Middle Income Countries.Composed of the [[WHO]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNFPA]], [[UNAIDS]], [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], [[GAVI Alliance]], [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], and the [[World Bank]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health Metrics Network]] (HMN); Providing for Health (P4H); and follow-up activities of the Commission for Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health (COIA).

==Key Issues==
IHP+ encourages inclusive ways of working, and governments, CSOs, private organizations, parliaments and international development partners all have a role to play in the process. IHP+ works in six key areas to change the way we work together in countries: 
* Inclusive health planning and joint assessment (JANS) processes.  [http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/key-issues/national-health-planning-jans/ JANS] is a shared, systematic approach to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a national health strategy.
* Country compacts. These are negotiated agreements in which governments and development partners make commitments on ways to support implementation of a national health strategy. Compacts include agreements on aid modalities, and management and monitoring arrangements.
* Harmonization with and alignment to country financial management systems. Joint Financial Management Assessments and Joint Fiduciary Arrangements are useful tools for strengthening &amp; aligning with government systems and reducing transaction costs. These also help to improve the use of scarce resources and increase transparency and accountability.
* Monitoring &amp; Evaluation. IHP+ supports the development of one common country platform to monitor and review the implementation of a national health strategy. 
* Mutual Accountability. Building stronger health systems means holding each other to account for decisions and actions. IHP+ encourages greater mutual accountability by monitoring progress on partners' commitments. The [http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/tools/ihpresults-survey-tool/ IHP+ results] monitors progress on commitments made, with indicators based on the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]].
* Civil society engagement. CSOs are crucial partners in countries and at the global level. They make important contributions to planning, implementing and monitoring national health strategies.

IHP+ also works to enable greater south-south knowledge exchange. Experience of working with multiple partners to deliver better results is growing. IHP+ is fostering more systematic approaches to learning with and across countries, through existing networks where possible.

Based at [[Western Michigan University]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/humfig/11217607.0001.204/--politics-in-a-world-of-civilizations-long-term-perspectives?rgn=main;view=fulltext| title=Politics in a World of Civilizations: Long-term Perspectives on Relations between Peoples|author=Brett Bowden|publisher=''Human Figurations: Long-term Perspectives on the Human Condition'', Volume 1, Issue 2|date=July 2012|accessdate=August 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ISCSC holds an annual conference and publishes the journal ''[[Comparative Civilizations Review]]''.

==Brief history==
In October 1961, in Salzburg, Austria, an extraordinary group of scholars gathered to create the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations. Among the 26 founding members from Austria, Germany, France, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Spain, Italy, England, Russia, the United States, China and Japan were such luminaries as Pitirim Sorokin and Arnold Toynbee.  For six days, the participants debated such topics as the definition of “civilization,” problems in the analysis of complex cultures, civilizational encounters in the past, the Orient versus the Occident, problems of universal history, theories of historiography, and the role of the “human sciences” in “globalization.”  The meeting was funded by the Austrian government, in cooperation with UNESCO, and received considerable press coverage.  Sorokin was elected the Society’s first president.  After several meetings in Europe, the advancing age of its founding members and the declining health of then president, Othmar F. Anderle, were important factors in the decision to transfer the Society to the United States.   Between 1968 and 1970 Roger Williams Wescott of Drew University facilitated that transition.  In 1971, the first annual meeting of the ISCSC (US) was held in Philadelphia.  Important participants in that meeting and in the Society’s activities during the next years included Benjamin Nelson (the Society’s first American president), Roger Wescott, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, David Wilkinson, Rushton Coulborn and C.P. Wolf.  In 1974, the Salzburg branch was formally dissolved, and from that year to the present there has been only one International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations (ISCSC). 

	The presidents of the ISCSC are, in order: In Europe, Pitirim Sorokin and Othmar Anderle; in the United States, Benjamin Nelson, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, Michael Palencia-Roth, Roger Wescott, Shuntaro Ito (from Japan), Wayne Bledsoe, Lee Daniel Snyder, Andrew Targowski, David Rosner and the current president Toby Huff.  To date, the Society has held 46 meetings, most of them in the United States but also in Salzburg, Austria; Santo Domingo, The Dominican Republic; Dublin, Ireland; Chiba, Japan; Frenchman’s Cove, Jamaica; St. Petersburg, Russia; Paris, France; New Brunswick, Canada; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  More than 30 countries are represented in the Society’s membership.  Its intellectual dynamism and vibrancy over the years have been maintained and enhanced through its annual meetings, its publications, and the participation of such scholars as Talcott Parsons, Hayden White, Immanuel Wallerstein, Gordon Hewes, André Gunder Frank, Marshall Sahlins, Lynn White Jr., and Jeremy Sabloff.  The Society is committed to the idea that complex civilizational problems can best be approached through multidisciplinary analyses and debate by scholars from a variety of fields.  The Comparative Civilizations Review, which welcomes submissions from the Society’s members as well as other scholars, has been published continually since its inaugural issue in 1979.

==Activities==
The ISCSC is a multidisciplinary scholarly organization that has connections with comparative studies programs throughout the world. The society holds an annual conference, often with the cooperation of other scholarly organizations based in the conference locale. One example of this is the 1998 conference held at [[Reitaku University]] in Japan together with the Japan Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations; the two organizations continue to have a close relationship.

The ISCSC publishes the bi-annual ''''Comparative Civilizations Review'''', a peer-reviewed journal. The blog Civilitas: https://civilitasblog.blogspot.com/ has been active since 2011.

[[File:IKRK Hauptquartier.jpg|thumb|The [[headquarters]] of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. [[Geneva]] ([[Switzerland]]) is the city that hosts the highest number of international organizations in the [[world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} François Modoux, "La Suisse engagera 300 millions pour rénover le Palais des Nations", ''[[Le Temps]]'', Friday 28 June 2013, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An '''international organization''' is an [[organization]] with an [[international]] membership, scope, or presence.  There are two main types:&lt;ref&gt;The ''Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' divides modern international organizations into two "basic types, the 'public' variety known as intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and the 'private' variety, the international non-governmental organization (INGOs)." (Evans, Graham, and Richard Newnham. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hUACAAAACAAJ Penguin Dictionary of International Relations]''. Penguin, 1998, p. 270.)&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[International nongovernmental organization]]s (INGOs): [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) that operate internationally. These include international [[non-profit organization]]s and worldwide companies such as the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]].
* [[Intergovernmental organization]]s, also known as international governmental organizations (IGOs): the type of organization most closely associated with the term 'international organization', these are organizations that are made up primarily of [[sovereign state]]s (referred to as [[member state]]s).  Notable examples include the [[United Nations]] (UN), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), [[Council of Europe]] (COE), [[International Labour  Organization]] (ILO) and [[Interpol|International Police Organization]] (INTERPOL).  The UN has used the term "intergovernmental organization" instead of "international organization" for clarity.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.un.org/members/intergovorg.shtml Intergovernmental organizations having received a standing invitation to participate as observers in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly and maintaining permanent offices at Headquarters]." United Nations Department of Public Information, [[United Nations Secretariat]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and oldest intergovernmental organization is the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]], created in 1815 by the [[Congress of Vienna]].

The role of international organizations is helping to set the international agenda, mediating [[political bargaining]], providing a place for political initiatives and acting as catalysts for coalition- formation. International organizations also define the salient issues and decide which issues can be grouped together, thus help governmental priority determination or other governmental arrangements.

Not all international organizations seek economic, political and social cooperation and integration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19637">[[File:Voice of Turkey Interval Signal.ogg|thumb|The interval signal of [[Voice of Turkey]] as heard in 2013.]]
An '''interval signal''', or '''tuning signal''', is a characteristic sound or musical phrase used in [[international broadcasting]], [[numbers stations]], and by some domestic broadcasters, played before commencement or during breaks in transmission, but most commonly between programmes in different languages. It serves several purposes:
* It assists a listener to tune his or her radio to the correct frequency of the station. This is because most older and cheaper radio receivers do not have digital frequency readout.
* It informs other stations that the frequency is in use.
* It serves as a station identifier even if the language used in the subsequent broadcast is not one the listener understands.

The practice began in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s and was carried over into [[shortwave]] broadcasts.  The use of interval signals has declined with the advent of digital tuning systems, but has not vanished. Interval signals were not required on commercial channels in the USA, where jingles were used as identification.

Reports regarding the '''longest recorded sniper kills''' that contain information regarding the shooting distance and the identity of the sniper have been presented to the general public since 1967. Snipers in modern warfare have had a substantial history following the development of long distance weaponry. As weapons, ammunition, and aids to determine [[Ballistics|ballistic]] solutions improved, so too did the distance from which a kill could be targeted. In mid-2017 it was reported that an unnamed Canadian special forces operator, based in Iraq, had set a new record of {{convert|3540|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}, beating the record previously held by British Corporal Craig Harrison at 2,475 m (2,707 yd).&lt;ref name= "Fife p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Fife|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Murphy p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Bunch p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Bunch|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kalvapallé|first1=Rahul|title=Small but mighty: How Canada’s military produces some of the world’s best snipers|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3552281/snipers-canadian-military/|accessdate=June 24, 2017|publisher=Global News|date=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sniper technology==
Although technology such as electronics have improved, optical equipment such as rangefinders and ballistic calculators have eliminated manual mathematical calculations to determine elevation and windage, the fundamentals of accurate and precise long-range shooting remain largely the same since the early history of shooting, and the skill and training of the shooter and the shooter's spotter where applicable are the primary factors. Accuracy and precision of ammunition and firearms are also still reliant primarily on human factors and attention to detail in the complex process of producing maximum performance.

The modern method of long-distance sniping (shots over {{Convert|1,100|meters|mi|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}) requires intense training and practice. A sniper must have the ability to accurately estimate the various factors that influence a [[bullet]]'s [[external ballistics|trajectory and point of impact]], such as the shooter's distance from the target, wind direction, wind speed, [[air density]], elevation, and even the [[Coriolis effect]] due to the rotation of the Earth. Mistakes in estimation compound over distance and can cause a shot to only injure, or to miss completely.&lt;ref name="Plaster p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Plaster|1993|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any given combination of firearm and ammunition will have an associated value, known as the [[circular error probable]] (CEP), defined as the radius of a circle whose boundary is expected to contain the impact points of half of the rounds fired.&lt;ref&gt;"Circular Error Probable (CEP)," Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center Technical Paper 6, Ver 2, July 1987, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

If the shooter wishes to improve accuracy and precision, wishes to increase range or wishes to do all of these things, the accuracy of "estimates" of external factors must improve accordingly. At extreme ranges, extremely accurate "estimates" are required and even with the most accurate estimates, hitting the target becomes subject to uncontrollable factors. For example, a rifle capable of firing a 1/2 MOA (approximately 1/2" center to center of the two holes furthest apart) 5-round group (often referred to as "grouping") at 100 yards will fire a theoretical 12.5" group at 2,500 yards. Unless the group is centered perfectly on the target at 100 yards, the 2,500-yard group will be centered 25 times the off-center error at 100 yards. This example ignores all other factors and assumes "perfect" no-wind shooting conditions and identical muzzle velocities and ballistic performance for each shot.

USMC Gunnery Sergeant [[Carlos Hathcock]]'s confirmed {{Convert|2,500|yd|meters|abbr=on}} kill in the Vietnam War was primarily due to the enemy soldier stopping his bicycle on the spot Hathcock had fired at while sighting in his Browning M2 heavy machine-gun.

Devices such as [[laser rangefinder]]s, handheld meteorological measuring equipment, handheld computers, and ballistic-prediction software can contribute to increased accuracy (i.e. reduced CEP), although they rely on proper use and training to realize any advantages. In addition, as instruments of measure, they are subject to accuracy errors and malfunction. Handheld meteorological instruments only measure conditions at the location they are used. Wind direction and speed can vary dramatically along the path of the bullet.

==History==
The science of long-range sniping came to fruition in the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Carlos Hathcock]] held the record from 1967 to 2002 at {{convert|2286|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Scott p. 181"&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2003|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He recorded 93 official kills.&lt;ref name="Gaijinass"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= May 6, 2010|url = http://gaijinass.wordpress.com/2010/05/06/1655/|title = The way of the Gun: USMC S/S|publisher = Gaijinass.com| accessdate = May 6, 2010 | last=Gaijinass| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the U.S., Hathcock helped to establish the Marine Corps [[Scout Sniper]] School at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico|Quantico, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Scott p. 283"&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2003|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his success as a USMC scout-sniper during multiple deployments to Vietnam, Gunnery Sergeant Hathcock competed in multiple USMC shooting teams. Hathcock also won the 1966 Wimbledon Cup, which is earned by the winner of the U.S. 1,000-yard high-powered rifle National Championship. Even after being severely burned during an attack on an [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|Amtrac]] on which he was riding and his efforts to rescue other soldiers, and after being diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]], Hathcock continued to serve, shoot and instruct.

Hathcock's record stood until Canadian sniper [[Arron Perry]] of the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] exceeded it with a shot of {{Convert|2,310|meters|yd|abbr=on}}. Perry held the title for only a few days, as another man in his unit (Corporal [[Rob Furlong]]) beat Perry's distance with a {{convert|2430|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} shot in March 2002. Perry and Furlong were part of a six-man sniper team during 2002's [[Operation Anaconda]], part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|War in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Global"/&gt;

Corporal Furlong's record was bested by a British soldier, [[Craig Harrison (sniper)|Corporal of Horse Craig Harrison]], of the Blues and Royals, [[Household Cavalry]], who recorded two {{convert|2475|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} shots (confirmed by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) in November 2009, also during the War in Afghanistan, in which he hit two Taliban insurgents consecutively.&lt;ref name="Smith p." /&gt; Harrison killed the two Taliban machine gunners with shots that took the 8.59&amp;nbsp;mm rounds almost five seconds to hit their targets, which were {{Convert|900|meters|yd|abbr=on}} beyond the L115A3 sniper rifle’s recommended range. A third shot took out the insurgents' machine gun. The rifle used was made by [[Accuracy International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/defence/10762782/Accuracy-International-the-gun-maker-of-choice-for-Britains-elite-marksmen.html|title=The company behind the rifle used by the world's deadliest sniper|last=Tovey|first=Alan|date=2 February 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, an unnamed sniper from Canada's Tier 1 special forces unit, [[Joint Task Force 2]], surpassed the 2009 record by over {{convert|1,000|meters|yd|abbr=on}}, with a {{convert|3540|meters|yd|0|abbr=on}} shot in the 
[[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi Civil War]]. As with the previous two Canadian records, a [[McMillan Tac-50]] with [[Hornady|Hornady A-MAX .50 (.50 BMG)]] ammunition was used.&lt;ref name= "Fife p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Murphy p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Bunch p. "/&gt;

==Confirmed kills {{convert|1250|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} or greater==
This list is not exhaustive, as such data is generally not tracked nor managed under any official procedure. For example, the [[Canadian Army]] 2002 sniper team that saw two soldiers ([[Arron Perry]]/2,310 m and [[Rob Furlong]]/2,430 m) set consecutive new records, also made a number of kills at {{Convert|1,500|meter|yd|abbr=on}} that are not counted here.&lt;ref name="Maclean.Furlong"/&gt; The list also shows that, in some cases, an armed force command may choose to withhold the name of the actual sniper for security reasons. The United Nations Security Forces, such as in the Balkans, also had one U.S. sniper (name withheld) attributed with a {{Convert|1,271|meter|yd|abbr=on}} shot.

While not on the list due to the range being less than the minimum distance used to compile it, Hathcock's second-longest confirmed kill was {{convert|1200|yards|m}} using a "standard" USMC sniper rifle chambered in .30-06 Springfield. At the time of Hathcock's service, snipers had essentially been eliminated from the USMC, and its sniper rifles were a hodgepodge mix of commercial [[Remington Model 700|Remington 700]] and [[Winchester Model 70]] rifles chambered for multiple cartridges. The major challenge for Hathcock and other scout-snipers was improving the performance and reliability of their rifles and ammunition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13829">'''MAP International''' is a global Christian health and relief organization that partners with people living in conditions of poverty to save lives and develop healthier families and communities.  Recognized for their 99% efficiency rating, they respond to the needs of those they serve by providing medicines, preventing disease and promoting health to create real hope and lasting change. Their mission is to advance the total health of people living in the world’s poorest communities. They carry out that mission in the broad programmatic areas of community health development, disease prevention and eradication, relief and rehabilitation and global health advocacy.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
'''MAP International was founded as Medical Assistance Programs International''', an organization that provides medical supplies abroad, encourages community health development, prevents disease, and responds to disasters, was founded in 1954 by J. Raymond Knighton, the first Executive director of the [[Christian Medical and Dental Society|Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS)]]. MAP International is a member of [http://www.integralalliance.org Integral], an international cooperation of 19 Christian aid organizations. MAP International’s first project was to supply Shering Corporation and Eli Lilly’s donation of 11 tons of medicines abroad in developing areas. 

=== Disaster relief ===
Since then, MAP International has instituted numerous projects including but not limited to emergency relief efforts after Typhoon Gloria in Taiwan, civilian casualties in Panama, the fall of the Soviet Union, Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, the fall of the Taliban, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2016 Ecuador earthquake, and Zika relief in Latin America. MAP International also started Fellowship programs to train medical students, opened offices in developing areas such as Ecuador, Kenya, and West Africa, and donated billions of dollars in medicines and supplies to people in need.

=== Mission statement ===
MAP's Mission | MAP International is a global Christian health and relief organization that partners with people living in conditions of poverty to save lives and develop healthier families and communities. Recognized for our 99% efficiency rating, we respond to the needs of those we serve by providing medicines, preventing disease and promoting health to create real hope and lasting change. Our mission is to advance the Total Health of people living in the world’s poorest communities. We carry out that mission in the broad programmatic areas of community health development, disease prevention and eradication, relief and rehabilitation and global health advocacy. Although MAP International is a Christian organization, it has a policy against discrimination based on religion, gender, race, and other aspects of an individual’s background, and will not refuse help to anyone based on these classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/content/about-map-guiding-principles|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Credibility ==
MAP International’s status as a highly credible organization is well attested to by multiple well-known sources. [[Forbes|Forbes, Inc.]] recognizes MAP International as the #37 Largest U.S. Charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/map-international/|title=MAP International on the Forbes The 100 Largest U.S. Charities List|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the MAP International program is very well recognized and generates a large amount of revenue. It illuminates important aspects of the program such as its donor dependency, total revenue, amount spent on charitable work, and fundraising efficiency. [[Better Business Bureau|BBB]] lists MAP International as an accredited charity, meaning it meets the standards in terms of governance, measuring effectiveness, finances, and fund raising and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/relief-and-development/map-international-in-brunswick-ga-1681|title=Charity Report - MAP International - give.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charity Navigator]] rates MAP International as 100 out of 100, and four out of four stars, and includes information about the program’s accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4042#.UmNRshbU7lJ|title=Charity Navigator - Rating for MAP International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNBC named MAP International #2 on their list of Top-Ten Charities Changing the World in 2015.  [[POPLINE|Popline]] points out that some health workers have biases against working with faith-based programs, but that the merits of the MAP International program should dispel these biases. It also discusses the financial benefits of FBOs in relation to “their ability to leverage volunteer work with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popline.org/node/241130Green, E. C. (2003, September 24). Faith-based Organization: Contributions to HIV Prevention. Popline.]&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Current projects ==

=== Disaster relief ===
MAP International works to respond to both natural and conflict related emergencies. MAP International provides medical relief shipments to those in need and monitors the health of those in need, if an emergency occurs in a country MAP International has instituted a country presence it implements a country office response in which MAP International staff mobilize to provide health care, and utilizes community based disaster mitigation to train community members to manage the effects of the disaster and promote health in the wake of the disaster on a long-term scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//DISASTER%20RELIEF%20FINAL.pdf (2013). Global Program Scope. Map International.]&lt;/ref&gt; Current MAP International disaster relief programs include Typhoon Haiyan: Philippines, Cyclone Phailin, Oklahoma Tornado, and Syrian Refugee relief. MAP International has responded to Typhoon Haiyan by shipping $4.2 million in medicines and supplies, and is still in the process of responding by providing emergency health care kits to victims. MAP International recognizes its partners for their integral role in efficiently distributing donated medicines and supplies, and states the difficulties they have encountered in getting the medicines to the victims. For example, all of the medicine shipments in Leyte Island were washed away when the typhoon hit that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/content/emergency-response/568/typhoon_haiyan_map_is_responding|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the detrimental effects of Cyclone Phailin, MAP International is providing India with temporary shelter structures, food, medicine, and cooking utensils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/emergency-response/499/cyclone_phailin_hits_india|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAP International has responded to the Oklahoma Tornado by donating over $127,000 of supplies to their partner, Convoy of Hope, in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/oklahoma-relief|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation also mentions MAP International's affiliation with Abbott in response to the tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bclc.uschamber.com/site-page/oklahoma-tornadoes-corporate-aid-tracker|title=(2013). Oklahoma Tornadoes--Current Aid Tracker. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the civil war in Syria, MAP International has sent two shipments to refugees, and is still responding by preparing a third shipment to send when sufficient funding is acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/syria-relief|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saporta Report outlines MAP International's involvement in Syrian Refugee Crisis relief efforts, and briefly describes the cost of these emergency aid kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saportareport.com/blog/2013/04/map-international-providing-medical-relief-to-syrian-refugees/|title=MAP International providing medical relief to Syrian refugees  - SaportaReport|date=29 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medicines provided are from the Essential Drug List (EDL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/gems|title=MAP Medical Mission Packs - Medicines for Medical Mission Trips|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maternal and child health ===
MAP International has implemented programs in Ecuador, Uganda, Kenya, and Bolivia. These programs focus on a plethora of different topics including perinatal care, training health promoters, preventing sexual abuse, providing rehabilitation for victims of sexual abuse, and education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//MATERNAL%20AND%20CHILD%20HEALTH%20FINAL.pdf (2013). Global Program Scope. Map International.]&lt;/ref&gt;

MAP International has implemented programs in Kenya, Uganda, Ecuador, Honduras, Bolivia, Indonesia, Liberia, Cote d’Ivore, and Ghana to treat and prevent Guinea worm, Buruli ulcer, Leprosy, Yaws, Lymphatic filariasis, Chagas Disease, Soil-transmitted Helminthes, and Rabies. Programs to eradicate these diseases include vaccinations, education, water and sanitation efforts, awareness building, community mobilization, and operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//NEGLECTED%20TROPICAL%20DISEASES%20FINAL.pdf (2013). Global Program Scope. Map International.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Total health village ===
MAP International has implemented programs in 65 villages throughout Kenya, Uganda, Ecuador, Honduras, Bolivia, Indonesia, Liberia, Cote d’Ivore, and Ghana to encourage and equip underserved communities to come up with their own innovative solutions to the daily challenges they face. This program focuses on local solutions to problems within the cultural context of the community and is designed to give the community command of the improvement plan. Community members take part in many aspects of other current projects listed such as water and sanitation efforts and disease treatment, as well as working to settle conflict, train local health promoters, and facilitate economic security.&lt;ref name="map.org"/&gt;

=== Water and sanitation ===
Water and Sanitation are aspects assimilated into all MAP International programs because of the significant impact they have on preventing disease and promoting other facets of Total Health. Water and Sanitation efforts involve building separate waste and clean drinking structures, providing water filters to communities, and establishing Community Led Total Sanitation programs. MAP International utilizes a [[sweat equity]] design to implement [http://www.sawyer.com Sawyer] water filters in underserved communities and implements a small-scale demonstration with the help of a few members in the community before introducing water sanitation efforts on a large-scale throughout the village. Sawyer attests to the integral role MAP International has played in distributing hundreds water filters to communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sawyer.com/sawyersaves/kenya.html|title=Kenya - Sawyer International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Community Led Total Sanitation programs are designed to educate and empower local community members to make their village a more sanitary and healthy environment through education about the negative health effects of drinking unclean water and the importance of separating human waste structures and drinking water structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//WATER%20AND%20SANITATION%20FINAL.pdf (2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2162">A '''macroregion''' is a geopolitical subdivision that encompasses several traditionally or politically defined regions. The meaning may vary, with the common denominator being cultural, economical, historical or social similarity within a macroregion. The term is often used in the context of [[globalization]].

*It may refer to various kinds of grouping of [[nation state]]s basing on geographical proximity.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Dunning (2000) "Regions, Globalization, and the Knowledge-Based Economy", {{ISBN|0-19-829536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Romania]],  [[Macroregiune|macroregiuni]] ("macroregions") are a higher-level subdivision of the country.
*Sometimes  the [[Greater Region]] of [[Saarland]]-[[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]-[[Luxembourg]] -[[Rhineland-Palatinate]]-[[Wallonia]]-[[French Community of Belgium]]- and [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], which has not found a specific shortcut yet, is called "the macroregion".
*[[Physiographic macroregions of China]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Skinner (ed.) (1977) "The City in Late Imperial China." ''[[Stanford University Press]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Regions of Brazil]] are often referred to as "macroregions", to avoid the confusion of the common word "[[region]]".&lt;ref&gt;p. 100, ''Trade, networks, and hierarchies: modeling regional and interregional economies'', edited by Geoffrey Hewings, Michael Sonis, and David E. Boyce, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|3-540-43087-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Other uses==
The term "macroregion" may be also used in the context of [[natural region]]s, like in [[Slovenia#Natural regions|Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zrc-sazu.si/Zgds/glasgow/9.pdf |format=PDF |title=Modern climate change in Slovenia |accessdate=1 April 2008 |last=Ogrin |first=Darko |date=August 2004 |work=Slovenia: a geographical overview |publisher=Association of the Geographical Societies of Slovenia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820073301/http://www.zrc-sazu.si/zgds/glasgow/9.pdf |archivedate=August 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national '''Museum of World Culture''' ({{lang-sv|Världskulturmuseet}}) opened in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, in 2004. It is a part of the public authority [[Swedish National Museums of World Cultures]] and builds on the collections of the former [[Göteborgs Etnografiska Museum]] that closed down in the year 2000. Its aim is to interpret the subject of [[world culture]] in an interdisciplinary way. The museum is situated next to the [[Universeum]] science centre and the amusement park [[Liseberg]], and close to [[Korsvägen]].&lt;ref name=sfv&gt;{{cite web|title=Världskulturmuseet, Göteborg|url=http://www.sfv.se/sv/fastigheter/sverige/vastra-gotalands-lan-o/varldskulturmuseet-i-goteborg/|website=www.sfv.se|publisher=[[National Property Board of Sweden]]|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"''The museum interprets the concept of world culture in a dynamic and open-ended manner. On the one hand, various cultures are incorporating impulses from each other and becoming more alike. On the other hand, local, national, ethnic and gender differences are shaping much of that process. World culture is not only about communication, reciprocity, and interdependence, but the specificity, concretion and uniqueness of each and every individual.''" (From the background info on the museums homepage.)

The opening exhibitions of the museum were:
* No Name Fever: [[AIDS]] in the age of [[globalization]]
* Horizons: Voices from a global [[Africa]]
* Sister of Dreams: People and [[Mythology|myths]] of the Orinoco
* Fred Wilson: Site unseen - Dwellings of the Demons
* 390 m2 [[Spirituality]]

== Architecture ==
[[Image:Göteborg Museum of World Culture grand stairs.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The grand stairs in the atrium (Fotograf: [[Hélène Binet]])]]
The cement and glass building, located on a slope leading up to the Liseberg amusement park, is graceful, compact and modernistic. Its four-storey glass atrium looks out on mountains and woods.&lt;ref name=sfv /&gt;

The exhibition halls are in the closed part of the building, facing Södra vägen road. The upper storeys hang freely {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} over a footpath. A {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} long section of a display window provides passers-by with a view straight into the largest exhibition hall.&lt;ref name=sfv /&gt;

The architects behind the museum, who were chosen after an international competition, were the French-Cuban-English couple Cécile Brisac and Edgar Gonzalez of Brisac Gonzalez Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of World Culture, Gothenburg|url=http://www.brisacgonzalez.com/projects/mwc/mwc01.html|website=www.brisacgonzalez.com|publisher=Brisac Gonzalez|accessdate=29 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919025144/http://www.brisacgonzalez.com/projects/mwc/mwc01.html|archivedate=19 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In February 2005 the museum decided to remove the painting "[[Scène d'Amour]]" by [[Louzla Darabi]]. The painting was part of a temporary exhibition about [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and depicted a man and a woman having sexual intercourse. The artist and the curator had received numerous death threats from Muslims saddened and frustrated over the [[Koran]] quotations which were featured in a corner of the painting. Some threats were telling the artist to "learn from the Netherlands", referring to the murder of van Gogh and threats against Hirsi Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/index.jsp?a=236913|title=Dödshot stoppar kärlekstavlan |trans-title=Death threat stops love painting|last=Lilja|first=Mats|publisher=[[Expressen]]|website=www.expressen.se|date=3 February 2005|language=Swedish|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State''''' is a 2014 non-fiction book by American investigative journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden’s Story, Behind the Scenes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/books/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on May 13, 2014 through [[Metropolitan Books]] and details Greenwald's role in the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] as revealed by the former [[National Security Agency]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name='GuardMay1214'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/12/glenn-greenwald-uk-arrest-me-edward-snowden-nsa|title=Glenn Greenwald: 'I don't trust the UK not to arrest me. Their behaviour has been extreme'|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 May 2014|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents from the Snowden archive cited in the book are [http://www.glenngreenwald.net/#BookDocuments freely available online].

==Synopsis==
The book consists of five chapters; Contact, Ten Days in Hong Kong, Collect It All, The Harm of Surveillance, and the Fourth Estate, plus an introduction and an epilogue.
In the introduction Greenwald explains how his background as a blogger on surveillance practices of the American government attracted Edward Snowden's attention, and he summarizes the nature, legality, and evolution of such practices. Greenwald concludes by discussing how a global surveillance network has been created with the assistance of technology companies and the unique role of the internet in human history as a facilitator of such surveillance.

In the body of the book, Greenwald discusses how he became involved with the 2013 global surveillance disclosures. He began by traveling to [[Hong Kong]] to meet Edward Snowden, who had contacted Greenwald as an anonymous source purporting to have evidence of government surveillance. As Greenwald continued to investigate he uncovered more information that he later published, to much controversy. In the book Greenwald also discusses establishment media, which he states will traditionally avoid publishing anything that would put them at odds with the government and as such, are less helpful when it comes to the interests of the general public.

==Reception==
In his review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', law professor [[David D. Cole|David Cole]] called ''No Place to Hide'' an important and illuminating book but wrote, "It would have been more important and illuminating were Greenwald able to acknowledge that the choices we face about regulating surveillance in the modern age are difficult and that there are no simple answers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=David|title=‘No Place to Hide’ by Glenn Greenwald, on the NSA’s sweeping efforts to 'Know it All'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald-on-the-nsas-sweeping-efforts-to-know-it-all/2014/05/12/dfa45dee-d628-11e3-8a78-8fe50322a72c_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' gave a mostly positive review, stating that while the book "doesn’t offer an in-depth portrait of the leaker" it does serve as a good "primer" on "what was at stake when he downloaded the government’s most precious secrets onto a thumb drive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=Why Are You So Fearful, O Ye of Little Faith?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/books/2014/05/glenn_greenwald_s_book_no_place_to_hide_reviewed.html|work=[[Slate.com]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was positively reviewed by [[Henry Porter (journalist)|Henry Porter]] in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=GuardMay14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/19/no-place-to-hide-review-glenn-greenwald-nsa-gchq-surveillance-edward-snowden-spying|title=No Place to Hide review|author=Henry Porter|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 May 2014|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porter said that he found "reacquainting myself with the details of surveillance and intrusion by America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ was simply shocking. As the stories rolled out last year, there was almost too much to absorb...Greenwald's book is a tough read if you find these things disturbing."&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt; Porter said that reading ''No Place to Hide'' he had wondered "...how we let the spies probe our lives with such inadequate controls, and how on earth we fell for the propaganda that this massive apparatus was there to protect, not control, us."&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt; Critically Porter felt that the book lacked "...a chart or timeline of the major revelations as well as a proper index. And I did feel the argument lost momentum in the middle..." concluding that "...on the whole this is a vigorously executed and important book."&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt; Porter reserved criticism for what he felt was a lack of appreciation by Greenwald of the importance of the efforts of [[Ewen MacAskill]] and his fellow ''Guardian'' writers in bringing the disclosures to publication.&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt;

Glenn Greenwald received the 2014 [[Geschwister-Scholl-Preis]], an annual German literary award, for the German edition of ''No Place to Hide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geschwister-scholl-preis.de/preistraeger_2010-2019/2014/index.php |title=Preisträger 2014: Glenn Greenwald |trans-title=Award recipient 2014: Glenn Greenwald |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=geschwister-scholl-preis.de |publisher=Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels – Landesverband Bayern e.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2056">'''Nomad studies''' ({{lang-ru|Кочевниковедение}}, kochevnikovedenie; {{lang-ru|Номадистика}}, nomadistika) is branch of historical and anthropological studies specialised in cultures and history of [[nomad]] peoples, particularly the [[Eurasian nomads]] and history of the [[Eurasian steppes]]. Studies of the [[Eurasian nomads]] influence the political idea of [[Eurasianism]].

Among notable researchers in that field were [[Lev Gumilyov]], Pyotr Savitskiy, [[Sergei Rudenko]], [[George Vernadsky]], [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], Hara-Davan Erendzhen, [[Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov|Mikhail Artamonov]], and others.

According to Savitskiy, the history of [[Scythian]]s and huns encompasses in general (within historically foreseeable events) over 12 centuries. Savitskiy claims that the nomad culture of Scythians and Huns should be considered as culture of horse and iron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38147">The '''Official Women's Squash World Ranking''' is the official world ranking for women's [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. The ranking is to rate the performance level of female professional squash player. It is also a merit-based method used for determining entry and seeding in women's squash tournaments. The rankings are produced monthly.&lt;ref name="rank&amp;divisor"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://psaworldtour.com/squash/guides/20161005113420_PSATourRuleBook20162017.pdf |title=PSA Tour Rule Book |publisher=PSA |page=41 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current world number one is [[Nour El Sherbini]] of Egypt, who replaced [[Laura Massaro]] in May 2016.

==PSA Ranking Policy==
Players competing in PSA tournaments earn ranking points according to how far they get in the draw. The points available depend on the prize money and the draw size. The monthly rankings (issued on the 1st of the month) are used in selecting entries to tournaments and in determining the seeds.

The total number of points a player earns in a year (52 weeks) is divided by the number of tournaments played (a minimum of eight are required) to give a ranking average. Where a player has played more than 8 tournaments the best scores may be selected (i.e., the lowest are not included).

For example, a player who has competed in 13 events will have selected her best 10 scores, which will be accumulated and divided by 10.

Players competing in [[Professional Squash Association|PSA World Tour]] Events earn ranking points according to the prize money, classification of the event, and the final position in the draw the player reaches.

The '''origins of [[global surveillance]]''' can be traced back to the late 1940s, when the [[UKUSA Agreement]] was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, whose close cooperation eventually culminated in the creation of the global surveillance network, code-named "'''[[ECHELON]]'''", in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nabbali|first=Talitha|author2=Perry, Mark|title=Going for the throat|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|date=March 2004|volume=20|issue=2|pages=84–97|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(04)00018-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364904000184|quote=It wasn't until 1971 that the UKUSA allies began ECHELON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal|1970s Watergate affair]] and a subsequent [[congressional inquiry]] led by Sen. [[Frank Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/preemption/telecoms.html Pre-Emption - The Nsa And The Telecoms | Spying On The Home Front | FRONTLINE | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it was revealed that the NSA, in collaboration with Britain's GCHQ, had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] leaders such as [[Jane Fonda]] and Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Martin |title=No Holiday |url= |location=New York |publisher=Disinformation Company Ltd |isbn=978-1-932857-29-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, a multi-year investigation by the [[European Parliament]] highlighted the NSA's role in [[Industrial espionage|economic espionage]] in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Peggy Becker |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 1999 |title=DEVELOPMENT OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY AND RISK OF ABUSE OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/cache/offonce/home/publications/studies?page=12 |publisher=STOA, European Parliament |page= |docket= |accessdate=November 3, 2013 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for the general public, it was a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents in June 2013 that first revealed the massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic. Most of these were leaked by an ex-contractor, [[Edward Snowden]]. Even so, a number of these older global surveillance programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore]], and [[Tempora]] were referenced in the 2013 release of thousands of documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/07/15/snowden-has-thousands-of-damaging-nsa-documents-says-greenwald/ Snowden has ‘thousands’ of damaging NSA documents, says Greenwald]&lt;/ref&gt; As confirmed by the NSA's director [[Keith B. Alexander]] on September 26, 2013, the NSA collects and stores all phone records of all American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senators: Limit NSA snooping into US phone records|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/senators-limit-nsa-snooping-us-phone-records|work=Associated Press|accessdate=October 15, 2013|quote="Is it the goal of the NSA to collect the phone records of all Americans?" Udall asked at Thursday's hearing.  "Yes, I believe it is in the nation's best interest to put all the phone records into a lockbox that we could search when the nation needs to do it. Yes," Alexander replied.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the data is kept in large storage facilities such as the [[Utah Data Center]], a US$1.5 billion [[megaproject]] referred to by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a "symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Siobhan Gorman|title=Meltdowns Hobble NSA Data Center|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304441404579119490744478398|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=October 19, 2013|quote=The Utah facility, one of the Pentagon's biggest U.S. construction projects, has become a symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess, which gained broad attention in the wake of leaks from NSA contractor Edward Snowden.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|200px|Due to his alleged ties to [[communism]], the German-born physicist [[Albert Einstein]] was placed under surveillance by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) shortly after he [[emigration|emigrated]] to America.

Wartime censorship of communications during the World Wars was paralleled by peacetime decipherment of communications by the [[Black Chamber]] (Cipher Bureau, MI-8), operating with the approval of the [[U.S. State Department]] from 1919 to 1929.&lt;ref name="reutershistory"&gt;{{cite news|title=Factbox: History of mass surveillance in the United States|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/07/us-usa-security-records-factbox-idUSBRE95617O20130607|agency=Reuters|accessdate=August 14, 2013|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 the now-defunct [[Project SHAMROCK]] was created to gather all [[telegraph]]ic data entering into or exiting from the United States.&lt;ref name="reutershistory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=The Center for Cryptologic History |url=http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00015.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040318034627/http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00015.cfm |archivedate=March 18, 2004 |title=The Origins of NSA (NSA.gov) |publisher=Web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major communication companies such as [[Western Union]], [[RCA|RCA Global]] and [[ITT Corporation|ITT World Communications]] actively aided the U.S. government in the latter's attempt to gain access to international message traffic.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epsley-Jones |first1=Katelyn |first2=Christina |last2=Frenzel|title=The Church Committee Hearings &amp; the FISA Court |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/preemption/churchfisa.html |publisher=PBS |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the NSA was officially established.&lt;ref name="reutershistory"/&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the NSA was created in "absolute secrecy" by [[Harry Truman|President Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bamford |first=James |title=The Agency That Could Be Big Brother|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25bamford.html?pagewanted=print|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 14, 2013 |date=December 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks after President Truman took office, he ordered [[Telephone tapping|wiretaps]] on the telephones of [[Thomas Gardiner Corcoran]], a close advisor of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DAVID BURNHAM|title=TRUMAN WIRETAPS ON EX-NEW DEAL AIDE CITED|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/01/us/truman-wiretaps-on-ex-new-deal-aide-cited.html|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=September 18, 2013|date=February 1, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recorded conversations are currently kept at the [[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum]], along with other sensitive documents ([http://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/psf.htm ~233,600 pages]).

Under [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) carried out wide-ranging surveillance of communications and political expression, targeting many well-known speakers such as [[Albert Einstein]],&lt;ref name="einsteinnytimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Details Emerge From the Einstein Files; How the F.B.I.

It enabled the U.S. and the U.K. to exchange "knowledge from operations involving intercepting, decoding and translating foreign communications." The agreement forbade the parties to reveal its existence to any third party.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"/&gt;

By the late 1990s the [[ECHELON]] system was capable of intercepting satellite transmissions, [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) communications (including most Internet traffic), and transmissions carried by microwave. A detailed description of ECHELON was provided by New Zealand journalist [[Nicky Hager]] in his 1996 book "Secret Power". While the existence of ECHELON was denied by some member governments, a report by a committee of the [[European Parliament]] in 2001 confirmed the program's use and warned Europeans about its reach and effects.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;Fiddler, Stephen (July 1, 2013).

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Parliament stated in its report that the term "ECHELON" was used in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicated it was a signals intelligence collection system capable of interception and content inspection of telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic globally. The report to the European Parliament confirmed that this was a "global system for the interception of private and commercial communications."&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

Rise Against Hunger, [http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/wake-county/article129005999.html formerly Stop Hunger Now], is an international hunger relief non-profit organization that coordinates the packaging and distribution of food and other life-changing aid to people in developing nations. Founded in 1998, Rise Against Hunger mobilizes more than 350,000 volunteers each year to package meals for people in need around the globe. Since 2005, Rise Against Hunger has  distributed more than 315,000,000 meals to recipients in 74 countries with a mission to end hunger in our lifetime.
==History==

Rise Against Hunger is an international hunger relief agency that seeks to end global hunger by engaging local volunteers. The organization was formed in 1998 by Ray Buchanan, a United Methodist Minister, and began its meal packaging program in 2005. The organizational mission is stated as "Rise Against Hunger is driven by the vision of a world without hunger. Its mission is to end hunger in our lifetime by providing food and life-changing aid to the world’s most vulnerable and creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources."

==Areas of Focus==
Rise Against Hunger aims to end hunger through four pathways: Nourishing Lives, Responding to Emergencies, Empowering Communities and Growing the Movement. From the implementation of sustainable development community projects to the meal packaging program that utilizes local volunteers, Rise Against Hunger strives to make a global impact on hunger by building resilience, self-sufficiency and empowerment among the world’s most vulnerable populations.   

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/nourishing-lives/ Nourishing Lives]===
Rise Against Hunger supports safety net programs that support nourishment and skills trainings that help the world’s most vulnerable navigate the difficult journey out of poverty. Rise Against Hunger partners with schools in order to promote and incentivize increased attendance. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger works to partner with skills trainings and clinics in order to support adults learning new trades and encourage healthy lifestyles. Rise Against Hunger works to nourish lives through a holistic approach in the development of the most vulnerable populations.

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/responding-to-crisis/ Responding to Emergencies]===
Rise Against Hunger responds to emergencies. In times of floods, droughts or political unrest, to name a few, Rise Against Hunger aims to provide the immediate critical need, food. Access to food, wages and market systems are often destroyed in times of emergency. Rise Against Hunger works with its in-country partner organizations in order to address the immediate needs in the wake of crisis. Each year Rise Against Hunger reserves 10% of its projected meals to respond to crisis situations. Official Rise Against Hunger responses include the 2016 [[Hurricane Matthew]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian conflict]], [[South Sudanese Civil War|South Sudanese conflict]] and [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

In order to create long-term solutions to hunger and poverty, Rise Against Hunger works to empower communities through agricultural and income-generating initiatives. Rise Against Hunger works to increase agriculture production and incomes through programs that promote improved agricultural methods, business skills and market access. Farmers, one of the most food insecure populations in the world, are given access to quality seeds and fertilizers to increase agricultural production and diversify their crops. Rise Against Hunger supports vocational training to help at-risk individuals increase their earning potentials and gain consistent access to food.

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/get-involved/ Growing the Movement]===
Part of Rise Against Hunger’s mission is to create a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources to end hunger. Rise Against Hunger works with volunteer groups from [http://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/local/hearing-the-call-ridgeview-baptist-fights-hunger/article_44250e2a-1cbd-11e7-b13c-db649d8b7886.html communities of faith], [http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Markets/Kraft-Heinz-expands-CSR-to-hunger-sustainability-environment corporations], [http://pilotonline.com/news/local/milestones-virginia-beach--year-old-organizes-fun-run-food/article_17c83b47-0fd8-5c61-b326-1d82310b7202.html schools] and [http://maynard.wickedlocal.com/news/20170320/local-rotary-clubs-pack-meals-for-rise-against-hunger civic clubs] to package meals while developing a greater awareness of hunger-related issues. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger engages its supporters to participate in advocacy activities to work toward changing laws, policies, systems and attitudes to end hunger by 2030.

==Meal packaging program==

The assembly process combines rice, soy, dehydrated vegetables and a micronutrient flavoring mix formulated by [http://www.heinz.com/sustainability/communities/heinz-micronutrient-campaign.aspx Kraft Heinz Company Foundation] that includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals. The cost of each meal varies between 29 and 34 cents. The food has a shelf-life of two years.
Rise Against Hunger provides over 70% of its meals to support transformational development programs such as school lunch programs, vocational training programs, early childhood development programs, orphanages, and medical clinics. Working with these programs helps enhance lives by giving beneficiaries the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty through education, skills development, and healthcare while also receiving much needed nutrition.

==Grant program==

Rise Against Hunger supports partner organizations in developing countries by providing direct financial assistance to support ongoing programs that provide food, medicines or other basic necessities to impoverished populations. This program enables Rise Against Hunger to respond to crises immediately by working with organizations already on the ground. It also supports local economies in developing areas and promotes self-reliance.

'''SINPO''', an [[acronym]] for S'''ignal, Interference, Noise, Propagation, and Overall''', is a Signal Reporting Code used to describe the quality of [[radiotelegraph]] transmissions. SINPFEMO, an acronym for S'''ignal, Interference, Noise, Propagation, frequency of Fading, Modulation, dEpth, and Overall''' is used to describe the quality of [[Radiotelephone|radiotelephony]] transmissions.  SINPFEMO code consists of the SINPO code plus the addition of three letters to describe additional features of radiotelephony transmissions. These codes are defined by ''Recommendation ITU-R Sm.1135, SINPO and SINPFEMO codes''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/sm/R-REC-SM.1135-0-199510-I!!PDF-E.pdf|title=ITU-R Sm.1135, SINPO and SINPFEMO codes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SINPO code is most frequently used in [[reception report]]s written by [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]]. Each letter of the code stands for a specific factor of the signal, and each item is graded on a 1 to 5 scale (where 1 stands for nearly undetectable/severe/unusable and 5 for excellent/nil/extremely strong).

The code originated with the [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] (a predecessor to the ITU-R) in 1951, and was widely used by BBC shortwave listeners to submit signal reports, with many going so far as to mail audio recordings to the BBC's offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Engineering Division Monnograph, Number 43: September 1962|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/archive/pdffiles/monographs/bbc_monograph_43.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SINPO and SINPFEMO are the official signal reporting codes for international civil aviation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Procedures for Air Navigation Services: ICAO Abbreviations and Codes|url=http://www.icao.int/NACC/Documents/Meetings/2014/ECARAIM/REF03-ICAOCodes.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ITU-R.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of the SINPO code can be subjective and may vary from person to person. Not all [[shortwave]] listeners are conversant with the SINPO code and prefer using plain language instead.

==SINPO code explained==

; S ([[Signalling (telecommunication)|Signal]] strength) : The relative strength of the transmission.
; I ([[Interference (communication)|Interference]]) : Interference from other stations on the same or adjacent frequencies (man-made noise).
; N ([[Signal noise|Noise]]) : The amount of atmospheric noise.
; P ([[Radio propagation|Propagation]]) : Whether the signal is steady or fades from time to time.
; O (Overall merit) : An overall score for the listening experience under these conditions.

Each category is rated from 1 to 5 with 1 being 'unusable' or 'severe' and 5 being 'perfect' or 'nil'. MANY raters misunderstand the code and will rate everything either 55555 or 11111 when in reality both extremes are unusual in the extreme.  '55555' essentially means 'perfect reception akin to a local station' while that is occasionally possible, when talking about long-distance short-wave reception, it is almost never the case.

Another common mistake in rating is presenting an 'O' higher than any previously rated element. By definition, a station cannot present 'perfect' reception if there is any Noise or Interference or Fading present. In other words, it is NOT 'perfect local quality' reception if any of those things are present.

==Examples of SINPO code applied==

In responding to a shortwave reception, the SINPO indicates to the transmitting station the overall quality of the reception.

The SINPO code in normal use consists of the 5 rating numbers listed without the letters, as in the examples below:

* '''54554''' – This indicates a relatively clear reception, with only slight interference; however, nothing that would significantly degrade the listening experience.
* '''33433''' – This indicates a signal which is moderately strong, but has more interference, and therefore deterioration of the received signal.

Generally, a SINPO with a code number starting with a 2 or lower would not be worth reporting, unless there is no noise, interference or loss of propagation, since it would be likely the signal would be unintelligible.

Although the original SINPO code established technical specifications for each number (i.e., a number 3 in the P column meant a fixed number of fades per minute), these are rarely adhered to by reporters.  The 'S' meter displays the relative strength of the received RF signal in decibels; however, this should not be used as the sole indication of signal strength, as no two S meters are calibrated exactly alike, and many lower-priced receivers omit the S meter altogether. References to a "SINFO" code may also be found in some literature. In this case, the 'F' stands for Fading, instead of 'P' for Propagation, but the two codes are interchangeable. It was presumed that the average listener would be more familiar with the meaning of "fading" than "propagation". A simple way to ensure the rating applied is useful is to rate the "O" column first based on the intelligibility of the station. If you can understand everything easily, the station will rate a 4 or higher. If you have to work hard, but can understand everything '3' is the appropriate rating. If you cannot understand everything although you put great effort into it, a '2' is appropriate, and if you cannot understand the programming at all '1' is the appropriate rating.

Some listeners may not know how to distinguish between the 'I' which indicates interference from adjacent stations, and the 'N' which describes natural atmospheric or man-made noise; also for some listeners, the rating for 'Propagation' may not be completely understood. As a result of this confusion, many stations suggest the SIO code&amp;nbsp;– a simpler code which makes the limitations noted above not relevant. Despite this, some books and periodicals maintain the SINPO code is the best for DX reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reception Reports: Reporting Code - Writing Useful Reception Reports |url=http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports-codes.html |accessdate=27 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107033211/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports-codes.html |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other people||Stephen Williams (disambiguation)}}
'''Stephen Williams''' (31 March 1908 - 23 November 1994) was a British radio announcer, presenter and producer, and a pioneer of commercial radio for the UK.

Born in London and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a young boy he was already, in his words, a "wireless fanatic": he said, "I was able to listen proudly to the debut of the BBC on 14 November 1922, and from the moment I heard the announcer say "This is 2LO calling, 2LO, the London station of the British Broadcasting Company", I was seized with an ambition to have a job like his."

During his university vacation in 1928 he got a job as announcer on a "broadcasting yacht" sponsored by the Daily Mail newspaper group. This vessel went round the coast of Britain, transmitting music on records and advertisements for the Daily Mail, from just outside territorial waters, an early precursor of the 1960s "pirate radio" ships..

The broadcasting yacht had been the idea of the paper's Circulation and Publicity Director, Valentine Smith, who soon transferred to the Sunday Referee, where he gave Williams a job with the idea of involving the paper in commercial broadcasting. They were soon in contact with Captain [[Leonard F. Plugge]], who was starting the [[International Broadcasting Company]] (IBC).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Williams, "Pioneering commercial radio the D-I-Y way", ''European Journal of Marketing'', October 1987. {{cite web |url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/radionormandie/_private/stepheneng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030903160037/http://www.offshoreechos.com/radionormandie/_private/stepheneng.htm |archivedate=2003-09-03 |df= }} {{ISSN|0309-0566}} 
(journal title and date wrongly cited on web page).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1932, Williams was sent to France to join Max Staniforth at the IBC's new Radio Normandy service, broadcasting to the south of England.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Plomley, ''Days Seemed Longer: Early Years of a Broadcaster'', London, 1980, p.123. {{ISBN|0-413-39730-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings of two commercials read by Stephen Williams on Radio Normandy in 1932 are said to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Street, "Radio For Sale: Sponsored Programming in British Radio during the 1930s", in ''Sound Journal'', Bournemouth University, 1999. [http://www.kent.ac.uk/sdfva/sound-journal/Street19991.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Williams moved on to a rival company to IBC, Radio Publicity, which started broadcasting to the UK from Radio Paris, then a much more powerful station than Radio Normandy, which rapidly gained a large British audience. But French listeners complained that their most popular station was now too dominated by English programmes, so Radio Publicity turned to the newly created [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], where it was able to gain the sole concession for English programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1933 Williams thus became the first English radio presenter in Luxembourg as well as serving as manager of the station.

Shortly before his death in 1994, Williams gave an interview to Roger Bickerton about his work at Radio Luxembourg which was published in ''The Historic Record and AV Collector'', Issues 39,40 and 41, April, June &amp; October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Street, "Recording Technologies and Strategies for British Radio Transmission Before the 2nd World War", in ''Sound Journal'', Bournemouth University, 2002. [http://www.kent.ac.uk/sdfva/sound-journal/street002.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Luxembourg closed down on the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Stephen Williams resumed his duties there when the station restarted in 1946. He left Luxembourg in 1948, and worked until 1975 as a freelance broadcaster.

When, on 1 January 1992, Radio Luxembourg's English service closed down as a terrestrial radio station, the last words heard, "Good luck, good listening ... and goodbye" were spoken by 83-year-old Stephen Williams, who had been the first person ever to say on the air "This is Radio Luxembourg" over 58 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;"Last hours on 208m", aircheck available at playlist No 40 on ''The Station of the Stars: Audio Archive''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was awarded the Order of Merit by the Grand Duke of Luxembourg in 1992.

He collected a large archive of material related to Radio Luxembourg, much of which his widow has donated to the Centre for Luxembourg Studies at Sheffield University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/german/prospectiveu_g/courses/clux.html Department of Germanic Studies, University of Sheffield] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430062114/http://www.shef.ac.uk/german/prospectiveu_g/courses/clux.html |date=2007-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''To Save Humanity''''' is a 2015 collection of 96 essays on [[global health]] from a collection of authors who range from heads of states, movie stars, scientists at leading universities, activists, and [[Nobel Prize]] winners. Each contributor was asked the same question: "What is the single most important thing for the future of global health over the next fifty years?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/137492688|title=To Save Humanity Book Launch Julio Frenk|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was edited by [[Julio Frenk]] and Steven J.

== Reception ==
The [[Global Strategy Lab]] called the collection "unparalleled" and "a primer on the major issues of our time and a blueprint for post-2015 health and development," and featured it in their annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalstrategylab.org/conference|title=Global Health / Global Justice 2015 Conference|website=globalstrategylab.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Impact Fund]] also featured the collection at their conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CemmaM/status/596740585651884032|title=Masha Cemma on Twitter|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Lancet]] described the book as "testimony to the complexity of global health politics," and called it "a reminder that the breadth of individual and institutional engagement with global health cannot be fully captured by one set of global goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=James|date=21 May 2016|title=Voices in global health: present realities, future challenges|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30529-3/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=387|issue=10033|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30529-3|pmid=|access-date=2016-07-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tube Challenge''' is the competition for the fastest time to travel to all [[London Underground]] stations, tracked as a [[Guinness World Record]] since 1960. The goal is to visit all the stations on the system, not necessarily all the lines; participants may connect between stations on foot, or by using other forms of public transport.

{{As of|2016}}, the record for fastest completion was held by Andi James (Finland) and Steve Wilson (UK), who completed the challenge in 15 hours, 45 minutes and 38 seconds on 21 May 2015.&lt;ref name=alwakeel-20160106&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alwakeel|first1=Ramzy|title=Tube challenger reclaims world record for trip around all 270 stations|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/tube-challenger-claws-back-world-record-for-fastest-journey-around-all-270-stations-a3149961.html|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=Evening Standard|date=6 January 2016|quote=270 Tube stops in 15 hours and 45 minutes … Mr Wilson … and Mr James’s new record has taken eight months for Guinness World Records to ratify – the pair actually completed their run in May last year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-travel-to-all-london-underground-stations|title=Fastest time to travel to all London Underground stations|quote=15 hr 45 min 38 sec, and was achieved by Andy James (Finland) and Steve Wilson (UK) in London, UK, on 21 May 2015.|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=11 March 2016|archivedate=4 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083335/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-travel-to-all-london-underground-stations/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first recorded challenge took place in 1959. Although many people have attempted the challenge and held the record since, they have not always been credited in the record books. In the earlier days of the challenge, participants were permitted to use private forms of transport (such as a car or bike) to move between stations. This led to times of less than 16 hours in some earlier records, and Guinness later changed the rules{{when|date=July 2011}} to ban private transport.

The following is a list of record holders that have appeared in the printed edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''. The record did not appear in the book until its eighth edition.

Between the 1960s and 1990s the record regularly appeared in the ''Guinness Book of Records'', initially listed under "Underground Railways – circuit of", but later just under "Railways" and then "Trains".  Since the change of publishing style of the book from the 2001 edition onwards, the record – although frequently broken – has only once appeared in printed form, in the 2008 edition. More recent records have tended to be published online instead. Since the record has not regularly been published in the book, there have been two broad configurations on the system – one for 275 stations, and one for 270 once the East London Line was no longer part of the network.

===275 stations===
On 3 April 2002 Jack Welsby set a new record time for 275 stations by traversing the system in 19 hours, 18 minutes and 45 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-433122-new-record-set-on-the-tube.do|title=New record set on the tube|newspaper=Evening Standard|accessdate=24 July 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305141751/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-433122-new-record-set-on-the-tube.do|archivedate=5 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsby made just one attempt, starting his route at Heathrow and finishing at Amersham.

This time was beaten on 4 May 2004 by [[Geoff Marshall]] and Neil Blake who achieved a new record time of 18 hours 35 minutes and 43 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/every-tube-station-in-18-hours-7235423.html|title=Every Tube station in 18 hours|newspaper=Evening Standard|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their attempt began on the first train out of [[Amersham station|Amersham]] on the Metropolitan Line and ended at [[Upminster station|Upminster]], and it took Guinness World Records four months to ratify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3700658.stm|title=Tube station visit record broken|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 September 2004 | date=29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous attempt had been broadcast on TV as part of ''[[The Tube (2003 TV series)|The Tube]]'' TV series and another attempt had been televised as part of an ITV1 programme ''Metroland: Race Around the Underground'' on 16 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-7231700-going-down-the-tubes.do|title=Going down the tubes|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=17 October 2003|accessdate=27 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429143148/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-7231700-going-down-the-tubes.do|archivedate=29 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this time stood for two years before being beaten by just five seconds, it was not until Håkan Wolgé and Lars Andersson (both from Sweden) set a new record time for 275 stations that it appeared in the ''Guinness World Records'' Book again, in the 2008 edition.&lt;ref name="gbr2008"/&gt; They set a new record of 18 hours, 25 minutes and 3 seconds, on 26 September 2006.

===270 stations===
Changes to the total number of stations meant that the record was 'reset' and broken three more times over a two-year period until Wood Lane station opened in October 2008, and the network settled at 270 stations.

The first holders of the 270-station record were Andi James, Martin Hazel and Steve Wilson who, on 14 December 2009, achieved a record time of 16 hours, 44 minutes and 16 seconds.&lt;ref name=Southwest&gt;{{Cite news|title = Richard's going underground on charity mission|quote = ''[will] attempt to dethrone Andi James, Martin Hazel and Steve Wilson who set the benchmark on December 14, 2009.''|publisher = This Is Plymouth|date = 4 February 2010|url = http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/Richard-s-going-underground-charity-mission/story-11837754-detail/story.html|accessdate = 12 July 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120614040236/http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/Richard-s-going-underground-charity-mission/story-11837754-detail/story.html|archivedate = 14 June 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TfL used this route four years later as part of the Art on the Underground [[labyrinth]] project to mark the 150th anniversary of the [[London Underground]], installing permanent designs at stations in the same order that the world record route had taken, and later appeared in an ''Information Capital'' article.&lt;ref name="James-Wilson-Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Telegraph|title=How to do the Tube Challenge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11174269/How-to-do-the-Tube-Challenge.html|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record remained unbeaten for 17 months, until Marc Gawley from Denton, Greater Manchester, set a new time of 16 hours, 29 minutes and 57 seconds on 21 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|title=New world record for Denton man who travelled to all 270 London tube stations in under 17 hours|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1425496_new-world-record-for-denton-man-who-travelled-to-all-270-london-tube-stations-in-under-17-hours|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a fast marathon runner, he revealed that he did not use any buses on the day, preferring instead to make all his connections on foot. Gawley's record was beaten 37 days later, when James and Wilson completed the challenge in just 44 seconds under Gawley's time, setting a new record of 16 hours, 29 minutes and 13 seconds on 27 May 2011.&lt;ref name="James-Wilson-Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2013"/&gt;

This record stood for over two years until August 2013, before being broken by previous record holder [[Geoff Marshall]] who along with Anthony Smith, completed the challenge in 16 hours, 20 minutes and 27 seconds,&lt;ref name="bbc2013"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=London Tube Station Visiting Record Broken|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24203949|accessdate=23 September 2013 |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Londonist|title=New world record for Tube Challenges|url=http://londonist.com/2013/09/new-world-record-for-tube-challenge.php|accessdate=23 September 2013 |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the record time was then published for the first time in seven years in the ''Guinness World Records'' in the 2015 edition.&lt;ref name="gbr2015"/&gt;

Clive Burgess and Ronan McDonald set a new Guinness world record time of 16 hours, 14 minutes and 10 seconds on 21 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Brighton Argus|title=For the record, world was enthusiats's Oyster card|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/12901532.For_the_record__world_was_enthusiast___s_Oyster__card_/|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was broken later that year, on 21 May, by previous record holders Andi James and Steve Wilson, in a time of 15 hours 45 minutes 38 seconds.&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords.com"/&gt;

==Other attempts==

Attempts to travel the network have been linked to charities such as Children in Need&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wear/hi/front_page/newsid_9184000/9184337.stm|title=Pudsey Challenge 2010|publisher=BBC Sunderland|date = 12 November 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/local/going_underground_1_2769466|title=Going Underground|newspaper=Sunderland Echo|date = 26 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Comic Relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesthegill.blogspot.com/2009/03/red-nose-day-tube-challenge-2009.html|title=Aiming to misbehave|date = 14 March 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A charity attempt known as "Tube Relief" was organised, following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], to raise money for the [[London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund]]. Fifty-one people rode the entire tube network for the day,&lt;ref name="Tube challenge for bomb charity"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4180368.stm |title=Tube challenge for bomb charity|publisher=BBC News |date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising over £10,000 towards the official charity fund. A [[Sue Ryder (charity)|Sue Ryder]] charity event took place in November 2011, when ten teams competed against each other to have their photo taken outside as many of the 270 stations as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.purplefrog.co.uk/2011/11/visiting-270-london-underground-stations-in-1-day/|title=Visiting 270 London Underground stations in one day|publisher=Purple Frog|date=14 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424125549/http://www.purplefrog.co.uk/2011/11/visiting-270-london-underground-stations-in-1-day|archivedate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former record holder [[Geoff Marshall]] subsequently organised a mass-participant event in 2014, called "Walk The Tube", which has become an annual event, raising tens of thousands of pounds in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geofftech.co.uk/tube/tube26.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1OF9dSMD4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal jurisdiction''' allows [[Sovereign state|state]]s or [[international organization]]s to claim criminal [[jurisdiction]] over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of [[Residency (domicile)|residence]], or any other relation with the prosecuting entity. Crimes prosecuted under universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all, too serious to tolerate [[jurisdictional arbitrage]]. &lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;

The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that some international norms are ''[[erga omnes]]'', or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of ''[[jus cogens]]'' – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states.&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lyal S.

According to [[Amnesty International]], a proponent of universal jurisdiction, certain crimes pose so serious a threat to the international community as a whole that states have a logical and moral duty to prosecute an individual responsible; therefore, no place should be a safe haven for those who have committed [[genocide]],&lt;ref&gt;The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, "Brief Primer on Genocide" Accessed at {{cite web|url=http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction%3Dpage.viewpage%26pageid%3D1638 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619091806/http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=1638 |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]], [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[war crime]]s, [[torture]] and [[forced disappearance]]s.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/020/2001/en/|title=UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION: Questions and answers|access-date=6 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''Commentaries on the Roman Law'', Book I, Chapter I, "De Jure Gentium et Civili".&lt;/ref&gt; says that "All nations ... are governed partly by their own particular laws, and partly by those laws which are common to all, [those that] natural Reason appoints for all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Maine| first =Sir Henry Sumner| title =Ancient Law: Its Connection With the Early History of Society and Relation to Modern Ideas| publisher =John Murray| publication-place = London | edition = 1861 first| date =| page = 46| language = | isbn =| url = https://archive.org/stream/ancientlawitsco18maingoog#page/n58/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the classical understanding of universal law accessible by reason, in the seventeenth century, the Dutch jurist [[Grotius]] laid the foundations for universal jurisdiction in modern international law, promulgating in his ''De Jure Pradae'' (''Of the Law of Captures'') and later ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''Of the Law of War and Peace'') the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view that there are universal principles of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grotius|authorlink=Grotius |title=[[De Jure Pradae (book)|De Jure Pradæ: (Of the Law of Captures)]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=London |year=1604 |pages=xviii |isbn=}} (discussing in introductory notes Grotius' account of universal principles of right and wrong derived from reason and divine Will, the underpinning of much modern international law).&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, international law came to recognize the analogous concept of ''[[hostes humani generis]]'' ("enemies of the human race"): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public officials should be treated like pirates or outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept.&lt;ref name=HK-2001/&gt; From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Anthony Pagden|title=The Enlightenment, and Why It Still Matters |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |quote= [I]f there does exist some concept of universal justice, if even the most powerful states on occasion feel compelled to abide by the demands of international law, that we owe to the Enlightenment. | url= |isbn=978-1-4000-6068-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable and influential precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century [[Nuremberg Trials]]. U.S. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] then chief prosecutor, famously stated that an [[International Military Tribunal]] enforcing universal principles of right and wrong could prosecute acts without a particular geographic location, Nazi "crimes against the peace of the world"—even if the acts were perfectly legal at the time in Fascist Germany. Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/jackson.html |title=Justice Jackson's Opening statement for the Prosecution |author=Jackson, Robert, U.S. Supreme Court Justice  |date=21 November 1945 |work= Proceedings, Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal|publisher=International Military Tribunal |accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation's laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an international rule of law unbound by national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jack Goldsmith |title=The Shadow of Nuremberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/justice-and-the-enemy-nuremberg-9-11-and-the-trial-of-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-by-william-shawcross-book-review.html |quote=The compromises of 1945 came to be seen as imperfect but essential progress toward international rule of law and the foundation for modern international criminal tribunals. |work=[[New York Times]] |date= January 20, 2012|accessdate=2016-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, even at the time the Nuremberg trials appeared to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Harlan F. Stone|Harlan Fiske Stone]] remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was "conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg. I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Alpheus T. Mason, Harlan Fiske Stone: Pillar of the Law (New York: Viking, 1956), p. 716.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Roth]], the executive director of [[Human Rights Watch]], argues that universal jurisdiction allowed Israel to try [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem in 1961. Roth also argues that clauses in treaties such as the [[Geneva Convention]]s of 1949 and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] of 1984, which requires signatory states to pass [[municipal law]]s that are based on the concept of universal jurisdiction, indicate widespread international acceptance of the concept.&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt;

==Universal distinct from extraterritorial jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction differs from a state's prosecuting crimes under its own laws, whether on its own territory ([[territorial jurisdiction]]) or  abroad ([[extraterritorial jurisdiction]]). As an example, the United States asserts jurisdiction over stateless vessels carrying illicit drugs on international waters—but here the US reaches across national borders to enforce its own law, rather than invoking universal jurisdiction and trans-national standards of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Neil Boister |title=An Introduction to Transnational Criminal Law |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=   | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kElWbHK0JF8C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=us+transnational+criminal+jurisdiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ohc-p-b-Tm&amp;sig=BSde-49gTF84cpZEEwvpzCvEX5U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzt_XlsjLAhWHVh4KHYfrDyAQ6AEIZzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20transnational%20criminal%20jurisdiction&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-960538-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States attempting to police acts committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory tends to be more controversial than a state prosecuting its own citizens wherever they may be found. Bases on which a state might exercise jurisdiction in this way include the following:

*The least controversial basis is that under which a state can exercise jurisdiction over acts that affect the fundamental interests of the state, such as [[espionage|spying]], even if the act was committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory. For example, the Indian [[Information Technology Act 2000]] largely supports the extraterritoriality of the said Act. The law states that a contravention of the Act that affects any computer or computer network situated in India will be punishable by India irrespective of the culprit's location and nationality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;
*Also relatively non-controversial is the ability of a state to try its own nationals for crimes committed abroad. France and some other nations will refuse to [[extradition|extradite]] their own citizens as a matter of law, but will instead try them on their own territory for crimes committed abroad.
*More controversial is the exercise of jurisdiction where the victim of the crime is a national of the state exercising jurisdiction. In the past some states have claimed this jurisdiction (e.g., Mexico, ''Cutting Case'' (1887)), while others have been strongly opposed to it (e.g., the United States, except in cases in which an American citizen is a victim: ''US v Yunis'' (1988)). In more recent years, however, a broad global consensus has emerged in permitting its use in the case of torture, "forced disappearances" or terrorist offences (due in part to it being permitted by the various United Nations conventions on terrorism); but its application in other areas is still highly controversial. For example, former dictator of Chile [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London in 1998, on Spanish judge [[Baltazar Garzon]]'s demand, on charges of human rights abuses, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction but rather on the grounds that some of the victims of the abuses committed in Chile were Spanish citizens. Spain then sought his [[extradition]] from Britain, again, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction, but by invoking the law of the [[European Union]] regarding extradition; and he was finally released on grounds of health. Argentinian [[Alfredo Astiz]]'s sentence is part of this juridical frame.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph and specifically for the quote--&gt;

==International tribunals invoking universal jurisdiction==
[[File:ICC member states world map.png|thumb|States parties to the Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]] (light green means ratification or accession deposited but not yet in force, brown means signed but not yet ratified).]]
Established in [[The Hague]] in 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an international tribunal of general jurisdiction (defined by treaty) to prosecute state-members' citizens for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, as specified by several international agreements, most prominently the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] signed in 1998.  Universal jurisdiction over the crimes enumerated in the Rome Statute was rejected by the signing parties, however universal jurisdiction is what allows the United Nations Security Council to refer specific situations to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&amp;context=bjil&lt;/ref&gt;  This has only happened with Darfur (2005) and Libya (2011).

In addition the United Nations has set up geographically specific courts to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity under a theory of universal jurisdiction, such as the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (1994), and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (1993).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia investigates war crimes that took place in the Balkans in the 1990s.  It convicted former Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karadžić]] on 10 charges relating to directing murders, purges and other abuses against civilians, including genocide in connection with the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica; he was sentenced to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Murphy  |title=U.N. tribunal finds former Bosnia Serb leader guilty of genocide |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/un-tribunal-finds-former-bosnia-serb-leader-guilty-of-genocide/2016/03/24/1a9f1066-f1c9-11e5-85a6-2132cf446d0a_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_karadzic_11am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory |quote= |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular states invoking universal jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction may be asserted by a particular nation as well as by an international tribunal. The result is the same: individuals become answerable for crimes defined and prosecuted regardless of where they live, or where the conduct occurred; crimes said to be so grievous as to be universally condemned.

Amnesty International argues that since the end of the Second World War over fifteen states have conducted investigations, commenced prosecutions and completed trials based on universal jurisdiction for the crimes or arrested people with a view to extraditing the persons to a state seeking to prosecute them. These states include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, [[Israel]], Mexico, Netherlands, [[Senegal]], Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"/&gt;  Amnesty writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; All states parties to the [[UN Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]] and the [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture|Inter-American Convention]] are obliged whenever a person suspected of torture is found in their territory to submit the case to their prosecuting authorities for the purposes of prosecution, or to extradite that person. In addition, it is now widely recognized that states, even those that are not states parties to these treaties, may exercise universal jurisdiction over torture under customary international law.&lt;ref name=AI-UJ&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/012/2001/en/?OpenDocument Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and implement legislation – Chapter Nine (Torture: The legal basis for universal jurisdiction)], [[Amnesty International]] 1 September 2001. Section II. Universal Jurisdiction over torture &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of particular states invoking universal jurisdiction are Israel's prosecution of Eichmann in 1961 (see {{section link||Israel}} below) and Spain's prosecution of South American dictators and torturers (see {{section link||Spain}} below).  More recently, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former US President [[George W. Bush]] on behalf of persons tortured in US detention camps, invoking the universal jurisdiction doctrine. Bush cancelled his trip to Switzerland after news of the planned prosecution came to light. Bush has traveled to Canada but the Canadian government shut down the prosecution in advance of his arrest.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"&gt;{{cite news |author=Matt Eisenbrandt |author2=Katherine Gallagher |title=Halting Canadian Bush Prosecution Violated International Obligations|url=http://jurist.org/hotline/2012/01/eisenbrandt-gallagher-bush.php |work=[[Jurist]] | quote=Canada disregarded an opportunity to shatter the global impunity Bush enjoys and in so doing violated international law. |date=January 17, 2012  |accessdate=2016-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has filed a grievance with the United Nations for Canada's failure to invoke universal jurisdiction to enforce the [[Convention Against Torture]], a petition on which action is pending.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"/&gt;

==Immunity for state officials==
On 14 February 2002, the International Court of Justice in the [[Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|''ICJ Arrest Warrant Case'']] concluded that state officials may have immunity under international law while serving in office. The court stated that immunity was not granted to state officials for their own benefit, but instead to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective states. The court also stated that when abroad, state officials may enjoy immunity from arrest in another state on criminal charges, including charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=ICJ-PR-020214&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2002/afr379.html|title=ICJ rejects Belgian arrest warrant for foreign ministers of Democratic Republic of Congo|publisher=United Nations Information Service|date=14 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the ICJ qualified its conclusions, saying that state officers "may be subject to criminal proceedings before certain international criminal courts, where they have jurisdiction. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda&amp;nbsp;..., and the future International Criminal Court."&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003-fn6&gt;Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper.

Cites in footnote 6: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium), Judgment, Merits, para. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]], the former president of [[Liberia]], was served with an arrest warrant by the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL) that was set up under the auspices of a treaty that binds only the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003&gt;Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper. ''[http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh110.htm The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor]'', on the website of the [[American Society of International Law]], June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor contested the Special Court's jurisdiction, claiming immunity, but the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded in 2004 that "the sovereign equality of states does not prevent a head of state from being prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal or court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx&lt; |title=Prosecutor v.

David |lastauthoramp=yes |date=31 May 2004 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the question whether a former head of state might have immunity depends on which international court or tribunal endeavors to try him, how the court is constituted, and how it interprets its own mandate.

===Australia===

The High Court of Australia confirmed the authority of the Australian Parliament, under the Australian Constitution, to exercise universal jurisdiction over war crimes in the ''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'' case of 1991.

===Belgium===
In 1993, Belgium's Parliament passed a "law of universal jurisdiction" (sometimes referred to as "Belgium's genocide law"), allowing it to judge people accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. In 2001, four Rwandan citizens were convicted and given sentences from 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for their involvement in 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/french/press/2003/justice02.htm |title=Belgique : Questions et Réponses sur la loi de Compétence Universelle |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rapid succession of cases:
*Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] was accused of involvement in the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] in Lebanon, conducted by a Christian militia;
*Israelis filed a case against [[Yasser Arafat]] on grounds of responsibility for terrorist activity;
*In 2003, Iraqi victims of a [[Gulf War|1991 Bagdad bombing]] pressed charges against [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H.W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]] and [[Dick Cheney]].

Confronted with this sharp increase in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the [[International Court of Justice]] in the case entitled ''[[Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|ICJ Arrest Warrant Case]]''. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002112703/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214.PDF ICJ's decision] See paragraph 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313044438/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/iCOBEframe.htm separate and dissenting opinions]&lt;/ref&gt; such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/121/8128.pdf separate opinion of President Guillaume] at paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020312003750/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214_oda.PDF dissenting opinion of Judge Oda], paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2003, Belgium repealed the law on universal jurisdiction, and introduced a new law on [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] similar to or more restrictive than that of most other European countries. However, some cases that had already started continued. These included those concerning the Rwandan genocide, and complaints filed against the Chadian ex-President [[Hissène Habré]] (dubbed the "African [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm|title=Belgium: Universal Jurisdiction Law Repealed|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, Habré was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes and other human rights violations by a Belgian court. Arrested in [[Senegal]] following requests from Senegalese courts, he was tried and convicted for war crimes by the Special Tribunal in Senegal in 2016 and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html Trial Watch : Hissène Habré] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413081352/http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

To implement the Rome Statute, Canada passed the [[Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act]]. [[Michael Byers (Canadian author)|Michael Byers]], a [[University of British Columbia]] law professor, has argued that these laws go further than the Rome Statute, providing Canadian courts with jurisdiction over acts pre-dating the ICC and occurring in territories outside of ICC member-states; "as a result, anyone who is present in Canada and alleged to have committed genocide, torture ... anywhere, at any time, can be prosecuted [in Canada]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Byers|title=Intent for a Nation|year=2007 |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-1-55365-250-2|page=111 |authorlink=Michael Byers (Canadian author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Finnish high court sentenced a Rwandan preacher to life in jail in 2010 for his participation in Rwanda's genocide in 1994. Francois Bazaramba, 59, moved in 2003 to Finland seeking asylum. Finland allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10294529 | work=BBC News | title=Finland sentences Rwanda preacher to life for genocide | date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the genocide, he was a pastor in the Baptist church in Nyakizu in southern Rwanda. According to Finnish newspaper ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', the court found him guilty of orchestrating deadly attacks, and organising the torching of Tutsi homes. In a statement the court said he had spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and incited "killings through fomenting anger and contempt towards Tutsis". It stated that "The court has found Bazaramba guilty of an offence which without a genocidal intent would be judged as a murder or incitement to murder ... For those crimes, the only possible punishment is life imprisonment." ''Helsingin Sanomat'' reported that he was acquitted of 10 counts of murder and of providing training and acquiring weapons. During the trial, the court heard from 68 witnesses, travelling to Rwanda and Tanzania to hear some testimonies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Germany===
{{Main|Völkerstrafgesetzbuch}}

Germany has implemented the principle of universal jurisdiction for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes into its criminal law through the "'''''Völkerstrafgesetzbuch"''''' or '''''VStGB''''' ("international criminal code", literally "book of the criminal law of peoples"), which implemented the treaty creating the [[International Criminal Court]] into domestic law. The law was passed in 2002 and up to 2014 it has been used once, in the trial of [[Rwanda]]n rebel leader [[Ignace Murwanashyaka]]. In 2015 he was found guilty and sentenced to 13 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://armedgroups-internationallaw.org/2015/09/28/conviction-of-fdlr-leaders-by-german-court/ | title=Conviction of FDLR leaders by German Court | work= Armed Groups and International Law | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/us-tells-armed-group-drc-surrender-military-option|title = US tells armed group in DRC to surrender or face 'military option'|date = 5 Aug 2014|work = |accessdate = 19 Nov 2014|publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Adolf Eichmann}}
The [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]], along with Kenneth Roth,&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt; has cited [[Israel]]'s prosecution of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 as an assertion of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] crimes against Jews, its [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |title=One World |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=114 |isbn=0-300-09686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichmann's defense lawyer argued that Israel did not have jurisdiction on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Attorney General of Israel v. Eichmann |vol=Criminal Case 40/61 |reporter= |court=District Court of Jerusalem |date=1961 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ }} {{citation|title=Transcripts |accessdate=6 February 2013 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |  archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061001235018/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |archivedate = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel argued universal jurisdiction based on the "universal character of the crimes in question" and that the crimes committed by Eichmann were not only in violation of Israel law, but were considered "grave offenses against the law of nations itself".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt; It also asserted that the crime of genocide is covered under international customary law. As a supplemental form of jurisdiction, a further argument is made on the basis of protective jurisdiction. Protective jurisdiction is a principle that "provides that states may exercise jurisdiction over aliens who have committed an act abroad which is deemed prejudicial to the security of the particular state concerned".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt;

In November 2011, the [[Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission]] purportedly exercised universal jurisdiction to [[trial in absentia|try and convict ''in absentia'']] former US President [[George W.

===Senegal===

In July 2015, the first trial in Africa of a universal jurisdiction case relating to crimes committed abroad by a foreigner with foreign victims was held in a Senegalese courtroom. The former dictator of [[Chad]], [[Hissène Habré]], denied the legitimacy of the special court set up to try him in Senegal for the deaths of thousands during his rule, but the head of the tribunal, [[Gberdao Gustave Kam]], said he would be compelled to participate.  Mr. Habré's lawyers said he was forced to attend the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture. The case was lauded by [[Human Rights Watch]]. It was also the first time the courts of one country are prosecuting the former ruler of another for alleged human rights crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ex-dictator-of-chad-denies-legitimacy-of-torture-crimes-trial-in-senegal/article25599568/ theglobeandmail.com: "Ex-dictator of Chad denies legitimacy of torture crimes trial in Senegal"], 20 Jul 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

Spanish law recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, as well as any other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009, the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Audiencia Nacional]] under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain reins in crusading judges |publisher=BBC News | date=25 June 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8119920.stm |first=Steve |last=Kingstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.&lt;ref name="The Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news | title=Spanish court ends Israel bombing probe | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7nVX6JkK9c3ofnkBpgD_5eFF84AD9950VPO0 | agency=Associated Press | date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Nobel peace prize]] winner [[Rigoberta Menchú]] brought a case against the [[Guatemala]]n military leadership in a Spanish Court.

On 11 January 2006, the [[Audiencia Nacional|Spanish High Court]] agreed to investigate a case in which seven former Chinese officials, including the former [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] and former [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]] were alleged to have participated in a genocide in [[Tibet]].

===United States===
While the United States has no formal statute authorizing it, in some cases the Federal government has exercised [[self-help (law)|self-help]] in apprehending or killing persons suspected of conspiring to commit crimes within the United States from outside of the country, or committing crimes against U.S officials outside of the United States. This has occurred even when the suspect is not a U.S. person, has never been in the United States, and even when the person has never conspired or assisted in the commission of a crime within the United States, there is a functioning government which could try the person for the crime committed there, and notwithstanding the existence of a proper extradition treaty between that country and the United States, ignoring the provisions of the treaty and capturing or killing the person directly.

In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] national, allegedly assisted in the torture and murder of a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the U.S. for a crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and brought him back to the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], in ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially grab him off the street in Mexico ("forcible abduction") to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for false arrest against the government.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''World Radio TV Handbook''''', also known as '''''WRTH''''', is a [[directory (databases)|directory]] of virtually every [[Radio station|radio]] and [[TV station]] on Earth, published yearly. It was started in 1947 by [[Oluf Lund Johansen]] (1891–1975) as the ''World Radio Handbook'' (WRH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oz6gh.byethost33.com/lund_johansen.htm O. Lund-Johansen], presented by OZ6GH.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "TV" was added to the title in 1965, when [[Jens M. Frost]] (1919–1999) took over as editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dswci.org/specials/membersofhonour/jens_frost.html DSWCI Member of Honour:  Jens M. Frost]&lt;/ref&gt; It had then already included data for [[television broadcasting]] for some years. After the 40th edition in 1986, Frost handed over editorship to [[Andrew G. Sennitt|Andrew G. (Andy) Sennitt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agsmedia.nl/body_who.html Andy Sennitt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208225753/http://www.agsmedia.nl/body_who.html |date=2012-02-08 }}, own presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition that bears an edition number is the 4th edition, published in 1949. The three previous editions appear to have been:
* the 1st edition, marked "Winter Ed. 1947" on the cover and completed in November 1947
* the 2nd edition, marked "1948 (May-November)" on the cover and completed in May 1948
* the 3rd edition, marked "1948-49" on the cover and completed in November 1948.

Summer Supplements appear to have been issued from 1959 through 1971. From 1959 through 1966 they were called the Summer Supplement. From 1967 through 1971 they were called the Summer Edition.

Through the 1969 edition, the WRTH indicated the date on which the manuscript was completed.

Issues with covers in Danish are known to have been available for the years 1948 May-November (2d ed.), 1950-51 (5th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), 1952 (6th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), and probably others. The 1952 English ed., which is completely in English, has an extra page with world times and agents, and ads in English which are sometimes different from the ads in the Danish edition. Also, the 1953 ed. mentions the availability of a German edition.

[[Oluf Lund Johansen]] published, in conjunction with [[Libreria Hispanoamericana]] of [[Barcelona]], Spain, a [[softbound]] Spanish-language version of the 1960 WRTH. The book was printed in Spain and called ''Guia Mundial de Radio y Television'', and carried the WRTH logo at the time as well as all the editorial references contained in the English-language version. 

Hardbound editions are known to have been available for the years 1963 through 1966, 1968, 1969, and 1975-1978, and probably others.

[[File:100 m final Berlin 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Usain Bolt]] setting a world record in the 100m dash at the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics]] in Berlin.]]

A '''world record''' is usually the best global performance ever recorded and officially verified in a specific [[skill]] or [[sport]]. The book ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' collates and publishes notable records of all types, from first and best to worst human achievements, to extremes in the natural world and beyond.

== Terminology ==
In the [[United States]] the form '''World's Record''' was formerly more common. The term '''World Best''' was also briefly in use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The latter term is still used in [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] events, including [[track and field]] and [[road running]] to describe good and bad performances not recognized as an official world record: either because it is not an event where the [[IAAF]] tracks the record (e.g. the 150 m run or individual events in a [[decathlon]]), or because it does not fulfil other rigorous criteria of an otherwise qualifying event (e.g. the [[Great North Run]] half-marathon, which has an excessive downhill gradient). The term is also used in video game [[speedrunning]] when someone achieves the fastest possible time for the game and category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speedrunslive - Glossary|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
[[Malaysia]] is one country where world record-breaking has become something of a national fad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.04/capital.html |title = The World Record-Breaking Capital  |accessdate = 2008-09-01 |author = Boulware, Jack |date=April 2006 |publisher = [[Wired Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], the setting and breaking of records is popular: world record [[wikt:registrar|registrar]]s based in India are [[Limca Book of Records]], [[Unique World Records]], World Records India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.worldrecordsindia.com |title = World Records India - Indian Book of World Records  |accessdate = 2015-09-01 |author = Paavan Solanki |date=October 2015 |publisher = worldrecordsindia.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Asia Book of Records]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">The '''world to come''', '''age to come''', and '''heaven on Earth''' are [[eschatological]] phrases reflecting the belief that the [[World (theology)|current world]] or [[Dispensation (period)|current age]] is flawed or [[curse]]d{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and will be replaced in the future by a better world, age, or [[paradise]]. The concept is related to but differs from the concepts of [[heaven]], the [[afterlife]], and the [[Kingdom of God]] in that heaven is another place or state generally seen as above the world, the afterlife is generally an individual's life after death, and the [[Kingdom of God]] could be in the present (such as [[Realized eschatology]]) or the future.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Hindu eschatology==
[[Image:Kalki.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kalki]] with his  white horse]]
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
In Hindu eschatology the current age is the [[Kali Yuga]], a period of decline. [[Kalki]] ('Destroyer of Filth') will appear to purge all evil, beginning a [[golden age]] of [[Satya Yuga]].

There have been a range of dates predicted, purportedly from different methods of calculation.&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;{{cite book|last = Chandra| first = Suresh| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses | publisher = Kindle Edition| date = Aug 15, 2012| location = | pages = | url =   | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri [[Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami]], for example, wrote 400 years ago in his ''Divya Maha Kala Gnana,'' or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Santanu Acharya |url=http://ww-iii.tripod.com/hindu.htm |title=Hindu Prophecies: Translations from the Kalki Purana |publisher=Ww-iii.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of arrival of Kalki has not been consistently asserted by astrologers.&lt;ref name="Chandra"/&gt;

==Jewish eschatology==
[[File:Resurrection of the Dead vision.jpg|thumb|[[Resurrection of the dead]], fresco from the Dura-Europos synagogue]]
[[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|''HaOlam HaBa'']], or "the world to come", is an important part of [[Jewish eschatology]], although [[Judaism]] concentrates on the importance of ''HaOlam HaZeh'' ("this world").  The [[afterlife]] is known as ''Olam haBa'', ''[[Gan Eden#In Jewish eschatology|Gan Eden]]'' (the Heavenly Garden of Eden) and ''[[Gehenna|Gehinom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jews are told to live their lives on earth to the full, as their bodies will stay there but their souls live on. [http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/jewish-afterlife-beliefs.htm Jewish Afterlife Beliefs at SimpleToRemember.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/afterlife.html Afterlife at JewishVirtualLibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba: The Afterlife at JewFAQ.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Talmud]], any non-Jew who lives according to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] is regarded as a ''[[Ger toshav]]'' (righteous gentile), and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian eschatology==
[[Image:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'', an 1887 painting by [[Victor Vasnetsov]]. The [[Lamb of God]] is visible at the top.]]
{{main|Christian eschatology}}
Under [[Christian]] [[eschatology]], the phrase is found in the [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use#1988 ecumenical version .28ELLC.29|Nicene Creed (current Ecumenical version)]]: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-bible.com/Exegesis/creeds.htm |title=The Nicene Creed |publisher=Christian-bible.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]] at {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|18:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|2:5|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|6:5|KJV}}. Other related expressions are "age to come" which is typically found in more recent translations, [[Kingdom of God]], [[Messianic Age]], [[Millennial Age]], [[The New Earth]] and [[New Jerusalem]], and [[dispensation of the fulness of times]] and possibly also [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].

==Zoroastrian eschatology==
In [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[eschatology]], the world to come is the ''[[frashokereti]]'', where the ''[[saoshyant]]'' will bring about a [[resurrection of the dead]] in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a [[last judgment]]. The ''[[yazata]]s'' [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All humankind—both the living and the resurrected dead—will be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous (''[[ashavan]]'') it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to [[hell]], where it will annihilate [[Angra Mainyu]] and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.
