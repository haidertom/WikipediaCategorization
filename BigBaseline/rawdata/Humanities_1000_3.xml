'''Actor–network theory''' ('''ANT''') is a theoretical and methodological approach to [[social theory]] where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationship.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans. ANT holds that social forces do not exist in themselves, and therefore cannot be used to explain social phenomena.  Instead, strictly empirical analysis should be undertaken to "describe" rather than "explain" social activity.  Only after this can one introduce the concept of social forces, and only as an abstract theoretical concept, not something which genuinely exists in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network-theory. Oxford university press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental aim of ANT is to explore how networks are built or assembled and maintained to achieve a specific objective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ulir.ul.ie/handle/10344/2579 Carroll, N., Richardson, I., and Whelan, E. (2012). Service science: an actor-network theory approach. International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation (IJANTTI);4(3), pp. 51-69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpx_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=carroll+A+Bureaucratic+View+of+Public+Service+Innovation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OrMOvhK-8k&amp;sig=YljSfKMKSn1HchgCBBiJYmRnMMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit-ITauIrQAhXDA8AKHbdPBS0Q6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carroll, N.

Actor-Network Theory: A Bureaucratic View of Public Service Innovation, Chapter 7, Technological Advancements and the Impact of Actor-Network Theory, pp. 115-144, Publisher IGI Global, Hershey, PA]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is best known for its controversial insistence on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to act or participate in systems or [[Social network|networks]] or both, ANT is also associated with forceful critiques of conventional and critical sociology. Developed by [[science and technology studies]] (STS) scholars [[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]], the sociologist [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], and others, it can more technically be described as a "material-semiotic" method. This means that it maps relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and [[semiotic]] (between concepts). It assumes that many relations are both material and semiotic.

Broadly speaking, ANT is a [[social constructivism|constructivist]] approach in that it avoids [[essentialist]] explanations of events or innovations (i.e. ANT explains a successful theory by understanding the combinations and interactions of elements that make it successful, rather than saying it is true and the others are false). Likewise, it is not a cohesive theory in itself.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; Rather, ANT functions as a strategy that assists people in being sensitive to terms and the often unexplored assumptions underlying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mol|first=A.|date=2010|title=Actor-Network Theory: sensitive terms and enduring tensions|url=http://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=75bbc661-0a89-475a-9eef-8c8c5a2e9904|journal=Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie. Sonderheft|volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from many other [[science and technology studies|STS]] and sociological [[Social network|network theories]] for its distinct material-semiotic approach.

==Background and context==
ANT was first developed at the [[Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation]] (CSI) of the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]] in the early 1980s by staff ([[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]]) and visitors (including [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]]). The 1984 book co-authored by John Law and fellow-sociologist Peter Lodge (''Science for Social Scientists''; London: Macmillan Press Ltd.) is a good example of early explorations of how the growth and structure of knowledge could be analyzed and interpreted through the interactions of actors and networks.  Initially created in an attempt to understand processes of innovation and knowledge-creation in science and technology, the approach drew on existing work in [[Science and technology studies|STS]], on studies of [[large technical system|large technological systems]], and on a range of French intellectual resources including the semiotics of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], the writing of philosopher [[Michel Serres]], and the [[Annales School]] of history.

ANT appears to reflect many of the preoccupations of French [[post-structuralism]], and in particular a concern with non-foundational and multiple material-semiotic relations. At the same time, it was much more firmly embedded in English-language academic traditions than most post-structuralist-influenced approaches. Its grounding in (predominantly English) [[science and technology studies]] was reflected in an intense commitment to the development of theory through qualitative empirical case-studies. Its links with largely US-originated work on large technical systems were reflected in its willingness to analyse large scale technological developments in an even-handed manner to include political, organizational, legal, technical and scientific factors.

Many of the characteristic ANT tools (including the notions of translation, generalized symmetry and the “heterogeneous network”), together with a [[scientometric]] tool for mapping innovations in science and technology (“co-word analysis”) were initially developed during the 1980s, predominantly in and around the CSI. The “state of the art” of ANT in the late 1980s is well-described in Latour’s 1987 text, ''Science in Action''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;Latour, B. (1987). ''[[Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society]].'' Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1990 onwards, ANT started to become popular as a tool for analysis in a range of fields beyond STS. It was picked up and developed by authors in parts of organizational analysis, informatics, health studies, geography, sociology, anthropology, feminist studies, technical communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Network: Theorizing Knowledge Work in Telecommunications|last=Spinuzzi|first=Clay|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895040|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Read|first=Sarah|last2=Swarts|first2=Jason|date=2015|title=Visualizing and Tracing: Research Methodologies for the Study of Networked, Sociotechnical Activity, Otherwise Known as Knowledge Work|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|pages=14-44|doi=10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economics.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"&gt;Müller, M. and Schurr, C., 2016. Assemblage thinking and actor‐network theory: conjunctions, disjunctions, cross‐fertilisations. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 41(3), pp.217-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2008}}, ANT is a widespread, if controversial, range of material-semiotic approaches for the analysis of heterogeneous relations. In part because of its popularity, it is interpreted and used in a wide range of alternative and sometimes incompatible ways. There is no orthodoxy in current ANT, and different authors use the approach in substantially different ways. Some authors talk of “after-ANT” to refer to “successor projects” blending together different problem-focuses with those of ANT.&lt;ref&gt;John Law and John Hassard (eds) (1999). ''Actor Network Theory and After'' (Oxford and Keele: Blackwell and the Sociological Review).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A material-semiotic method==
Although it is called a “[[Philosophical theory|theory]]”, ANT does not usually explain “why” or "how" a network takes the form that it does.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; Rather, ANT is a way of thoroughly exploring the relational ties within a network (which can be a multitude of different things). As Latour notes,&lt;ref name=technology&gt;Latour, B. (1999). [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/46-TECHNOLOGY-DURABLE-GBpdf.pdf "Technology Is Society Made Durable"]. In Law, J., ed., ''Sociology of Monsters''.&lt;/ref&gt; "explanation does not follow from description; it is description taken that much further." It is not, in other words, a theory "of" anything, but rather a method, or a "how-to book" as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; puts it.

The approach is related to other versions of material-semiotics (notably the work of philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], and feminist scholar [[Donna Haraway]]). It can also be seen as a way of being faithful to the insights of [[ethnomethodology]] and its detailed descriptions of how common activities, habits and procedures sustain themselves.  Similarities between ANT and [[symbolic interactionist]] approaches such as the newer forms of [[grounded theory]] like [[situational analysis]], exist,&lt;ref&gt;Fernback, J., 2007. “Beyond the Diluted Community Concept: A Symbolic Interactionist Perspective on Online Social Relations.” ''New Media &amp; Society'', 9(1), pp.49-69. [[doi:10.1177/1461444807072417]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Latour&lt;ref&gt;Blok, A, &amp; Elgaard Jensen, T. (2011). ''[http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 Bruno Latour: Hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023006/http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 |date=May 24, 2015 }}''. Suffolk: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; objects to such a comparison.

Although ANT is mostly associated with studies of science and technology and with the sociology of science, it has been making steady progress in other fields of sociology as well.  ANT is adamantly empirical, and as such yields useful insights and tools for sociological inquiry in general. ANT has been deployed in studies of identity and subjectivity, urban transportation systems, and passion and addiction.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gomart, Emilie, and Hennion, Antoin (1999) “[https://www.academia.edu/866668/A_Sociology_of_Attachment_Music_Amateurs_Drug_Addicts A Sociology of Attachment: Music Amateurs, Drug Users]”.

==The actor-network==
As the term implies, the actor-network is the central concept in ANT. The term "network" is somewhat problematic in that as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;&lt;ref name=technology /&gt;&lt;ref name=on&gt;Latour, B. "[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-67%20ACTOR-NETWORK.pdf On Actor Network Theory: A Few Clarifications]"&lt;/ref&gt; notes, it has a number of unwanted connotations. Firstly, it implies that what is described takes the shape of a network, which is not necessarily the case. Secondly, it implies "transportation without deformation," which, in ANT, is not possible since any actor-network involves a vast number of [[#Translation|translations]]. Latour,&lt;ref name=on /&gt; however, still contends that network is a fitting term to use, because "it has no a priori order relation; it is not tied to the axiological myth of a top and of a bottom of society; it makes absolutely no assumption whether a specific locus is macro- or micro- and does not modify the tools to study the element 'a' or the element 'b'." This use of the term "network" is very similar to Deleuze and Guattari's [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomes]]; Latour &lt;ref name=technology /&gt; even remarks tongue in cheek that he would have no objection to renaming ANT "actant-rhizome ontology" if it only had sounded better, which hints at Latour's uneasiness with the word "theory".

Actor–network theory tries to explain how material–semiotic networks come together to act as a whole; the clusters of actors involved in creating meaning are both material and semiotic. As a part of this it may look at explicit strategies for relating different elements together into a network so that they form an apparently coherent whole. These networks are potentially transient, existing in a constant making and re-making.&lt;ref name=RtS&gt;Latour, B., 2005. ''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory]]''. Oxford: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that relations need to be repeatedly “performed” or the network will dissolve. They also assume that networks of relations are not intrinsically coherent, and may indeed contain conflicts. Social relations, in other words, are only ever in process, and must be [[Performativity|performed]] continuously.

Actants denote human and non-human actors, and in a network take the shape that they do by virtue of their relations with one another. It assumes that nothing lies outside the network of relations, and as noted above, suggests that there is no difference in the ability of technology, humans, animals, or other non-humans to act (and that there are only enacted alliances). As soon as an actor engages with an actor-network it too is caught up in the web of relations, and becomes part of the [[entelechy]].

If taken to its logical conclusion, then, nearly any actor can be considered merely a sum of other, smaller actors. A car is an example of a complex system. It contains many electronic and [[machine|mechanical]] components, all of which are essentially hidden from view to the driver, who simply deals with the car as a single object. This effect is known as ''punctualisation'', and is similar to the idea of [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] in [[object-oriented programming]].

When an actor network breaks down, the punctualisation effect tends to cease as well. In the automobile example above, a non-working engine would cause the driver to become aware of the car as a collection of parts rather than just a vehicle capable of transporting them from place to place. This can also occur when elements of a network act contrarily to the network as a whole. In his book ''Pandora’s Hope'', Latour likens depunctualization to the opening of a black box. When closed, the box is perceived simply as a box, although when it is opened all elements inside it becomes visible.

==Human and non-human actors==
ANT is often associated with the equal treatment of human and non-human actors. ANT assumes that all entities in a network can and should be described in the same terms. This is called the principle of ''[[generalized symmetry]]''. The rationale for this is that differences between them are generated in the network of relations, and should not be presupposed.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"/&gt;

===Intermediaries and mediators===
The distinction between intermediaries and mediators is key to ANT sociology. Intermediaries are entities which make no difference (to some interesting state of affairs which we are studying) and so can be ignored. They transport the force of some other entity more or less without transformation and so are fairly uninteresting. Mediators, on the other hand, are entities which multiply difference and so should be the object of study. Their outputs cannot be predicted by their inputs. From an ANT point of view, sociology has tended to treat too much of the world as intermediaries.

For instance, a sociologist might take silk and nylon as intermediaries, holding that the former “means”, “reflects”, or “symbolises” the upper classes and the latter the lower classes. In such a view, the real-world silk–nylon difference is irrelevant — presumably, many other material differences could also, and do also, transport this class distinction. But taken as mediators, these fabrics would have to be engaged with by the analyst in their specificity: the internal real-world complexities of silk and nylon suddenly appear relevant, and are seen as actively constructing the ideological class distinction which they once merely reflected.

For the committed ANT analyst, social things like class distinctions in taste, as in the silk and nylon example, are examples of social construction, but also groups and power must constantly be constructed or performed anew through complex engagements with complex mediators. There is no stand-alone social repertoire lying in the background to be reflected off, expressed through, or substantiated in, interactions (as in an intermediary conception). That being said, it doesn't make sense to say there are social aspects of things. Things themselves are a constitutive part of the social reality they are able to enact.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;

==Other central concepts==

===Translation===
{{main|Translation (sociology)}}
Central to ANT is the concept of translation which is sometimes referred to as '''sociology of translation''', in which innovators attempt to create a ''forum,'' a central network in which all the actors agree that the network is worth building and defending. In his widely debated 1986 study of how marine biologists try to restock the St Brieuc Bay in order to produce more scallops,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Callon (1986). “[http://www.vub.ac.be/SOCO/tesa/RENCOM/Callon%20%281986%29%20Some%20elements%20of%20a%20sociology%20of%20translation.pdf Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of St Brieuc Bay]”. In John Law (ed.), ''Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Callon]] has defined 4 moments of translation: [[problematization]], [[interessement]], enrollment and mobilisation of allies.  Also important to the notion is the role of network objects in helping to smooth out the translation process by creating equivalencies between what would otherwise be very challenging people, organizations or conditions to mesh together.  Bruno Latour spoke about this particular task of objects in his work ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005).

=== Tokens, or quasi-objects ===
In the above examples, “social order” and “functioning car” come into being through the successful interactions of their respective actor-networks, and actor-network theory refers to these creations as ''tokens'' or ''quasi-objects'' which are passed between actors within the network.

As the token is increasingly transmitted or passed through the network, it becomes increasingly punctualized and also increasingly [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]]. When the token is decreasingly transmitted, or when an actor fails to transmit the token (e.g., the oil pump breaks), punctualization and reification are decreased as well.

== Actor network theory and specific disciplines ==
Recently, there has been a movement to introduce Actor Network Theory as an analytical tool to a range of applied disciplines outside of sociology, including nursing, public health, business (Klein and Czarniawska, 2005), library and information science (Beagle, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal|url = |title = The Sociotechnical Networks of Scholarly Communication.|last = Beagle|first = Donald|date = 2001|journal = Portal: Libraries and the Academy |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=421–443|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;); urban studies (Farias and Bender, 2010), and community, urban, and regional planning (Beauregard, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Planning with Things|last = Beauregard|first = Robert|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=32 |pages=182–190|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauregard and Lieto, 2015; Rydin, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Using Actor-Network Theory to understand planning practice: Exploring relationships between actants in regulating low-carbon commercial development|last = Rydin|first = Yvonne|date = 2012|journal = Planning Theory |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–45|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rydin and Tate, 2016, Tate, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Growth management implementation in Metro Vancouver: Lessons  from actor network theory.|last = Tate|first = Laura|date = 2013|journal = Environment and Planning B |volume=40 |issue= |pages=783–800|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== ANT and international relations ===
Actor-Network Theory has become increasingly prominent within the discipline of [[International Relations]] and [[Political Science]].

Theoretically, scholars within IR have employed ANT in order to disrupt traditional world political binaries (civilised/barbarian, democratic/autocratic, etc.),&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"&gt;Austin, Jonathan Luke., 2015. [http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract "We have never been civilized: Torture and the Materiality of World Political Binaries."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204051611/http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract |date=2015-12-04 }} ''European Journal of International Relations'', [[doi:10.1177/1354066115616466]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider the implications of a posthuman understanding of IR,&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, E. and Hobden, S, 2013. “Of parts and wholes: International Relations beyond the human.” ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies', 41(3), pp.430-450.&lt;/ref&gt; explore the infrastructures of world politics,&lt;ref&gt;Barry, A., 2013. “Material Politics.”&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the effects of technological agency.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, A., 2013. “Technological agency in the co-constitution of legal expertise and the US drone program.” ''Leiden Journal of International Law', 26(4), pp.811-831.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirically, IR scholars have drawn on insights from ANT in order to study phenomena including political violences like the use of torture and drones,&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"/&gt; piracy and maritime governance,&lt;ref&gt;Bueger C., 2013. “Practice, pirates, and coast guards.” ''Third World Quarterly', 34(10), pp.1811-1827.&lt;/ref&gt; and garbage.&lt;ref&gt;Acuto, M., 2014. “Everyday International Relations.” ''International Political Sociology', 8(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ANT and design ===
The Actor-Network Theory can also be applied to design, using a perspective that is not simply limited to an analysis of an object's structure. From the ANT viewpoint, design is seen as a series of features that account for a social, psychological, and economical world. ANT argues that objects are designed to shape human action and mold or influence decisions. In this way, the objects' design serves to mediate human relationships and can even impact our morality, ethics, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaneva|first=Albena|title=Making the Social Hold: Towards an Actor-Network Theory of Design|journal=Design and Culture|publication-date=2009|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Actor–network theory insists on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to be actors or participants in networks and systems. Critics including figures such as [[Langdon Winner]] maintain that such properties as ''[[intentionality]]'' fundamentally distinguish humans from animals or from “things” (see [[Activity Theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, L. (1993). [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding It Empty : Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values"] (Vol. 18, pp. 362-378).&lt;/ref&gt; ANT scholars {{Who|date=December 2012}} respond with the following arguments:
* They do not attribute intentionality and similar properties to [[non human|nonhumans]].
* Their conception of [[human agency|agency]] does not presuppose intentionality.
* They locate agency neither in human “subjects” nor in non-human “objects”, but in heterogeneous associations of humans and nonhumans.

ANT has been criticized as amoral. [[Wiebe Bijker]] has responded to this criticism by stating that the amorality of ANT is not a necessity. Moral and political positions are possible, but one must first describe the network before taking up such positions. This position has been further explored by Stuart Shapiro who contrasts ANT with the history of ecology, and argues that research decisions are moral rather than methodological, but this moral dimension has been sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, S. (1997). Caught in a web: The implications of ecology for radical symmetry in STS. Social Epistemology, 11(1), 97-110. [[doi:10.1080/02691729708578832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittle and Spicer note that "ANT has also sought to move beyond deterministic models that trace organizational phenomena back to powerful individuals, social structures, hegemonic discourses or technological effects. Rather, ANT prefers to seek out complex patterns of causality rooted in connections between actors." They argue that ANT's ontological realism makes it "less well equipped for pursuing a critical account of organizations—that is, one which recognises the unfolding nature of reality, considers the limits of knowledge and seeks to challenge structures of domination." &lt;ref&gt;Andrea Whittle and [[André Spicer]], 2008. Is actor network theory critique? ''Organization Studies'' 2008 29: 611&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that ANT does not account for pre-existing structures, such as power, but rather sees these structures as emerging from the actions of actors within the network and their ability to align in pursuit of their interests. Accordingly, ANT can be seen as an attempt to re-introduce [[Whig history]] into [[science and technology studies]]; like the myth of the [[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|heroic inventor]], ANT can be seen as an attempt to explain successful innovators by saying only that they were successful. Likewise, for organization studies, Whittle and Spicer assert that ANT is, "ill suited to the task of developing political alternatives to the imaginaries of market managerialism."

Key early criticism came from other members of the STS community, in particular the "Epistemological Chicken" debate between Collins and Yearley with responses from Latour and Callon as well as Woolgar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Collins and Yearley accused ANTs approach of collapsing into an endless relativist regress.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M., &amp; Yearley, S. (1992). Epistemological Chicken. In A. Pickering (Ed.), Science as Practice and Culture (pp. 301-326). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Some critics&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdamska, O. (1990). 'Surely You're Joking, Mr Latour!'. Science, Technology, Human Values. Vol.15(4) pp.495-504.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that research based on ANT perspectives remains entirely descriptive and fails to provide explanations for social processes. ANT—like comparable social scientific methods—requires judgement calls from the researcher as to which actors are important within a network and which are not. Critics{{Who|date=July 2013}} argue that the importance of particular actors cannot be determined in the absence of “out-of-network” criteria. Similarly, others{{Who|date=October 2014}} argue that actor-networks risk degenerating into endless chains of association ([[six degrees of separation]]—we are all networked to one another). Other research perspectives such as [[social constructionism]], [[social shaping of technology]], [[social network theory]], [[normalization process theory]], [[Diffusion of Innovations]] theory are held to be important alternatives to ANT approaches.

In a workshop called “On Recalling ANT”, [[Bruno Latour]] stated that there are four things wrong with actor-network theory: “actor”, “network”, “theory” and the hyphen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf Keynote Speech: On Recalling ANT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210351/http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf |date=July 14, 2014 }}, Lancester University, Department of Sociology&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book however (''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network–Theory]]''), Latour reversed himself, accepting the wide use of the term, “''including'' the hyphen” (Latour 2005:9).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2014}} He also remarked how he had been helpfully reminded that the ANT acronym “was perfectly fit for a blind, myopic, workaholic, trail-sniffing, and collective traveler” (the ant, Latour 2005:9) — qualitative hallmarks of actor-network [[epistemology]].

A '''canon''' in the sphere of [[visual arts]] and [[aesthetics]], or an '''aesthetic canon''', is a rule for [[Body proportions|proportions]], so as to produce a harmoniously formed figure.

==Evolution==
{{Main|Female body shape}}
By extension, the norms of a certain epoch as to what is or is not considered beautiful may be called a '''canon of beauty'''. These norms have varied over time and what is considered beautiful in one era may not necessarily be so in another. Canons of beauty follow the evolution of [[fashion]] and are dependent on the evolution of physical decoration techniques such as [[hairdressing]] or [[make up]].

Under France's [[Ancien Régime]], canons of beauty required a woman to have as white a skin as possible. This was achieved (sometimes to the danger of health) by [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] and [[face powder]]s as well as 'mouches', fake moles made of black muslin glued onto the face or chest. Today, by contrast, such canons prefer a 'healthier' skin colour, sportiness, gait and so on.

According to the anthropologist Alfred-Louis Kroeber, the female silhouette regularly revolves through one of three basic shapes&amp;mdash;[[bustle]], [[scabbard]], [[bell (instrument)|bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Nathalie Bailleux and Bruno Remaury, ''Modes et vêtements'', collection “[[Découvertes Gallimard]]” (nº 239), series Culture et société, Éditions Gallimard ({{ISBN|2-07-053270-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proportions in art==
{{See also|Body proportions}}
For his painting ''The Birth of Venus'' [[Sandro Botticelli]] stated that the distance between the nipple and navel, between the two legs and between the navel and the groin must all be equal for a figure to (in his opinion) be ideally proportioned. Other such systems of 'ideal proportions' in painting and sculpture include the [[Polyclitean canon]] and [[Vitruvian module]]s, best known in the [[Vitruvian Man]].

== Overview  ==
India’s [[rhetoric]] could be said to be a link between the [[West]] and [[East]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Rhetoric: An Historical and Cross-Cultural Introduction|last=Kennedy|first=George A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=0195109333|location=New York|pages=171–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Greek [[sophist]]s, some Indian rhetors in the seventh century BCE held public debates on religion to the public’s amusement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Vedic verses]], composed over three thousand years ago, use similes, similar to [[ancient Greek poetry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Indian rhetoric utilizes systems of categorization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These categorizations appear in early Buddhist writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, India’s Hindu [[caste system]] led to differences in how member of different castes addressed each other, with people from lower castes referring to themselves in a derogatory manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, the [[Upanishads]], a collection of ancient Brahmin dialogues, place value in categorizing technical terms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[History of Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhist]] rhetoric places value in calm and humorous discourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nyanya Rhetoric ===
Lloyd (2007) has proposed [[Nyaya]]’s inclusion in the field of rhetorical studies, exploring its methods within their historical context, comparing its approach to the “traditional logical syllogism, and relating it to the contemporary perspectives [[Stephen Toulmin]], [[Kenneth Burke]], and [[Chaïm Perelman|Chaim Perelman]].”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Keith|date=2007|title=Rethinking Rhetoric from an Indian Perspective: Implications in the ‘Nyaya Sutra.’|url=|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=26|issue=4|page=365|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyaya is a [[Sanskrit]] word which means just or right and refers to “the science of right and wrong reasoning” (Radhakrishnan &amp; Moore, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;356).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=A Source Book in Indian Philosophy|last=Radhakrishnan|first=Sarvepalli|last2=Moore|first2=Charles Alexander|date=|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1957|isbn=|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sutra]] is also a Sanskrit word which means string or thread. Here Sutra refers to a collection of [[aphorism]] in the form of a manual. Each Sutra is a short rule usually consisted of one or two sentences. Example of a Sutra: “Reality is truth, and what is true is so, irrespective of whether we know it is, or are aware of that truth.” The [[Nyāya Sūtras|Nyaya Sutra]] is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by Aksapada Gautama.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nyaya Sutras of Gotama|last=Vidyabhusana|first=M.M. Satisa Chandra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1930|isbn=8120807480|location=Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the foundational text of the Nyaya School of Hindu Philosophy. The date when the text was composed, and the biography of its author is unknown. It is estimated that the text was composed between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zimmer (2013) has said that the text may have been composed by more one author, over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophies of India|last=Zimmer|first=Heinrich|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415462327|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radhakrishan and Moore (1957) placed its origin in the “third century BC…..though some of the contents of the Nyaya Sutra are certainly a post-Christian era” (p.&amp;nbsp;36).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Vidyabhushana|Vidyabhusana]] (1930) stated that the ancient school of Nyaya extended over a period of one thousand years, beginning with Gotama about 550 BC and ending with Vatsyayana about 400 AD.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''Nyaya'' provides significant insight into the Indian rhetoric.  Naya presents an argumentative approach that works a [[rhetor]] how to decide about any argument. In addition, it proposes a new approach of thinking of a cultural tradition which is different from the Western rhetoric. It also broadens the view of rhetoric and the relationship among human beings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  ''Nyaya'' proposes an enlightenment of reality which is associated with situations, time, and places. Toulmin emphasizes on the situational dimension of argumentative genre as the fundamental component of any rhetorical logic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the contrary, ''Nyaya'' views this situational rhetoric in a new way which offers context of practical arguments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">'''Art historical photo archives''' (or photoarchives) are collections of reproductions of works of art that document paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, architecture and sometimes installation photos. They are essential resource tools for the study of art history.  Image collections deepen understanding of specific objects of art and the careers of individual artists as they also provide the means for a comparative approach to the study of artists’ works, national schools and period styles.  The documentation that accompanies the images can also reveal patterns of art collecting, art market fluctuations and the changeable nature of public opinion.  Photo archives build their collections and gather documentation for the works of art they record through purchases, gifts and photography campaigns.  Information about ownership, condition, attribution, and subject identification is recorded at the time of acquisition and is frequently updated.

==History==

The  founders of important art historical photo archives believed that a deep and broad visual knowledge was necessary for the study of art history.   These pioneers,  including [[Richard Hamann]], [[Aby Warburg]], [[Sir Robert Witt]], [[William Martin Conway]], [[Bernard Berenson]], [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] and [[Helen Clay Frick]], were the first to realize the potential of photography as a means to provide researchers with materials that strengthen the documentation and interpretation of works of art.   The photo archives they founded in the first half of the 20th century, now part of [[FotoMarburg]], the [[Warburg Institute]], the [[Witt Library]],  [[Villa I Tatti]], the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]], and the [[Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive]],  are still used by countless researchers in the first half of the 21st century.

==Uses==

*Art historical photo archives collect images of works without regard to trends or the popular reception of any given artist’s work. They thus retain files for artists not held in high esteem but whose reputations among scholars may change in years to come.
*Many of the works of art recorded in photo archives are unpublished or relatively inaccessible since they reside in private collections or public institution storerooms.
*Art historical photo archives provide a forum for scholarly dialogue across the decades, affording art historians the opportunity to record opinions regarding attribution or current ownership of works they know well.
*As art history and art connoisseurship have matured, photo archives have played a key role, the fruits of which are most obvious in publications such as Bernard Berenson’s lists of works by Italian artists and Richard Offner’s Corpus of Florentine Painting (today continued by Miklos Boskovits).  The refinement of attributions of works of art recorded in a photo archive can lead to the reevaluation of an artist’s career or the identification of a new, previously unnamed master.  In this way, a photo archive functions in much the same way as the curatorial records of museum drawings departments, where annotations by scholars of several generations record the various attributions ascribed to the work over time.
*Photo archives aid researchers in their connoisseurship skills since they include copies, forgeries and pastiches.
*Multiple images of a single work of art help scholars trace the physical changes that have affected the object through time, damage, and conservation.  Photo archives often document the full visual record of a given work of art, information that is unlikely to be published because of financial limitations.
*Photo archives enable discovery and innovative scholarship as researchers browse within and across artist files.
*Photo archives are essential to the study of works of art that have been destroyed or lost as a result of war, fire or theft.

==Future==

In 2009 the Courtauld Institute in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz organized a series of conferences that were held in  London, Florence and New York to discuss the future of photo archives.  They felt that an examination of the origins of photo archives can help guide and shape their future and, at the same time, convey to the uninitiated how image resources continue to be used as essential elements for art historical research. Few doubt that if Helen Frick, Robert Witt, or W.M. Conway had lived to see the potential of digitizing the photo archives they established in the 1920s, they would have dedicated enormous resources and careful thought to realizing the digital future.  However, there is a problem for photo archives in that currently they have no copyright claim to the majority of the images in their collection and thus they are unable to display them on the web.  It is therefore now their task to develop and promote a new model for access and use of these extraordinary resources that will maximize the opportunities of current and future technical advances in a way that suits the demands of today’s scholars.  This selection process, which is implicit in digitization projects and will inevitably exclude some images, renders the analog archive as indispensable as ever in the digital era.  Whatever the method of delivery, whether the photograph itself or its digital surrogate, photo archives remain essential to the study of art history.  The conferences produced the [[Florence Declaration]], which made several recommendations for the preservation of analogue photo archives.  As of May 2011, nearly 500 scholars had signed the Declaration.

'''Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center''' (AJWRC) is a [[non-governmental organisation]] founded in 1994 that advocates [[gender equality]], the end of violence against women, a more just society, and environmentally [[sustainable development]].

AJWRC holds events like empowerment seminars and study groups for women, training and workshops, and they also publish research and conduct outreach campaigns in furtherance of their mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/141 HumanTrafficking.org organization overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002845/http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/141 |date=March 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The activities serve to raise awareness among Japanese women of global as well as domestic issues. Because [[Japan]] is a leading nation in the Asian economy and international politics, the organisation feels an obligation to encourage Japanese women to take a leading role in advocacy for improved [[human rights]]. Additionally, Japan is the destination for the largest number of cross-border [[human trafficking]] victims in [[Asia]], which AJWRC takes as further impetus for their mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aworc.org/org/ajwrc/ajwrc.html AWORC member profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Disparity between genders has been shrinking in most developed countries over the last century, but AJWRC holds that Japan has lagged behind the trend. As examples, women represent a mere 10% of the [[National Diet]], [[Japan]]'s legislative body, and women earn just 60% of the salary of their male counterparts in the workforce.

AJWRC grew out of the Asian Women's Association, which was founded in 1977, when gender inequality was even more severe. It wasn't until 1985 that the Japanese government ratified a [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]],&lt;ref&gt;Yuji Iwasawa. ''International Law, Human Rights, and Japanese Law.'' Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and the country received failing marks as late as 1986 in [[Humana]]'s ''World Human Rights Guide''&lt;ref name=Iwasawa234&gt;Yuji Iwasawa. ''International Law, Human Rights, and Japanese Law.'' Page 234.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the status of women, and is one of the industrialized world's least equal countries in terms of gender gap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf WEF Gender Gap Report]. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AWA initially focused on protesting the [[sex trade]], but as their influence grew, they expanded their mandate to tackle women's issues more broadly in the country, eventually forming AJWRC as it is today. According to the group's website, they work "to end all forms of violence and discrimination against women, toward democratic Japanese society based on respect for [[human rights]] and gender equality, and toward a fair and sustainable global society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajwrc.org/eng/modules/pico1/index.php?content_id=1 AJWRC Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;Jessica Ocheltree, [http://metropolis.co.jp/features/global-village/asia-japan-womens-resource-center/ Asia-Japan Women’s Resource Center], Metropolis, 9 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burra Katha''', also spelled Burrakatha, is an [[oral storytelling]] technique in the [[Katha (storytelling format)|Katha]] tradition, performed in villages of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]. The troupe consists of one main performer and two co-performers. It is a narrative entertainment that consists of prayers, solo drama, dance, songs, poems and jokes. The topic will be either a [[Hindu]] mythological story ([[Jangam|Jangam Katha]]) or a contemporary social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Burrakatha loses sheen sans patronage| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-14/visakhapatnam/36332535_1_artistes-burrakatha-art-form |date=Jan 14, 2013| accessdate = 2013-09-02
| publisher = [[The Times of India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Burra - Katha was developed in Guntur district around 1942 with the aim of propagating political ideas among illiterate masses in villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4U5AAAAIAAJ|title=Vidya Bharathi|last=Lectures|first=Bangalore University Dept of Publications and Extension|date=1977-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communists with the help of Andhra Praja Natya Mandali founded by Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Bezawada spread the message to the masses in the Naizam region during the rebellion against Nizam in the 1940s.

==Etymology==
"Burra" is referred to [[Tanpura|tambura]], a musical string instrument with a hollow shell. "Katha" means story.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Burrakatha.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Burrakatha photo from Vepachedu research foundation]] --&gt;
Burra means a skull in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. The shell resembles a [[human skull]]. It is made of baked clay or dried pumpkin, or of brass and copper. The instrument looks very similar to [[veena]] and the performer can pull and press strings to get music.

==Alternative names==
Burrakatha refers to the art throughout [[Andhra Pradesh]], and there are local names in each region.
* Coastal region: Tamboora or Jangam or Tandanana Katha
* Rayalaseema: Tamboora or Tandana katha or suddulu
* Telangana: Tamboora or Sarada katha

==History==
Burrakatha started as devotional songs of nomadic people and became a popular art form. It is played on radio and TV regularly in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is a 20th-century name for the theater show known as [[Jangam]] Katha. The [[jangam|jangams lingayats]] were wandering minstrels who worshiped and sang of [[Shiva|Lord Siva]]. Two performers participated in these plays: the storyteller and his wife. With societal and cultural changes, the secular aspect was incorporated into this form. The modern form has three performers of any gender.

Popular Hindu artists were Pendyala Venkateswarrao, Sunkara Sri Krishna Madhava Rao, Paruchuri Ramakotayya, Sirivisetti Subbarao, Kosuri Punnayya, Govardhana, Kakumanu Subbarao, Davuluru, Chintalal Suryanarayana, Budagajangala mote papaiah, Budagajangala mote kullayappa, Budagajangala mote ramalingam, etc. Women also formed groups, e.g., Moturi Udayam, Chintala Koteswaramma, Mahankali Lakshmi, Sridevi sisters, etc. Popular non-Hindu artists are Abraham Bhagavatar, Manohara Kavi, Khader Khan Sahib, Shaik Nazar etc.

==Modern form==
The main storyteller (kathakudu) narrates the story. He plays tambura and dances to music. He also wears a metal ring called an andelu on his right thumb, holds another ring in his other hand and adds more music by colliding them frequently.  The co-performers plays gummeta (also called dakki or budike), earthen drums with two heads. All three or only the kathakadu wear anklets (also called as gajjelu), which add even more music when they dance.

The right side performer (hasyaka, meaning joker) acts as a joker and cracks satires and jokes. The left side performer (rajakiya, meaning politician) acts as someone who knows worldly ways and talks about politics and social issues. The main performer and co-performers constantly was address each other. The co-performers interrupt the kathakudu with doubts, and they sometimes add emphasis to the main events in the story with short words similar to "Wow!" "Aha!" and "That is it."

Whenever the main performer sings a song, he or she starts with "vinara veera kumara veera gadha vinara" followed by the co-performers singing "tandhana tane tandhana na." It is also called 'tandana katha.'

==Significance==
Burra katha was a pastime event in villages. It is seen even now during [[Navratri|Dussehra]] or [[Sankranti]] festival seasons to describe events in epics like [[Ramayan]] and [[Mahabharat]] and also some of best and moral stories of kings like kambojaraju katha, chinnamma katha, muggurumoratila katha, etc.

It played an effective role in conveying message to people and awakening them during [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Burrakatha was banned in [[Madras]] by the British government and in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] kingdom by Nizam government, because it was the medium to enlighten the people of the political situation in political meetings.

==Present==
Burrakatha tellers are called as budagajangalu. Internet and movies play a major role in modern life.
That's why the burrakathas are not being seen and no one is there to develop this and improve the art.
In past these burrakatha tellers were important in the villages; now there is no response for their art.

So these burrakatha tellers left their traditional art and have become beggars or day labourers. Even in these modern times, there are no educated people in this tribe. They don't have caste certificates for developing their tribe.

[[Daroji Eramma]] was a performer of Burra katha from [[Karnataka]].

{{Expert-subject|literature|date=February 2012}}
'''Chiastic structure''', or '''chiastic pattern''', is a [[literary technique]] in [[motif (narrative)|narrative motif]]s and other textual passages.  An example of chiastic structure would be two ideas, A and B, together with variants A' and B', being presented as A,B,B',A'.  Alternative names{{cn|date=August 2015}} include '''ring structure''', because the opening and closing 'A' can be viewed as completing a circle, '''palistrophe''',&lt;ref&gt;The term "palistrophe" was coined in:  {{citation |first= Sean E. |last= McEvenue |title= The Narrative Style of the Priestly Writer |publisher= Biblical Institute Press |place= Rome |year= 1971 |oclc= 292126 }}.{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or symmetric structure. It may be regarded as [[chiasmus]] scaled up from clauses to larger units of text.

These often [[symmetric]]al patterns are commonly found in ancient literature such as the [[epic poetry]] of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Classicist Bruno Gentili describes this technique as "the cyclical, circular, or 'ring' pattern (''ring composition''). Here the idea that introduced a compositional section is repeated at its conclusion, so that the whole passage is framed by material of identical content"&lt;ref&gt;Gentili, Bruno, ''Poetry and Its Public in Ancient Greece: From Homer to the Fifth Century'', trans. A. Thomas Cole (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), 48&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile in classical prose, scholars often find chiastic narrative techniques in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Herodotus frequently uses ring composition or ‘epic regression’ as a way of supplying background information for something discussed in the narrative. First an event is mentioned briefly, then its precedents are reviewed in reverse chronological order as far back as necessary; at that point the narrative reverses itself and moves forward in chronological order until the event in the main narrative line is reached again."&lt;ref&gt;Boedeker, Deborah. "Epic Heritage and Mythical Patterns in Herodotus." Published in ''Companion to Herodotus'', ed. Egbert J. Bakker, Irene J. F. de Jong, and Hans van Wees (Brill, 2002), 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Various chiastic structures are also seen in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[New Testament]], and the [[Quran]]. 

Chiastic structures also appear in [[Ancient Greek sculpture]]. The [[contrapposto]] technique of sculpture in Ancient Greek sculpture often lead to this chiastic structure, such as in the [[Diadumenos]] of [[Polykleitos]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Chiastic.svg|thumb|120px|When read left to right, up to down, the first topic (A) is reiterated as the last, and the middle concept (B) appears twice in succession. (Also, the middle concept could appear just once.)]]
The term ''chiastic'' derives from the mid-17th century term [[chiasmus]], which refers to a ''crosswise arrangement'' of concepts or words that are repeated in reverse order. ''Chiasmus'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''khiasmos'', a word that is ''khiazein'', marked with the letter ''[[Chi (letter)|khi]]''. From ''khi'' comes ''chi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Chiasmus |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiasmus |work=Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chi'' is made up of two lines crossing each other as in the shape of an ''X''. The line that starts leftmost on top, comes down, and  is rightmost on the bottom, and vice versa. If one thinks of the lines as concepts, one sees that concept A, which comes first, is also last, and concept B, which comes after A, comes before A. If one adds in more lines representing other concepts, one gets a chiastic structure with more concepts.
See Proverbs 1:20-33; vs 20-21=A, v 22=B, v 23=C, vs 24-25=D, vs 26-28=E, vs 29-30=D', v 31=C', v 32=B', v 33=A'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garrett|1993|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemonic device==
[[Oral literature]] is especially rich in chiastic structure, possibly as an aid to memorization. In his study of the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]], Cedric Whitman, for instance, finds a chiastic structure "of the most amazing virtuosity" that simultaneously performed both aesthetic and mnemonic functions, permitting the oral poet to easily recall the basic formulae of the composition during performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Cedric M. |last= Whitman |title= Homer and the Heroic Tradition |place= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |year= 1958 |oclc= 310021 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Hebrew Bible==

{{main|Book of Daniel#Chiasm in the Aramaic section}}

In 1986, [[William H. Shea]] proposed that the [[Book of Daniel]] is composed of a ''double-chiasm''. He argued that the chiastic structure is emphasized by the two languages that the book is written in: [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew]]. The first chiasm is written in ''Aramaic'' from chapters 2-7 following an ABC...CBA pattern. The second chiasm is in ''Hebrew'' from chapters 8-12, also using the ABC...CBA pattern. However, Shea represents Daniel 9:26 as "D", a break in the center of the pattern.&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{harvnb|Shea|1986|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Wenham]] has analyzed the [[Genesis flood narrative|Genesis Flood narrative]] and has shown that it is essentially an elaborate chiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon J. Wenham, "The Coherence of the Flood Narrative" ''Vetus Testamentum'' 28 (1978) 336–348.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the earlier study of grammatical structure by F. I.  Andersen,&lt;ref&gt;F. I. Andersen, ''The Sentence in Biblical Hebrew'' (The Hague, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Wenham illustrated a chiastic structure as displayed in the following two tables.

{| class="wikitable" 
|-
|+ Chiastic structure of the Genesis Flood Narrative
|-
|A: Noah and his sons (Gen 6:10)
:B: All life on earth (6:13:a)
::C: Curse on earth (6:13:b)
:::D: Flood announced (6:7)
::::E: Ark (6:14-16)
:::::F: All living creatures (6:17–20 )
::::::G: Food (6:21)
:::::::H: Animals in man’s hands (7:2–3)
::::::::I: Entering the Ark (7:13–16)
:::::::::J: Waters increase (7:17–20)
::::::::::X: God remembers Noah (8:1)
:::::::::J: Waters decrease (8:13–14)
::::::::I': Exiting the Ark (8:15–19) 
:::::::H': Animals (9:2,3)
::::::G': Food (9:3,4)
:::::F': All living creatures (9:10a)
::::E':  Ark (9:10b)
:::D’:No flood in future (9:11)
::C': Blessing on earth (9:12–17)
:B': All life on earth (9:16)
A: Noah and his sons (9:18,19a)
|}

Within this overall structure, there is a numerical mini-chiasm of 7s, 40s, and 150s:
{| class="wikitable" 
|-
|+ Chiasm of the numbers 7, 40, and 150
|-
|α: Seven days waiting to enter Ark (7:4)
:β: Second mention of seven days waiting (7:10)
::γ: 40 days (7:17)
:::δ: 150 days (7:24)
::::χ: God remembers Noah (8:1)
:::δ': 150 days (8:3)
::γ': 40 days (8:6)
:β': Seven days waiting for dove (8:10)
α': Second seven days waiting for dove (8:12)
|}

The two mentions of the 150 days refer to the same period, and the first 40 days (7:13,17) are part of the 150 days. All this is consistent with the date in 8:4. There was no compelling reason to repeat the first 7-day figure of waiting to enter the Ark except for the corresponding two 7-day figures for the dove. The second mention of the 150 days was also because of the chiasmus. The chiastic structure explains the repetition of these figures. Before these ancient literary conventions were recognized, followers of the [[Documentary Hypothesis]] explained the repetition by hypothesizing two different authors or redactors (J or Jahwist and P or Priestly sources). The repetition may also show the literary artistry of a single author or editor, either working from one tradition or weaving together the J and P sources in chiastic fashion.

==Use in the Quran==

While there are many examples of chiastic structure in the Quran, perhaps the most well known is in the 'Verse of the Throne' or 'Ayat al-Kursi'. The verse contains 9 sentences which exhibit chiasmus, but perhaps more interesting is that it is found in the longest chapter of the Quran, [[Al-Baqara]], which itself contains a fractal chiastic structure in its 286 verses, i.e. where each (outer) chiasm is composed of (inner) chiastic structures reflected in some sense in the analogue outer chiasm. One such analysis of the chapter is shown below (from &lt;ref&gt;Abu Zakariya, "Ring Theory: the Quran’s Structural Coherence", September 21 2015, https://www.islam21c.com/islamic-thought/ring-theory-the-qurans-structural-coherence/ &lt;/ref&gt;; alternate and/or more detail analyses can be found in &lt;ref&gt;Raymond K. Farrin, "Surat al‐Baqara: A Structural Analysis", January 19 2010, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1478-1913.2009.01299.x&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Hassan uz Zaman Shamol, http://understandquran.com/coherence-evidence-of-the-qurans-literary-depth.html&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt; Muhammad Rizvi , " Symmetry in Sura al-Baqara", June 01 2018, https://tgminitiative.blogspot.com/2018/06/symmetry-in-sura-al-baqara.html &lt;/ref&gt;).

Muhammad Rizvi, an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, has identified chapter-wide chiastic structures in Sura al-Yasin, Sura al-Zukhruf, Sura al-Faatir, Sura al-Qalam, Sura al-Muzammil, and other chapters of the Quran &lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Rizvi, "What is TGM?"

==ABC…CBA pattern==

===''Beowulf''===
In literary texts with a possible [[Oral literature|oral]] origin, such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', chiastic or ring structures are often found on an intermediate level, that is, between the (verbal and/or grammatical) level of [[chiasmus]] and the higher level of chiastic structure such as noted in the Torah. John D. Niles provides examples of chiastic figures on all three levels.&lt;ref name="Niles"&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=924–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that for the instances of ll. 12–19, the announcement of the birth of (Danish) Beowulf, are chiastic, more or less on the verbal level, that of chiasmus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=924–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, each of the three main fights are organized chiastically, a chiastic structure on the level of verse paragraphs and shorter passages. For instance, the simplest of these three, the fight with [[Grendel]], is schematized as follows:

A: Preliminaries
*Grendel approaching
*Grendel rejoicing
*Grendel devouring Handscioh
:B: Grendel's wish to flee ("fingers cracked")
::C: Uproar in hall; Danes stricken with terror
:::HEOROT IN DANGER OF FALLING
::C': Uproar in hall; Danes stricken with terror
:B': "Joints burst"; Grendel forced to flee
A': Aftermath
*Grendel slinking back toward fens
*Beowulf rejoicing
*Beowulf left with Grendel's arm&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=925–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Niles provides a diagram of the highest level of chiastic structure, the organization of the poem as a whole, in an introduction, three major fights with interludes before and after the second fight (with Grendel's mother), and an epilogue. To illustrate, he analyzes Prologue and Epilogue as follows:

'''Prologue'''&lt;br&gt;
A: Panegyric for [[Scyld]]&lt;br&gt;
:B: Scyld's funeral
::C: History of Danes before [[Hroðgar|Hrothgar]]
:::D: Hrothgar's order to build [[Heorot]]

'''Epilogue'''&lt;br&gt;
:::D': Beowulf's order to build his barrow

{{Performing arts}}

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

'''''De Prospectiva pingendi''''' (On the Perspective of painting) is the earliest and only pre–1500 Renaissance treatise solely devoted to the subject of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andersen|first=Kirsti|title=The Geometry of Art|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-25961-1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by the Italian master [[Piero della Francesca]] late in his career but possibly by c. 1474.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Martin|title=The Science of Art|date=1990|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=0-300-05241-3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|authorlink=Mario Livio|title=The Golden Ratio|publisher=[[Random House|Broadway Books]]|location=New York|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C&amp;pg=PA126|isbn=0-7679-0816-3|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its Latin title, the opus is written in Italian.

==The book==
The subjects covered by Piero della Francesca in these writings include [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and innovative work in both [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;[http://www.codicesillustres.com/catalogue/de_prospectiva_pingendi/], Codices Illustres&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The script consists of three parts:

* Part One ''Disegno'', describing techniques for painting faces
* Part Two ''Commensurazio'', describing perspectives
* Part Three ''Coloro'', describing techniques for creating perspectives by using colours

==History==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

''De Prospectiva Pingendi'' was probably created in the years between 1474 until 1482.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit13/unit13.html#Francesca], Dartmouth College&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428630/On-Perspective-in-Painting], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The writings were inspired by the book ''[[De pictura]]'' by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]&lt;ref name=A/&gt; written in 1435&lt;ref name=B/&gt; but probably also by works by [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329120658/http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}, Computer Animation Lab&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript later came into the possession of the [[Biblioteca Palatina]] in [[Parma]]&lt;ref name=E/&gt; before it was transferred to the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

Much of Piero’s work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably [[Luca Pacioli]]. Piero’s work on solid geometry appears in Pacioli’s ''[[De divina proportione]]'', a work illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

In 1899 the writings were first published in bookform.&lt;ref name=C&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnh3FKIKT9AC&amp;pg=PA606&amp;lpg=PA606&amp;dq=De+prospectiva+pingendi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=44K40GH0dO&amp;sig=TW1qcfzitd7mGdpO-mIdCIl3FAw&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=l4DBS43YHOGkOKGZ5JYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20prospectiva%20pingendi&amp;f=false], Google Books.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is one thing that is absolutely certain about throwing a dead cat on the dining room table – and I don’t mean that people will be outraged, alarmed, disgusted. That is true, but irrelevant.

In art, a '''dedication''' is the creation or attribution of a work of art as a [[tribute]] to or in honor of a person, place, or thing. The dedicatee may be the [[commission (art)|commissioner]], conductor, premiere performer or musical ensemble, or patron. The work may be [[memorial]].

In music, examples include many of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s works, such as the [[Piano Sonata No. 30 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata Op. 109]], dedicated to his friend [[Antonie Brentano]]'s daughter Maximiliane.&lt;ref name="Anderson2007"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.557724&amp;catNum=557724&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|last=Anderson|first=Keith|title=Beethoven: Piano Trios, Vol. 2 – Piano Trios Nos. 1, 2, 9|publisher=[[Naxos Records]]|type=CD|ID=8.572343|year=2007|ref={{harvid|Anderson|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CooperP225"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Tq5ci-9OMLEC|title=Beethoven|last=Cooper|first=Barry|authorlink=Barry Cooper (musicologist)|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|year=2000|isbn=978-0191592706|page=225|ref={{harvid|Cooper|2000}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital artifact''' in information science, is any undesired or unintended alteration in data introduced in a digital process by an involved technique and/or technology. In anthropology and archeology a digital artifact is an artifact that is of a digital nature or creation. For example, a gif is such an artifact.  

Digital artifact can be of any content types including text, audio, video, image, animation or a combination. 

== Information science ==
In information science, digital artifacts result from:
*Hardware malfunction: In computer graphics, [[visual artifact]]s may be generated whenever a hardware component such as the processor, memory chip, cabling malfunctions, etc., corrupts data. Examples of malfunctions include physical damage, overheating, insufficient voltage and [[GPU]] [[overclocking]]. Common types of hardware artifacts are [[Texture mapping|texture]] corruption and [[T-vertices]] in 3D graphics, and [[pixelization]] in MPEG compressed video.
*Software malfunction: Artifacts may be caused by algorithm flaws such as decoding/encoding audio or video, or a poor pseudo-random number generator that would introduce artifacts distinguishable from the desired noise into statistical models.
*[[Compression artifact|Compression]]: Controlled amounts of unwanted information may be generated as a result of the use of [[lossy compression]] techniques. One example is the artifacts seen in [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]] compression algorithms that produce [[compression artifact|compression artifacts]].
*[[Aliasing]]: Digital imprecision generated in the process of converting analog information into digital space is due to the limited granularity of digital numbering space. In computer graphics, aliasing is seen as [[pixelation]].
*[[Rolling shutter]], the line scanning of an object that is moving too fast for the image sensor to capture a unitary image.
*[[Error diffusion]]: poorly-weighted kernel coefficients result in undesirable visual artifacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5873">'''Digital classics''' is the application of the tools of [[digital humanities]] to the field of [[classics]], or more broadly to the study of the [[ancient world]].

==History==

Classics was one of the first of the humanities disciplines to adopt computing approaches; the first references to the use of computing in the classical humanities date to the early 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Arguably, the first references to the use of computing to study a text in a classical language are to a project at IBM to create a computer generated concordance of Aquinas beginning in 1949; for this, see Theodore F. Brunner, "Classics and the Computer: The History of a Relationship," in ''Accessing Antiquity: The Computerization of Classical Studies'' (1993), ed. Jon Solomon, Tucson: U. Arizona Press, for a general introduction to the early history of computing in the classical humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; which might be surprising considering the reputation of the discipline as old-fashioned and stuffily traditionalist.&lt;ref&gt;See also: Busa, Roberto. (1980). ‘The Annals of Humanities Computing: The Index Thomisticus’, in ''Computers and the Humanities'' 14:83-90. The ''[http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/ Index Thomisticus]'' is arguably the first humanities computing project and this seminal article deals specifically with the digitisation of this Latin text as well as reflecting on the nature and purpose of this field of scholarship.&lt;/ref&gt; Major projects such as the [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]], founded in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. http://www.tlg.uci.edu/about/history.php for the history of this project&lt;/ref&gt; and the text collections of the [[Packard Humanities Institute]] set the trend, and there are still a significantly large number of ancient world projects among Humanities Computing projects today.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the projects listed at http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cch/research/projects.html or http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/iathrails/projects/homepage&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the success of traditional scholarly publications in digital guises, such as seen in the ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'',&lt;ref&gt;See http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/about.html for information on the history and scope of this publication&lt;/ref&gt; and the early adoption of hypertext in high profile projects like the Perseus Digital Library&lt;ref&gt;The Perseus Project was originally published on the HyperCard platform in 1990 — around the time of the invention of the World Wide Web; see archival versions of the Perseus 1.0 documentation, http://vanth.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/P1/Doc1.info.html and the Platform-Independent Perseus documentation, http://vanth.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/PIP2/Goals_Help.html, Mylonas, "The Perseus Project," http://xml.coverpages.org/mylonasPerseus.html, and Mylonas, Crane, Morrell, and Smith, "The Perseus Project: Data in the Electronic Age" in Solomon, ''Accessing Antiquity'' ''op. cit.'' for information toward a history of Perseus' use of hypertext platforms and other information infrastructures.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to legitimize computing in the study of classics in ways that has not always been the case in other areas of the humanities.

This apparent paradox may be as a result of the many methodologies and different sources of evidence that classicists have always had to embrace, from literary sources and linguistics, to art history and archaeology, history, philosophy, religious theory, ancient documents such as [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyrology|papyri]], and so forth. The fragmentary nature of many of the texts and languages of the ancient world, the scattered evidence from the material culture of ancient Greece and Rome, and the necessity to evaluate all these varieties of evidence in context are particularly likely to benefit from digital approaches such as databases, text markup, and image manipulation.

==Digital classics projects==
There are currently several major projects that aim to encourage and develop digital approaches to classical scholarship. The Stoa Consortium at the [[University of Kentucky]] distributes news of the discipline, and serves as a peer-reviewed electronic publication venue, and encourages [[open source]] approaches to digital classics. The [[Perseus Project]] is a digital library that also provides a collection of digital texts and analysis tools to the public; principally (but not exclusively) classical.  [[Digital Classicist]] at [[King's College London]] is another project and community which shares information and advice about the [[digital humanities]] applied to the field of classics.&lt;ref&gt;See http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool Classics Mailing List is a project which can be subscribed to in which one receives email regarding Classics events around the world, as well as call for papers, studentships and public lectures.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.lsoft.com/scripts/wl.exe?SL1=CLASSICISTS&amp;H=LISTSERV.LIV.AC.UK for details&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6760">In [[linguistics]], '''displacement''' is the capability of [[language]] to communicate about things that are not immediately present (spatially or temporally); i.e., things that are either not here or are not here now.

In 1960, [[Charles F. Hockett]] proposed displacement as one of 13 [[design features of language]] that distinguish human language from [[animal communication]] systems (ACSs):

{{quote|Man is apparently almost unique in being able to talk about things that are remote in space or time (or both) from where the talking goes on. This feature—"displacement"—seems to be definitely lacking in the vocal signaling of man's closest relatives, though it does occur in bee-dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Charles F. |last=Hockett |authorlink=Charles F. Hockett |title=The origin of speech |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=203 |pages=88–96 |url=http://www.isrl.illinois.edu/~amag/langev/paper/charles60theOrigin.html |accessdate=19 February 2011 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0960-88 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426023122/http://www.isrl.illinois.edu/~amag/langev/paper/charles60theOrigin.html |archivedate=26 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In animal communication systems==
[[Honeybee]]s use the [[waggle dance]] to communicate the location of a patch of flowers suitable for foraging. The degree of displacement in this example remains limited when compared to human language. A bee can only communicate the location of the most recent food source it has visited. It cannot communicate an idea about a food source at a specific point in the past, nor can it speculate about food sources in the future.&lt;ref name="Yule"&gt;{{Citation |first=George |last=Yule |year=2010 |title=The Study of Language |edition=4th |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-76527-5 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, displacement in the waggle dance is restricted by the language's lack of creativity and productivity. The bees can express direction and distance, but it has been experimentally determined that they lack a sign for "above". It is also doubtful that bees can communicate about non-existent nectar for the purpose of deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Paul Georg |last=Meyer |year=2005 |title=Synchronic English Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=3rd |location=[[Tübingen]] |publisher=[[Gunter Narr Verlag]] |isbn=3-8233-6191-0 |page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, in honeybee communication, the potential for displacement is limited, but it is there insofar as they have the ability to communicate about something not currently present (i.e., something that is spatially removed).

[[Ant]]s have been observed sending out scouts to patrol for food items, and coming back for other workers if the food found is too large to bring to the nest by the finder alone, for example a dead caterpillar that is too heavy. This again would involve displacement by communicating outside of the here and now.  Recruitment has also been observed by the African [[Weaver Ant]] ''Oecophylla longinoda'' for the purpose of communicating new food sources, emigration to new sites, and for defense against intruders.  Researchers have described no less than five distinct systems to fulfill these functions in this species.&lt;ref&gt;Holldobler, Bert and Wilson, Edward O. 1977.  The Multiple Recruitment Systems of the African Weaver Ant ''Oecophylla longinoda'' (Latreille) (Hymenopetera: Formicidae) ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'': 3,19-60 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ants communicate using a system composed of olfactory or scent clues from several glands together with body movements.  The animals will use antennation, body jerking, and/or mouth-opening, and will combine these clues with the application of the scent trails or scent release to pass on information regarding resources or intruders.

[[Raven]]s (''Corvus corax'') have been observed to recruit other ravens to large feeding sites, such as to the carcass of an animal. However, at first glance their motivation for recruiting is less obvious, and the specifics of their communication system are more elusive.  Still, it has been documented that ravens must have such a system, as their patterns of gathering at sites clearly indicate that they must have been informed of the presence of the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, B. Winter foraging at carcasses by three sympatric  corvids, with emphasis on recruitment by the raven, ''Corvus corax''. ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'':3, 141-156 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, B and Marzluff, J.M. Do common ravens yell because they want to attract others? ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'': 28, 13-21 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that non-mated ravens call in a group of other non-mated birds to be able to feed and not get chased away by mated territorial pairs of established ravens.

==Importance in evolution of language==
The need to convey information using displacement has been suspected to have been the [[evolutionary pressure]] leading to [[Origin of language|language development in humans]], as outlined by [[Derek Bickerton]] in ''Adam's Tongue''.&lt;ref&gt;Bickerton, Derek (2009). ''Adam's Tongue''. Hill and Wang. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-2281-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure of such need is present in species with a foraging strategy that presents the challenge of directing members of its group to a food source too large to be utilized singly or in small numbers, requiring recruitment of assistance.
{{quote|It's only when you fully appreciate what displacement means, how the absence of displacement is not just a casual feature of ACSs but a crucial defining feature of pre-human minds, that you can start getting the complete picture.| Bickerton, page 217}}
The unique environmental need selecting for a communication system capable for displacement in humans or our direct ancestors is not identified, but hypotheses include Bickerton's theory of small groups finding large herbivore carcasses, and needing the assistance from other small groups of humans to defend against other dangerous scavengers (large cats, hyenas) competing for the same source of food. Language development most certainly did not stop there—since otherwise bees or ants would have comparable communication systems to ours—but this is where it is hypothesized to have begun, giving our ancestors the ability to take communication out of the here and now.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">In [[English drama]], a '''domestic tragedy''' is a [[tragedy]] in which the tragic protagonists are ordinary middle-class or lower-class individuals. This subgenre contrasts with [[classical antiquity|classical]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[tragedy]], in which the protagonists are of kingly or [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] rank and their downfall is an affair of state as well as a personal matter. 

The [[Ancient Greek]] theorist [[Aristotle]] had argued that tragedy should concern only great individuals with great minds and souls, because their catastrophic downfall would be more emotionally powerful to the audience; only comedy should depict middle-class people. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less consequence in the wider world. 

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], the first domestic tragedies were written in the [[English Renaissance]]; one of the first was ''[[Arden of Faversham]]'' (1592), depicting the murder of a bourgeois man by his adulterous wife. Other famous examples are ''[[A Woman Killed with Kindness]]'' (1607), ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' (1608), and ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' (1621).&lt;ref name="SturgessHeywood2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith Sturgess|author2=Thomas Heywood|title=Three Elizabethan Domestic Tragedies: Arden of Faversham; a Yorkshire Tragedy; a Woman Killed with Kindness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kJ-JxlddCsC|date=23 February 2012|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-241-96146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Othello]]'' can be classified as a domestic tragedy.&lt;ref name="Benson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Benson|title=Shakespeare, 'Othello' and Domestic Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jgug588s3jgC&amp;pg=PT10|date=15 December 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3766-1|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic tragedy disappeared during the era of [[Restoration drama]], when Neoclassicism dominated the stage, but it emerged again with the work of [[George Lillo]] and Sir [[Richard Steele]] in the [[Augustan drama|eighteenth century]].

'''Economics of the arts and literature'''  or '''cultural economics''' (used below for convenience) is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation, distribution, and the consumption of [[work of art|works of art]], literature and similar creative and/or cultural products.   For a long time, the concept of the "arts" were confined to visual arts (e.g., painting) and performing arts (music, theatre, dance) in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of [[cultural industry]] (cinema, television programs, book and periodical publishing and music publishing) and the economy of cultural institutions (museums, libraries, historic buildings).  The field is coded as [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|JEL: Z11]] in the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' [[JEL classification codes|classification system]] used for article searches.&lt;ref&gt;In the JEL system, '[[Cultural economics|Cultural Economics]]' is a [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|broader category]] than used in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Alejandro Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Painter Alejandro Plaza at work on a canvas. Once this painting is complete, it will be a unique good, for which there is no exact substitute]]
Cultural economics is concerned with the arts in a broad sense. The goods considered have creative content, but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good. Designer goods such as clothes and drapes are not considered usually to be works of art or culture. Cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics. (For further considerations, see also [[Cultural Institutions Studies]]). Economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia, including pollution, corruption and education.

Works of art and culture have a specific quality, which is their uniqueness. While other economic goods, such as [[crude oil]] or [[wheat]] are generic, interchangeable commodities (given a specific grade of the product), there is only one example of a famous painting such as the [[Mona Lisa]], and only one example of Rodin's well-known sculpture "[[The Thinker]]". While copies or reproductions can be made of these works of art, and while many inexpensive posters of the Mona Lisa and small factory-made replicas of "The Thinker" are sold, neither full-size copies nor inexpensive reproductions are viewed as substitutes for the real artworks, in the way that a consumer views a pound of Grade A sugar from Cuba as a fully equivalent substitute for a pound of Grade A sugar from United States or Dominican Republic.  As there is no equivalent item or substitute for these famous works of art, classical economist [[Adam Smith]] held it was impossible to value them. [[Alfred Marshall]] noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption: The more you have listened to a particular kind of music, the more you appreciate. In his economic framework, these goods do not have the usual decreasing [[marginal utility]].

Key academic works in cultural economics include those of [[William Baumol|Baumol]] and [[William G. Bowen|Bowen]] (Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma, 1966), of [[Gary Becker]] on addictive goods, and of [[Alan Peacock]] (public choice). This summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts, on the market of individual pieces of art, the art market in cultural industries, the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector.

== Performing arts: Baumol and cultural economics ==
[[File:Lux Video Theatre rehearsal 1951.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This picture shows actors rehearsing for a play in 1951. Despite the numerous technological advances in between 1951 and the 2010s, in the 2010s, it would still require the same number of actors to perform this play. For this reason, scholars argue that some cultural industries are not getting more efficient the way other industries, such as accounting and banking, are; these latter two industries require far fewer workers in the 2010s due to the development of computer programs.]]
The seminal paper by William Baumol and Bowen introduced the term [[Baumol's cost disease|cost disease]] for a relative cost growth of live performances. This cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies. It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself. To understand this phenomenon, compare the change in the cost of performing the [[Molière]] play "[[Tartuffe]]" in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger. In 1664, you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Molière's play, and it would take, say, twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger. In 2007, a single accountant with a $10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes, but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Molière play. Artists must make a considerable investment in [[human capital]] (e.g., training), and needs to be paid accordingly. The artists' pay needs to rise along with that of the population in general. As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy, the cost of a play will rise with general productivity, while the actors' productivity does not rise.

There are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts:

*The first concentrates on the existence of productivity growth in some areas of production, thus contradicting the relevance of cost disease. Staying with the "Tartuffe" example, the same performance can be viewed by an ever-larger audience by improvements in the design of theatres, and by the introduction of microphones, television and recording.
*The second is concerned with the allocation of subsidies to the cultural sector. While these should be in the general public interest, they may have an income distribution effect, e.g. if they reduce cost to the relatively well-off part of society. This is the case when the well-off are overrepresented in the audiences of subsidized plays, or when subsidies go to a small elitist group of artists.

== Market for artworks ==
Two segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished: works of art that are familiar and have a history, and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries. Both markets, however, are [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]], i.e., there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers ([[oligopsony]]). Two central questions on the working of the markets are: How are prices determined, and what is the [[rate of return|return]] on artworks, compared to the return on financial assets?

=== Price determination ===
Components of a work of art, like raw stone, tubes of paint or unpainted canvas, in general have a value much lower than the finished products, such as a sculpture or a finished painting. Also, the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art. It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers', and experts' perception of it. This perception has three elements: First, social value, which is the social status the buyer has by owning it. The artist thus has an "artistic capital". Second, the artistic value, compared to contemporary works, or as importance to later generations. Third, the price history of the item, if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again (given the oligopolistic market structure).
Three kinds of economic agents determine these values. Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors use the first, social value. Experts like art historians and art professors use the second, artistic value. Buyers who buy works of art as an investment use the third, the price history and expectations for future price increases.

=== Art market and investment ===
[[File:Asrlar Sadosi2012b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fine art such as paintings are typically sold at [[auction]]s.]]
Some major financial institutions, banks and insurance companies, have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the 1990s. These rates have not slowed down at the same time as the rates on [[stock exchange]]s, in the early 90's. This may indicate a [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] opportunity. Apart from this evidence of successful investment, the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market. Many works are sold on [[auction]]s. These transactions are thus very transparent. This has made it possible to establish price databases, with prices of some items going back to 1652. Empirical studies have shown that, on average, the [[rate of return|return]] on works of art has been lower than that on [[stock|equity]], with a [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] that is at least as high. An [[intangible asset|intangible]] gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly. However, before interpreting the figures, it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes. In 1986, Baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of 0.55 percent for works of art, against a rate of return of 2.5 percent for financial assets, over a 20-year period.

== Cultural industries ==
Some famous artworks such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' painting are not reproducible (at least in the sense of creating another copy that would be seen as equivalent in value), but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on a single, individual copy. Books, recordings, movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original. These are the products of major cultural industries, which are the book industry, the music industry and the film industry. These markets are characterized by:
* '''Uncertainty of value'''. The demand for a good (market success) is hard to predict. For example, with movies, even if a film's plot, themes and selection of actors has been extensively tested using focus groups and polls, and even if the movie uses popular [[A-list]] actors, this film may still be a [[box office bomb]] (e.g., ''[[Gigli]]'', a 2003 American romantic comedy starring [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]). On the other hand, a low-budget film by an unknown director and an unknown cast, such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' can surprise the industry by being a major hit. This uncertainty is a characteristic of an [[experience good]] such as films, TV shows, musical theatre shows and music concerts.
* '''Infinite variety'''. You can differentiate between regular consumer products, e.g. cars, on basis of its characteristics. For example, a hatchback can be purchased from a number of manufacturers with a set list of options (e.g., automatic transmission, standard transmission, convertible, etc.), with the different options requiring different charges. Many general products allow classification on a relatively small number of such characteristics. Cultural goods, however, have a very high number of characteristics, which, on top of that, often are subjective. For example, an early 1990s band with loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] could be considered to be [[grunge]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[heavy metal music]] or [[alternative rock]] by different [[music critic]]s.  This makes cultural products hard to compare.
* '''High concentration in the products which are traded or sold'''. A major part of sales of cultural goods is in a very small number of [[bestseller]]s (e.g., with books), [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s (movies) or hit [[Single (music)|single]]s (pop music).
* '''Short [[product life cycle management|life cycle]]'''. Most cultural items are sold/traded shortly after their introduction or production. Some cultural goods, such as broadcast news, have little or no market value shortly after the broadcast. Of course, some cultural products may retain saleability for years or even decades, as with the small number of films that become [[cult movie]]s (e.g., ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'') or certain classic novels or albums that have enduring appeal (the "[[back catalogue]]" of a record label).
* '''High [[fixed cost]]s'''. There is high cost before introduction of a new artwork or cultural product. Making a movie can cost millions of dollars; however the marginal cost of making an additional copy of the DVD may cost less than a dollar.

=== Market structure ===
The important cultural industries tend to have an [[oligopolistic]] [[market structure]]. The market is dominated by a few major companies, with the rest of the market consisting of many small companies. The latter may act as a filter or as "gatekeepers" for the artistic supply. A small company with a successful artist or good quality roster can be bought by one of the major companies. Big conglomerates, pooling TV and film production, have existed for decades. The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such, and mergers of hardware producers with content providers. Anticipated gains from [[synergy]] and [[market power]] have not been realised, and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines.

== Economics of cultural heritage ==
[[Cultural heritage]] is reflected in goods and real estate. Management and [[regulatory economics|regulation]] of museums has come under study in this area.

=== Museums ===
[[File:The Otsuka Museum of Art20s3200.jpg|thumb|right200px|The [[Otsuka Museum of Art]] in Japan.]]
Museums, which have a conservatory role, and provide exhibitions to the general public, can be commercial, or on a non-profit base. In the second case, as they provide a [[public good]], they pose the problems related to these goods: should they be self-financing, or be subsidized ? One of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums, and their budgets. Also, they are often located in places (city centres) where the cost of land is high, which limits their expansion possibilities. American museums exhibit only about half of their collection. Some museums in Europe, like the Pompidou Centre in France, show less than 5 percent of their collection. Apart from providing exhibitions, museums get proceeds from derived products, like catalogues and reproductions. They also produce at a more intangible level: They make collections. Out of so many pieces in the public domain, they make a selection based on their expertise, thus adding value to the mere existence of the items.

The dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice. On the one hand the museum has, for conservation reasons, an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible, and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience, to promote knowledge and research. On the other hand, the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures, to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience. When a government has made a choice about this, application of economic [[contract theory]] will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers (on the financial, conservatory side) to obtain the required result.

=== Real estate and buildings  ===
[[File:Wr Neustaedter Dom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In many countries, historic buildings such as cathedrals are considered to be "heritage buildings" and as such they are protected against demolition or substantial modifications.]]
Many countries have systems that protect historically significant buildings and structures. These are buildings or other structures that are deemed to have cultural importance or which are deemed to have heritage value. Owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration, in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access. Buildings that are often classified as heritage buildings include former or current Parliament buildings, cathedrals, courthouses, houses built in a recognized historical style, and even fairly regular houses, if the house was formerly the home of a famous [[politician]], [[artist]] or inventor. Buildings with heritage status cannot typically be demolished. Depending on the nature of the heritage restrictions, the current owner may or may not be allowed to modify the outside or inside of the building. Such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do. There has been little study of this issue.

== Artists' labour market ==
The [[labour market]] for artists is characterized by:
* There is an '''extremely unequal [[income distribution]]''' within the market segment. A very small group of artists earn a high proportion of the total income, while the average income is low.
* There is a '''structural excess supply of labour'''. There are always more people who would like to earn their income as an artist than there is demand for artists and artworks. For example, there are far more young [[indie rock]] bands aspiring to careers in music than there are available paid contracts in the recording industry. Due to this excess supply of labour, a [[nightclub]] owner has so many local young bands requesting to play at her venue that she can offer them little or no payment for their performance.
* There are '''intangible returns to labour''', also called "nonpecuniary benefits" (this means non-financial, non-wage benefits). For example, a musician is able to spend her days creating beautiful music and working with other creative people, which is very satisfying. Due to these intangible returns, artists are often willing to accept lower wages than their qualifications would earn in a different market. For example, working with a famous musician may provide such great intangible benefits (e.g., it is exciting to meet and work with such a well-known performer) that a [[record producer]] may be able to ask musicians to record with the start musician for little or no payment.
* '''Non-separation of artist and work'''. While some workers in the cultural industries do not make a strong connection between their work tasks and their self-identity, for some types of artists, such as painters, sculptors and filmmakers, the image their artwork or creative output gives them is important to artists' sense of self. Whether this phenomenon occurs depends on a number of factors, such as the type of artistic job and individuals' perceptions. In the 2010s, many famous [[film director]]s view the movies they direct as directly identified with their artistic vision. However, an assistant director leading scenes in [[action film]]s may see him or herself as a worker in a cultural industry, and he/she may not feel artistically identified with the film's he/she works on.

=== Star system ===
[[File:Evan Rachel Wood (April 2009) 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sherwin Rosen]] states that top stars have such high earnings because their movies sell more copies.]]
The term [[superstar (celebrity)|"star system"]], coined by [[Sherwin Rosen]], is used to explain why a very small number of the artists and creators in the market, such as the celebrity [[A-list]] actors and top [[pop singer]]s, earn most of the total earnings in a sector. Rosen's 1981 paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why “relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage.” Rosen argues that in superstar markets, "small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue." Rosen points out that "...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices".

In cultural industries, the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a key role in this. The consumer does not really know how good the product is, until he or she has consumed it (think of a movie), and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry. The consumer looks for guidance in the price, reputation, or a famous name on the cover or poster. As the producer understands this using a famous director, actor or singer affects demand, he or she is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality (a star). Indeed, authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance: in a musical contest, results were highly correlated with the order of performance. This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive: given the extreme gains of a star, and an irrational behaviour, or particular preferences, with respect to chance, unsuccessful artists keep trying, even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade, such as waiting tables. A second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists' labour in terms of social status and lifestyle. For example, even a struggling [[DJ]] spends most of her time onstage on [[nightclub]]s and [[rave]]s, which for some people is a desirable outcome.

=== Production structure ===
[[File:Set design by Philippe Chaperon for Act4 sc2 of Aida by Verdi 1880 Paris.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A painter who does canvases that hang in major museums and a professional set painter for opera or theatre are both skilled painters who do painting for a living. However, the former is more likely to view her/his paintings as part of her artistic expression and identity, whereas the latter is more likely to view her/himself as a craftsperson.]]

A case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods . (See [[Cultural Institutions Studies]].) An artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself, while the ordinary craftsperson is only concerned with his product, as far as it affects his/her pay or salary. For example, a painter who creates artworks that are displayed in museums may view her paintings as her artistic expression. On the other hand, a scene painter for a music theatre company may see herself as a craftsperson who is paid by the hour for doing painting. The artist may thus want restrict the use of his or her product, and he/she may object if a museum uses a reproduction of his/her painting to help sell cars or liquor. On the other hand, the scene painter may not object to commercial re-uses of her set painting, as she/he may see it just as a regular job.

'''Figurae''' (singular, ''figura'') are the non-signifying constituents of signifiers ([[Sign (semiotics)|signs]]). For example, letters of the alphabet are the figurae that comprise a written word (signifier).  In the [[semiotic]] language of [[Louis Hjelmslev]], the coiner of this term, figurae serve only to distinguish elements (e.g. words) of the expression plane from each other, independently from the content plane.   That is, the letter B, in the written word expression "bat", distinguishes "bat" from the word  "sat", but neither B nor S bears meaning on its own.  On the other hand, the constituents "foot" and "ball" both bear their own individual meanings, such that in the word "football", they cannot be considered figurae, although their individual letters can.  Hjelmslev states that in a given language a "legion of signs" can be constructed with a "handful of figurae" through ever new arrangements of them.&lt;ref name="Hjelmslev"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists often use the terms [[phonemes]] and [[morphemes]] to refer, respectively, to the figurae and the signifiers of human languages.

The division of the stream of speech into meaningful morphemes plus their further subdivision into meaningless elements is known as the [[double articulation]].  This [[duality of patterning]] of language is one of the few facts of language which most schools of linguistics can agree on.   Occasionally, two morphemes can combine in an arbitrary way into a new morpheme, as in double names such as ''Mary-Alice, John-Paul'', and ''Sarah-Jean,'' creating a kind of triple articulation.  English speakers recognize ''Mary'' and ''Alice'' as parts of the name ''Mary-Alice,'' yet they understand that a woman of that name is in no way a combination of two other women.   But neither are double given names typical of English, nor are surnames meaningless, since surnames usually identify a family relationship.   As far as the combination of meaningful elements is concerned, there is much less agreement on what constitutes a [[syntagm]] (e.g. ''foot-ball, I-am'') and whether any such syntax is universal.

In theory, any sign could be composed of figurae, but care must be taken in distinguishing between the control-number-like function of figurae (as in the individual digits of a telephone extension) and the syntax-like function of meaning constituents (as in the area code of a full telephone number).   For example, the symbols for the lines of the New York City subway system are composed of very elementary parts, e.g., letters or numbers and colors.   While the assignment of letters to trains is arbitrary, and colors are arbitrarily assigned to various avenues in Manhattan,  the combination of a letter or number and color is not arbitrary.  That is, the symbol for the A Train has to be blue, since it runs along Eighth Avenue and all other Eighth Avenue train symbols are blue.   Therefore, these colors cannot be considered figurae.   

On the other hand, the flags of a dozen countries consist of three horizontal bars, distinguished by their colors.   It can be said that the colors and bars form a system of signifiers, consisting of the color figurae in a vertical order.  For example, the flag of Russia is made up of a white, a blue, and a red bar, from top to bottom, whereas the flag of Estonia consists of a blue, a black and a white bar.  From the point of view of a [[vexillologist]], the colors have no meaning until they are grouped together and form the national symbol.   Although white, blue and red may be "national colors" of Russia, combined in a different order they form the flag of Luxembourg.

In reality, most national flags do not conform to the three-horizontal-band pattern.  Furthermore, national flags vary somewhat in their horizontal and vertical proportions, and shades of colors can differ.  Nevertheless, this logical analysis of flags into horizontal-color-bar figurae, though not exact, would probably be arrived at by almost anyone comparing these 12 national symbols.  But it is also possible to over-analyze signs.  For example, a television picture of a flag would consist of thousands of meaningless pixels.   A recording of speech could be digitalized on a CD into millions of meaningless bits.  Neither of these mechanical divisions could be considered figurae.  It would seem, then, that since signs are defined as entities recognized by sentient beings (including many animal species), the constituents of signs, figurae, must also be easily recognizable as entities, even though they have no meaning in themselves.   It probably requires lot of specialization or intelligence to mentally process figurae, since it demands not only the disassociation of the characteristics of a symbol with those of its referent, but this disassociation has to be repeated for each figura that comprises the arbitrary symbol.   Figurae have not yet been recognized in any non-human natural communication system.  Although the honeybee [[waggle dance]] may involve some arbitrary symbols, they are combined with non-arbitrary ones, much like the subway line symbols.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7013">'''Folk linguistics''' is the [[amateur]] study of [[linguistics]]. The term is often used as a [[pejorative]].

The [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Ray Jackendoff]] points out that applying folk linguistics to education can be potentially damaging to the attainment of students who speak [[less standard dialect]]s. Characterising different speech as ''good'' or ''bad'' can have a serious effect.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

The term ''folk linguistics'' can also refer to [[ideological]]&lt;ref name=BerGr&gt;{{cite book|last=Gröschel |first=Bernhard| authorlink=Bernhard Gröschel |year=2009  |language=German |title=Das Serbokroatische zwischen Linguistik und Politik: mit einer Bibliographie zum postjugoslavischen Sprachenstreit |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics: With a Bibliography of the Post-Yugoslav Language Dispute |series=Lincom Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; vol 34 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |pages=147, 312–329 |isbn=978-3-929075-79-3 |oclc=428012015 |lccn=2009473660 |ol=15295665W}}&lt;/ref&gt; ideas of language, such as [[nationalist]]&lt;ref name=KordiJin&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=2010 |language=Serbo-Croatian |title=Jezik i nacionalizam |trans-title=Language and Nationalism |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf |deadurl=no |series=Rotulus Universitas |location=Zagreb |publisher=Durieux |pages=116–119 |isbn=978-953-188-311-5 |lccn=2011520778 |oclc=729837512 |ol=15270636W |archivedate=8 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690BiBe4T?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; views of language. The scientific understanding of language by linguists often contradicts that of native speakers.&lt;ref name=BerGr/&gt;&lt;ref name=KordiJin/&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|List of common misconceptions about language learning}}

Jackendoff (2003){{Ref label|a|a|none}} cites the following statements as typical examples of folk-linguistic beliefs.

* Claim: "Parents teach their children to talk". Adults assume that children either learn language directly from their parents or via simple [[imitation]]. 
** On the contrary, research in child [[language acquisition]] shows that a child acquires language more automatically, through a systematic pattern rarely noticed by adults. Although interaction with parents, adults and other children is crucial, it is actually very difficult to "correct" a child. Instead most children are able to learn to speak native languages (including those of their peers of the same age) through a process called "acquisition".{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Any [[speech error|error]]s noticed by a parent are often self-corrected by the child weeks or months later.
* Claim: "Children will get confused if they try to speak more than one language". Many parents are afraid a child cannot sort out input from multiple languages. 
** In reality, children can easily become [[simultaneous bilingualism|bilingual]] (native proficiency in two languages) if they are exposed to more than one language. There may be period of confusion, but most children are able to segregate two distinct grammars.
* Claim: "There is a proper, correct English".  Speakers generally value an educated form of the language, often its written form, and that other [[dialect]]al/spoken forms are considered structurally inferior or "sloppy", and speakers of these forms are often regarded as "stupid, lazy, sloppy, hick" or other pejorative terms.  
** However, linguists generally agree that dialectal forms such as [[AAVE|African American Vernacular English (AAVE)]]  have the same grammatical complexity as a standard English. Folk linguistic beliefs view these forms as inferior, and as a result speakers of non-standard forms often suffer forms of linguistic discrimination.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}
* Claim: "The modern language is going downhill". [[linguistic purism|Purist]]s opine that changes in the spoken language (e.g. [[new word]]s, innovations in grammar, new pronunciation patterns) are generally regarded as being detrimental rather than just change.
** In fact, living languages are not static. Their evolution is not just a modern phenomenon.

Other beliefs may include:
* A belief that a language's grammar can negatively influence and restrict how people think. This is also known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis|strong Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]. Although some linguists do advocate a form of this, many linguists reject this as being too simplistic.{{Ref label|b|b|none}} For instance, just because a language does not formally distinguish "he" vs. "she" in their personal pronouns does not mean that speakers do not distinguish and treat men and women differently. Similarly, just because English lacks a formal [[hodiernal tense]] does not mean that English speakers cannot distinguish events which occur "today" versus those on another day.
* Examples of [[folk etymology]] such as interpreting ''[[asparagus]]'' as "sparrow-grass".{{Ref label|b|b|none}} These are cases where speakers deduce an incorrect word origin. Another folk etymology is the assumption that the New York place name ''[[Fishkill, New York|Fishkill]]'' (on [[Fishkill Creek]]) means a place to kill fish. In reality, ''[[kill (creek)|-kill]]'' is from a Dutch word meaning "creek" (found also in river names such as [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wallkill River|Wallkill, New Jersey]]). However the folk etymology caused animal rights groups such as [[PETA]] to demand that the town should be renamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A fishy name will stay the same|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9609/06/fishy.name/| publisher=CNN|date=September 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Freedom Trail''' is a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} path through [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], that passes by 16 locations significant to the [[history of the United States]]. Marked largely with brick, it winds between [[Boston Common]] to the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]]. Stops along the trail include simple explanatory ground markers, graveyards, notable churches and buildings, and a historic naval frigate. While most of the sites are free or suggest donations, the [[Old South Meeting House]], the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old State House]], and the [[Paul Revere House]] charge admission. The Freedom Trail is overseen by the City of Boston's Freedom Trail Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/ |title=Freedom Trail |publisher=City of Boston |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported in part by grants from various nonprofits and foundations, private philanthropy, and [[Boston National Historical Park]].

The Freedom Trail was conceived by local journalist William Schofield, who in 1951 suggested building a pedestrian trail to link important local landmarks. Boston mayor [[John Hynes (politician)|John Hynes]] decided to put Schofield's idea into action. By 1953, 40,000 people were walking the trail annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Northeastern University Press |isbn = 1-55553-161-X |publication-place = Boston |title = Building a new Boston: politics and urban renewal, 1950–1970 |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1737146M/Building_a_new_Boston |author = O'Connor, Thomas H. |publication-date = 1993 |id = 155553161X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Park Service operates a visitor's center on the first floor of Faneuil Hall, where they offer tours, provide free maps of the Freedom Trail and other historic sites, and sell books about Boston and United States history.

Some observers have noted the tendency of the Freedom Trail's [[Framing (social sciences)|narrative frame]] to omit certain historical locations, such as the sites of the [[Boston Tea Party]] and the [[Liberty Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Trouble with the Freedom Trail |author=Alfred F. Young |date=21 Mar 2004 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genetic editing''' ([[French language|French]] ''critique génétique''; [[German language|German]] ''genetische Kritik'') is an approach to scholarly editing in which an [[Exemplar (textual criticism)|exemplar]] is seen as derived from a dossier of other [[manuscript]]s and events. The derivation can be through physical [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]]; writing or drawing in a variety of media; quotation, [[annotation]] or correction; acts of physical defacement; etc.  Genetic editing aims to reconstruct the sequence of actions on the manuscript and exactly which parts of the manuscript were acted upon. Where multiple manuscripts have been combined (through for example cut and paste or quotation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textualscholarship.org/gencrit/index.html|title=Textual Scholarship: Genetic Criticism|date=|work=textualscholarship.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cts.dmu.ac.uk/index.php?q=objectives.html] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30227768|title=The "Wake's Progress": Toward a Genetic Edition|first=Dirk|last=Van Hulle|date=17 January 2018|publisher=|journal=Text|volume=13|pages=221–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic editing is strong in European, particularly French and German, [[textual scholarship]]. Completed works of genetic editing are known as genetic editions.

Whereas traditional scholarly editing can be seen as constructing a new document drawing together and comparing many source documents to cast light on a work, genetic editing closely examines a single [[Extant literature|extant]] manuscript and traces back each aspect to cast light on the work.

Genetic editing is named by analogy with genetics manuscripts (individuals) are derived from other manuscripts (or previous states of the same manuscript) and with the derivation tree being a partial [[Tree (data structure)|ordered tree]].

The [[Text Encoding Initiative]]'s [[XML]] format has support for encoding of genetic editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PH-changes|title=TEI Guidelines 11.7 Identifying Changes and Revisions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19609">'''Hack''' is a term used primarily in [[stand-up comedy]], but also [[sketch comedy]], [[improv comedy]], and [[comedy writing]] to refer to a joke or premise for a joke that is considered obvious, has been frequently used by [[comedian]]s in the past, and/or is blatantly copied from its original author.  Alternatively, it may refer to a [[comedian]] or performance group that uses hack material or similarly unoriginal devices in their act.  Since comedians and people who work with comedians are typically exposed to many more jokes than the general public, they may recognize a topic, joke or performer as hack before the general public does; as a result, even performers who do well on stage may be considered hacks by their peers.

The word "hack" is derived from the British term "hackneyed" meaning, "over used and thus cheapened, or trite".&lt;ref name="stasonhack"&gt;"http://stason.org/TULARC/art/hack-stand-up-comedy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally a performer will be one of the first to develop a joke about a specific topic, and later on others will follow suit to excess.  This renders the topic "hack" to new performers, but is not considered a detriment to the originator of the material.

Reusing humor can also be [[joke thievery]] if it is taken without permission from another specific comedian.

==History==
From the [[Borscht Belt|Catskill]] and [[Vaudeville]] beginnings of [[stand-up comedy]], hacking was common&lt;ref name="radartake_3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_3.php |title=From The Magazine : Radar Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122182110/http://radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_3.php |archive-date=2009-01-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade.

In the late fifties and early sixties, [[Will Jordan]] perfected a caricature performance of [[Ed Sullivan]] (incorporating mispronouncing the word "show" as "shoe") that became the basis for all other impersonators that followed.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;  Soon after, [[Jackie Mason]], [[Rich Little]] and others began adapting Jordan's caricature to their own acts. This resulted in many of Jordan's shows being canceled due to other performers doing his bit two weeks previous to his shows at the same venue.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt; [[John Byner]], in turn, developed his own, oft-imitated, version of Jordan's caricature that [[George Carlin]] cited as being set up with the words, "Now you know!"

In the sixties, comedy took a turn for the more personal. Comics like [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Richard Pryor]], and George Carlin were no longer regurgitating joke after joke, but instead were offering insight to their own lives from a comedic point of view. As a result, jokes and persona were largely unique to the performer. Hacking proved more difficult, but also more offensive to the writer.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

In the seventies joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The eighties and nineties saw the popularity of stand-up comedy continue to increase. With the advent of pay-cable networks, comics were afforded the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft wherein the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.

For many years, [[Denis Leary]] had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1992 album ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt Leary had stolen his act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=Kevin Booth and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 | title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903194637/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 |archivedate = September 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= Rogan |first=Joe |work= Playboy Magazine |date= October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |title= Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions |author= Tim McIntire |year=1998 |publisher= BillHicks.com |archivedate= 2006-03-20 |accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from [[pancreatic cancer]], an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; "Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer").&lt;ref name="hicksfaq" /&gt;

Also in the nineties, began a nearly universal hack of an impression of [[Bill Cosby]], the style of which was first unveiled by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his concert ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw|Raw]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/19/movies/eddie-murphy-raw.html | title='Eddie Murphy Raw'  | author=Janet Maslin | publisher=New York Times | year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent times have seen public rivalries between comics over the subject of hacking. [[Louis CK]] has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with [[Dane Cook]] over three bits on Cook's album, ''Retaliation'' that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on CK's album ''Live in Houston''. This claim is further complicated by both artists having performed bits on naming kids that strongly resemble "My Real Name", a bit from [[Steve Martin]]'s album, ''A Wild and Crazy Guy''.&lt;ref name="dead frog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Todd |url=http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/steal_this_joke_louis_ck_vs_dane_cook_vs_steve_martin/ |title=Steal this Joke: Louis C.K. vs. Dane Cook vs. Steve Martin &amp;#124; Dead-Frog - A Comedy Blog |publisher=Dead-Frog |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2010}}

[[Joe Rogan]], by contrast has been very open in accusing [[Carlos Mencia]] of hacking.&lt;ref name="monstersandcritics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1265383.php/Joe_Rogan_confronts_Carlos_Mencia_at_Comedy_Store |title=Joe Rogan confronts Carlos Mencia at Comedy Store - People |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Italian comic and satirist Daniele Luttazzi was accused of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Robert Schimmel]].&lt;ref name="rep_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/06/09/news/luttazzi-secopia-4703064/ |title=La Rete contro Luttazzi: "Copia" I dubbi dei fan, il tam-tam cresce - Repubblica.it |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html|title=Luttazzi copia - Parte 1|accessdate=2010-06-11|work=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612084318/http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html|archive-date=2010-06-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But five years before those charges, Luttazzi himself told about his scheme on his personal blog: he wrote that he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against [[La7]] broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show "Decameron", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. La7 shall pay Luttazzi 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_10/satira-tv-luttazzi-vince-causa-contro-la-7-franco_69183226-6a83-11e1-8b63-010bde402ef9.shtml |title= Luttazzi vince la causa contro La7 |date= 10 March 2012 |accessdate= 10 March 2012 |publisher= corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi calls his ruse "the Lenny Bruce trick" after a similar trick played by his hero, Lenny Bruce. Luttazzi asked his readers to find out the original jokes. He awards a prize to anyone who finds a "nugget", i.e. a reference to famous jokes: he calls the game "treasure hunt".&lt;ref name="blo_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/144|title=Caccia al tesoro|accessdate=2005-10-24 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi also calls the charges "naive", explaining why those jokes are not "plagiarized", but "calqued", which is a fair use of original material. He uses a joke by Emo Philips to prove that the meaning of a joke depends on its context.&lt;ref name="blo_lut2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/811|title=Tecnica della diffamazione moderna|accessdate=2010-10-15 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi's blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works.&lt;ref name="blo_lut3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/324|title=Caccia al tesoro|accessdate=2007-12-11 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, one of the contestants on the talent quest television program ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' was Jordan Paris, whose act was stand-up comedy. His act went well, the judges were impressed, and he made it through to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, G 2011, '[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/australias-got-plagiarism-ripoff-comic-exposed-20110526-1f50v.html Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed]', ''Brisbane Times'' 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians [[Lee Mack]] and [[Geoff Keith]]. The television network eventually decided to give him a chance to redeem himself and he was allowed to compete in the semi-final, provided he use his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well - "I just sacked my two writers - Copy and Paste" - had been done in 2009 by comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]], about [[Brad Garrett]], at a roast of [[Joan Rivers]]. Ross had said, "This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste."&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, D 2011, [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oops-he-did-it-again-ripoff-comic-plunders-joke-about-plagiarism-20110629-1gq1d.html 'Oops.

In January 2012, Blogger and comedian [[Troy Holm]] was ridiculed on the [[social networking]] site [[Facebook]]&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Troy-Holm/217011661714006 |title=Occupy Troy Holm |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for stealing jokes and stories from comedian [[Doug Stanhope]] and posting them to his Blog from 2010, [[plagiarism|claiming them as his own work]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701002315/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including Stanhope's "Fuck someone uglier than you" routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154727/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |archive-date=2012-01-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found on Stanhope's Acid Bootleg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Stanhope/ACID+Bootleg |title=ACID Bootleg – Doug Stanhope – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Stanhope |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko_%28album%29 |title=Sicko (album) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}} nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701001921/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the "Occupy Troy Holm" Movement.&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;  Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that "To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that ''isn't'' mine?"&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;

==Hacking in the media==
Hacking is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often entire premises in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.

[[Dick Cavett]] and [[Woody Allen]] often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other.

Allen's jokes and topics were regularly stolen by the highly successful [[television]] show, ''[[Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="Cavett interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/cavett.htm |title=SHECKY! Interview: DICK CAVETT! |publisher=Sheckymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved extremely painful to Allen.

Several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]", and "[[The Italian Bob]]" have poked fun at ''Family Guy'', implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from ''The Simpsons''. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | title = Interview: Matt Groening | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | author = Nathan Rabin | date = 2006-04-26 | work = The A.V. Club | publisher = Onion Inc. | quote = The rivalry is very affectionate...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familyguy.tktv.net/news.html |title=Timeline at familyguy.tktv.net|quote=You know, it's funny. Matt Groening and I actually have a great relationship...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recourse and consequences==
There is, historically, very little [[legal recourse]] taken in cases of hacking. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. [[W. C. Fields]] reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a hack comic's legs broken.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

Typically, the repercussions of hacking are limited to personal animosity. On this issue, it sometimes appears that the offended comics are alone in their concern. For example, on February 10, 2007 at the [[Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles, Joe Rogan argued on-stage with Carlos Mencia, accusing him of hacking other comedians' work. According to Rogan's account, he had just finished his act and introduced the next performer, [[Ari Shaffir]], as a comedian who opens for "Carlos Men-steal-ia".&lt;ref name="rogan-video"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=53945 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407105943/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=53945 |archive-date=2007-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mencia took offense and walked on the stage. The Comedy Store later cancelled Rogan's shows and suggested he "take a break" from the Comedy Store, which was then followed by Rogan's manager (who also manages Mencia) dropping Rogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070215/ENTERTAIN/70215009 |title=Joe Rogan and Carlos Mencia face off at comedy club |accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire incident was filmed as part of Rogan's internet reality show, ''JoeShow''. It was then made available to watch or download at numerous websites, including Rogan's.&lt;ref name="rogan-video"/&gt;

Joe Rogan said, "People take plagiarism so seriously in all other forms of media, whether it's music, newspapers, books, but with comedy, it's like, 'You're on your own, fucker.'"&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

The [[internet]], however, has opened up a new medium for "outing" a hack. Websites like [[YouTube]] allow users to upload videos and share them with others. This has made it much easier to show evidence of joke thievery in a public forum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In January 2012, Troy Holm, an amateur Comic, stole several jokes from [[Doug Stanhope]] and posted them to his [[blog]] under the guise of having written them, himself. Stanhope discovered the blog and tipped-off his fans who then deluged Holms blog with negative and berating comments. The blog has since been taken down.&lt;ref name="Laughspin Stanhope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughspin.com/2012/01/04/comedian-blatantly-steals-doug-stanhopes-material-fans-revolt |title=Comedian blatantly steals Doug Stanhope’s material, fans revolt |publisher=Laughspin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roadrunner Records Stanhope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Records |first=Roadrunner |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Doug-Stanhope-Punishes-A-Plagiarist-23921.aspx |title=Doug Stanhope Punishes A Plagiarist |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Rosenthal]] and [[Steve Silberberg]] have published a ''Guide to Hack'' to help new comics avoid hacking,&lt;ref name="stason hack"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stas Bekman: stas (at) stason.org |url=http://stason.org/TULARC/art/hack-stand-up-comedy/ |title=The Complete Guide To Hack Stand-Up Comedy |publisher=Stason.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which references (and gives credit to) an earlier work on the same subject by [[Andy Kindler]] called, ''The Hacks Handbook: A Starter Kit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nathansmart.com/akhh.pdf |title=Handbook |website=www.nathansmart.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kindler national lampoon"&gt;NATIONAL LAMPOON February 1991 pp. 34-36&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heritage science''' is cross-disciplinary scientific research of [[cultural heritage]]. It encompasses research enabling access to [[cultural heritage]], its [[Art conservation|conservation]], [[Interpretation (aesthetics)|interpretation]] and [[management]].

The term has become widely used after 2006 when it became increasingly evident that the more traditional terms [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] or preservation science inadequately reflected the breadth of research into [[cultural heritage]]. Heritage scientists in museums, galleries, libraries, archives, universities and research institutions support conservation (often called [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]]), access (e.g. development of new [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] tools), interpretation, including [[archaeometry]] and [[archaeological science]] (e.g. dating, [[Provenance|provenancing]], attribution), heritage management (e.g. development of tools and knowledge supporting strategic or environmental management decisions) and wider societal engagement with heritage (e.g. heritage [[Value (ethics)|values and ethics]]). Heritage science is also an excellent vehicle for public engagement with science as well as heritage.

Heritage science is seen as "key to the long-term sustainability of heritage: it is about managing change and risk and maximising social, cultural and economic benefit not just today, but in such a way that we can pass on to future generations that which we have inherited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/256/256.pdf |format=PDF |title=Science and Technology Committee : Science and Heritage |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domains of research, where heritage science makes a particular input were recognised to be museums, galleries, libraries and archives; the built historic environment and archaeology, by the United Kingdom National Heritage Science Strategy documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/strategy.php | title=UK National Heritage Science Strategy | accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[File:Red Rot Leather.jpg|right|thumbnail|Red rot on leather bindings was one of the first conservation issues to excite scientists.]]
The field still requires its literature canon and opinions on whether heritage science is a domain in its own right or a field of research diverge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5SpIq80XpU | title=Round Table discussion on the Future of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this appears a matter of academic recognition, rather than a matter of research practice.

Heritage science is an old field of research: in his [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] in 1843, [[Michael Faraday]] already pointed out how pollution importantly contributes to book degradation. The following premises appear to be of defining importance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heritagescienceresearch.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/theory_heritagescience/ | title=A Brief Theory of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Heritage science is inherently biased, as scientists, by doing research on heritage, contribute to its value: they create and popularize heritage through their research. 
# Heritage science is neither fundamental nor experimental: work with actual heritage objects, building or sites cannot be repeatable because heritage is not an experiment. On the other hand, the [[scientific method]] and deductive reasoning is easily applied when working with models and model objects, which heritage scientists often do due to the high value of actual historic objects and consequentially, sampling restrictions.

Since the context of heritage is often unknown, there can be any number of variables affecting the heritage system under observation – inductive reasoning is therefore often applied in heritage science. In this aspect, the premise of heritage science comes close to social science.
Heritage that is accessible, in its preserved authentic form or as a (digital) reproduction, is a "resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/library/publications/2014-heritage-communication_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe |publisher=EU |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through improved access, heritage science therefore contributes to well-being. Heritage science is proof that there is no world of [[The Two Cultures|'Two Cultures']]. A scientist, researching heritage defies the existence of the divide: there can be no scientific research of heritage without a contribution by humanities research. Heritage science also successfully bridges science and culture, because it provides an attractive vehicle to convey ideas and concepts related to technology and engineering, as well as culture and society. Heritage science can be considered an anthropogenic analog to environmental geography, which was defined by [[Halford Mackinder]] in 1887 as a discipline that aims to "bridge one of the greatest of all gaps" between "the natural sciences and the study of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacKinder|first=H. J.|date=1887|title=On the Scope and Methods of Geography|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1801248|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography|volume=9|issue=3|pages=141–174|doi=10.2307/1801248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
[[Image:WoS publications 2015.png|right|thumbnail|Publication trends in the heritage science field, 2005-2014.]]

Heritage science is an increasingly lively science domain. Materials and techniques of the past are often very difficult to study and state-of-the-art techniques and methods need to be employed. Discoveries new to science are often the result of such endeavours, e.g. new antibiotics from bacteria discovered in the [[Cave of Altamira]], in Spain. With its wide definition, heritage science spans a significant variety of scientific activities. In order to support conservation, access, interpretation and management, heritage science must be based on an [[interdisciplinary]] palette of knowledge, from fundamental sciences ([[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]]) to [[arts]] and [[humanities]] (conservation, [[archaeology]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[history]], [[art history]] etc.), including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[computer science]]s and [[engineering]].

In academia, heritage science is often performed by scientists spending a proportion of their time on heritage-related research. The academic field, judged by the number of academic outputs published annually, is steadily increasing. This could be taken to estimate the domain size – with the number of outputs in 2014 being 6,800 (Source: Web of Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ |title=ISI Web of Knowledge |publisher=Images.isiknowledge.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it could be assumed that there are about 3,000 heritage scientists active in the field (publishing on average 2 academic publications per year). This goes against the generally held view that the field is small.

The proportion per country varies greatly, about 20% of researchers being active in the US, 15% in the UK, 10% in Italy, 5% France, and 5% in China (with a strong increase in the last decade).

Since 2013, the scientific domain has its own flagship journal, ''Heritage Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/ |title=Heritage Science |publisher=Heritagesciencejournal.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Mind the Gap project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/our-role/collection-care/heritage-science-research-and-development/collaborative-working-practices-mind-the-gap/ |title= Mind the gap project |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the UK EPSRC/AHRC Science and Heritage Programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescience.ac.uk/ |title= UK AHRC/EPSRC Science and Heritage Programme |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the drivers and impediments in cross-disciplinary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mind-the-gap-report-jan-2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mind the Gap Report |publisher=AHRC |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project found that there is no gap between rigour and relevance in heritage science research but rather that there is a continuum of activity. However, there was less satisfaction with heritage science research in relation to its impact on practice, in comparison to its academic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/content/2/1/11 |title= Mind the gap: rigour and relevance in collaborative heritage science research |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:SEAHA Mobile Heritage Lab.jpg|thumbnail|The SEAHA Mobile Heritage Laboratory for field research and public engagement with science and heritage.]]
The heritage science career paths are various. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of heritage science, any academic background is suitable, from [[formal sciences]], [[natural sciences]] to [[social sciences]]. 
Most researchers have entered the field by carrying out doctoral research in the field, which is due to the fact that there is currently no undergraduate course in this domain. Since 2010, Master's degree courses in heritage science have become available at [[University College London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/heritage/programmes/mres-msc/mres-seaha |title=Heritage Science Masters at UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/gap/ProspectiveStudents/PostgraduateStudies/GraduateStudiesTaught/HeritageScience/ |title=Heritage Science Masters at Queens University, Belfast |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, students can obtain undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in conservation science at the [[University of Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unifi.it/p-cor2-2016-101227-B194-GEN-1-1.html|title=Offerta formativa - Università degli Studi di Firenze - UniFI|website=www.unifi.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corsi.unibo.it/SCIENCEFORCONSERVATION/Pages/default.aspx|title=Two year master in Science for the conservation-restoration of cultural heritage - Ravenna - Università di Bologna|website=corsi.unibo.it|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recently created programme at the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice|University of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unive.it/pag/20740/|title=Summary: Master's Degree Programme in Conservation Science and Technology for Cultural Heritage - Ca' Foscari|website=www.unive.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other universities in Italy have faculty members whose primary research focus is in heritage science; these groups often accept international students who would like to obtain a PhD in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scich.it/index.html|title=COLOMBINI GROUP - Chemical Science for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage|website=www.scich.it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?oscar.chiantore#profilo|title=Prof. Oscar Chiantore - Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Scienza dei Materiali - Università degli Studi di Torino|last=Torino|first=Università degli Studi di|website=scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught courses in heritage science programmes include elements of heritage science, e.g. technical art history is often part of [[art history]] courses, and [[natural sciences]] are often taught in conservation courses. [[Brandenburg University of Technology]] in Germany offers the international Master's programme World Heritage Studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/en/heritage-studies-phd/|title=World Heritage Studies, Master of Arts|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PhD programme Heritage Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/worldheritage-ma/|title=PhD Programme Heritage Studies|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[University College London|UCL]], [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Brighton]], the Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology ([http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ SEAHA]) was established in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ |title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key aspect of the SEAHA scheme is the collaborative nature of projects, enabling partnerships between academic institutions, industry and national heritage agencies and giving an applied focus to the research training.

Since the field requires significant cross-disciplinary and transferrable skills, graduates may be able to take jobs in industry and academia. To work within the field of heritage science (e.g. in a museum laboratory), a PhD in the physical sciences and significant experience in a museum or conservation studio is typically required.

'''Historical ecology''' is a research program that focuses on the interactions between [[human]]s and their environment over long-term periods of time, typically over the course of centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Crumley, C. L. (1987). Historical ecology. In ''Regional dynamics: Burgundian landscapes in historical perspective'', eds. C. L. Crumley, W. H. Marquardt, pp. 237-264. New York:Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Scholl, Michael D., D. Seth Murray and Carole L. Crumley
2010 Comparing trajectories of climate, class and production: an historical ecology of American yeoman. In ''Environmental Social Sciences: Methods and Research Design''. pp. 322-348. Ismael Vaccaro, Eric Alden Smith, and Shankar Aswani, editors, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.
&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to ''and'' shape the environment, continuously contributing to [[landscape]] transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.&lt;ref name="Balee1"&gt;Balée, W. (1998). "Historical ecology: Premises and postulates". In W. Balée (Ed.), Advances in Historical Ecology, (pp 13-29). Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piecing together landscapes requires a sometimes difficult union between [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, close attention to geographic and temporal scales, a knowledge of the range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings in a way that is useful to researchers in many fields.&lt;ref&gt;Crumley, Carole L.

1994. Historical Ecology:a Multidimensional Ecological Orientation. In Historical Ecology: Cultural Knowledge and Changing Landscapes, ed. C.L. Crumley, pp. 1-16. Santa Fe: School  of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from [[geography]], [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and other disciplines. Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, [[ethnography|ethnographic interviews]], and landscape reconstructions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==History==
The discipline has several sites of origins by researchers who shared a common interest in the problem of ecology and history, but with a diversity of approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.]] used the term in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1964 | title = General and historical ecology | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 14 | issue = 7| pages = 33–35 | doi=10.2307/1293234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to describe a methodology that had been in long development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1944 | title = Analysis and Mexican archaeology: an attempt to apply the method | url = | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 135–149 | doi=10.2307/275110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deevey wished to bring together the practices of "general ecology" which was studied in an experimental laboratory, with a "historical ecology" which relied on  evidence collected through fieldwork. For example, Deevey used [[radiocarbon dating]] to reconcile biologists’ successions of plants and animals with the sequences of [[material culture]] and sites discovered by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1969 | title = Coaxing history to conduct experiments | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 40–43 | doi=10.2307/1294629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, members of the history department at the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]] organized a lecture series entitled "Historical Ecology: Essays on Environment and Social Change"&lt;ref&gt;Bilsky, L. J., ed. (1980) ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''. Port Washington, NY: Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors noted the public’s concerns with pollution and dwindling natural resources, and they began a dialogue between researchers with specialties which spanned the social sciences. The papers highlighted the importance of understanding social and political structures,  personal identities, perceptions of nature, and the multiplicity of solutions for environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;Moneyhon, C. H. (1980). Introduction. In ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''.ed. L. J. Bilsky, pp. 3-8. Port Washington, NY, Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of historical ecology as a coherent discipline was driven by a number of long-term research projects in historical ecology of tropical, temperate and arctic environments:

E.S. Deevey's Historical Ecology of the Maya Project (1973-1984) was carried out by archaeologists and biologists who combined data from lake sediments, settlement patterns, and material from excavations in the central [[Petén District]] of [[Guatemala]] to refute the hypotheses that a collapse of Mayan urban areas was instigated by faltering food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rice | first1 = D. | last2 = Rice | first2 = P. | year = 1984 | title = Lessons from the Maya | url = | journal = Latin American Research Review | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 7–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carole L. Crumley's Burgundian Landscape Project (1974–present) is carried out by a multidisciplinary research team aimed at identifying the multiple factors which have contributed to the long-term durability of the agricultural economy of [[Burgundy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;Carole L. Crumley, W. H. Marquardt (1987) ''Regional Dynamics: Burgundian Landscapes in Historical Perspective''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas H. McGovern's Inuit-Norse Project (1976–present) uses archaeology, environmental reconstruction, and textual analysis to examine the changing ecology of Nordic colonizers and indigenous peoples in [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faeroes]], and [[Shetland]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, T. 1981. The economics of extinction in Norse Greenland. In ''Climate and history: studies in past climates and their impact on man'', eds. T.M. L. Wrigley, M.J. Ingram, and G.Farmer, pp. 404-433. Cambridge: Cambridge  University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the approaches to historical ecology have been expanded to include coastal and marine environments:

Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Project (1984–present) examines [[Massachusetts]], USA cod fishing in the 17th through 19th centuries through historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Bolster | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Alexander | first3 = K.E. | last4 = Leavenworth | first4 = W.B. | last5 = Cooper | first5 = A.B. | last6 = McKenzie | first6 = M.G. | year = 2005 | title = The history of ocean resources: modeling cod biomass using historical records | doi = 10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0078:thoorm]2.0.co;2 | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 84–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida Keys Coral Reef Eco-region Project (1990–present) researchers at the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]] are examining archival records including natural history descriptions, maps and charts, family and personal papers, and state and colonial records in order to understand the impact of over-fishing and habitat loss in the [[Florida Keys]], USA which contains the third largest coral reef in the world.

Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Historical Ecology (2008–present) seeks to collect relevant historical data on fishing, whaling, and trade of the furs of aquatic animals in order form a baseline for environmental restorations of the [[California]], USA coast.&lt;ref&gt;Selbie, Hugo (2008) Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Historical Ecology Phase 1: Historical Sources Survey Report.

==Relations with other disciplines==

[[File:Idaho Falls Idaho Temple 2.jpeg|thumb|Manmade nature: In [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]], these waterfalls replaced naturally occurring ones]]
Historical ecology is interdisciplinary in principle; at the same time, it borrows heavily from the rich intellectual history of [[environmental anthropology]]. Western scholars have known since the time of [[Plato]] that the history of environmental changes cannot be separated from human history. Several ideas have been used to describe human interaction with the environment, the first of which is the concept of the [[Great Chain of Being]], or inherent design in nature. In this, all forms of life are ordered, with Humanity as the highest being, due to its knowledge and ability to modify nature. This lends to the concept of another nature, a manmade nature, which involves design or modification by humans, as opposed to design inherent in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, C. (1956). Changing ideas of the habitable world. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's role in changing the phase of the Earth (pp 73). Chicago: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in environmental transformation continued to increase in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting in a series of new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was [[environmental determinism]], developed by geographer [[Friedrich Ratzel]]. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of [[Franz Boas]] which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. [[Julian Steward]]'s [[cultural ecology]] is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.

Anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]] introduced the field of ecological anthropology in a deliberate attempt to move away from cultural ecology. Studies in ecological anthropology borrow heavily from the natural sciences, in particular, the concept of the ecosystem from [[systems ecology]]. In this approach, also called systems theory, ecosystems are seen as self-regulating, and as returning to a state of equilibrium. This theory views human populations as static and as acting in harmony with the environment.&lt;ref name="balee2"&gt;Balée, W. (2006). "The research program of historical ecology". Annual Review of Anthropology. Vol. 35, pp5.1-5.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revisions of anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] and others are especially pertinent to the development of historical ecology. These revisions and related critiques of environmental anthropology undertook to take into account the temporal and spatial dimensions of history and cultures, rather than continuing to view populations as static. These critiques led to the development of historical ecology by revealing the need to consider the historical, cultural, and evolutionary nature of landscapes and societies. Thus, historical ecology as a research program developed to allow for the examination of all types of societies, simple or complex, and their interactions with the environment over [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]].

==Landscapes in historical ecology==

In historical ecology, the [[landscape]] is defined as an area of interaction between human culture and the non-human environment.  The landscape is a perpetually changing, physical manifestation of history.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. G. (2000). Landscape, ecology and ecosystems management. Retrieved March 15, 2008, from Cooperative Extension Service, University of Kentucky Web site: http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/for/for76/for76.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology revises the notion of the [[ecosystem]] and replaces it with the landscape. While an ecosystem is static and cyclic, a landscape is historical. While the ecosystem concept views the environment as always trying to return to a state of equilibrium, the landscape concept considers "landscape transformation" to be a process of evolution. Landscapes do not return to a state of equilibrium, but are palimpsests of successive disturbances over time.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; The use of "landscape" instead of "ecosystem" as the core unit of analysis lies at the heart of historical ecology.

[[File:Carl O. Sauer.jpg|thumb|left|Geographer Carl O. Sauer]]
Various individuals and schools of thought have informed the idea of the landscape as historical ecologists conceive of it. The Old English words ''landskift'', ''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'' refer to environments that have been altered by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Calder, W.'', 1981 Beyond the View - our changing landscapes''. Inkata Press, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J.B., 1986, "The vernacular landscape", in Penning-Rowsell, E.C. &amp; D. Lowenthal, ''Landscape Meanings and Values'', Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = P.E. | year = 1934 | title = The terminology of regional description | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 78–79 | doi=10.1080/00045603409357125}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this etymology demonstrates, landscapes have been conceived of as related to human culture since at least the 5th century CE. Cultural and historical geographers have had a more recent influence. They adopted this idea from nineteenth-century German architects, gardeners, and landscape painters in Europe, Australia, and North America.&lt;ref name=Olwig&gt;Olwig, K (2002). ''Landscape, nature, and the body politic''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes are not only physical objects, but also "forms of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Carol. 1991. ''On Site: Architectural Preoccupations.'' Princeton: Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes have cultural meanings, for example, the sacredness in many cultures of burial grounds. This recognition of landscapes as forms of knowledge is central to historical ecology, which studies landscapes from an anthropocentric perspective.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

The idea of the cultural landscape is directly attributed to American geographer [[Carl Sauer]]. Sauer's theories developed as a critique of environmental determinism, which was a popular theory in the early twentieth century. Sauer's pioneering 1925 paper "The Morphology of Landscape" is now fundamental to many disciplines and defines the domain. In this, the term landscape is used in a geographical sense to mean an arbitrarily selected section of reality; morphology means the conceptual and methodological processes for altering it. Hence to Sauer, wherever humans lived and impacted the environment, landscapes with determinate histories resulted.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenzer | first1 = M. S. | year = 1985 | title = Milieu and the 'intellectual landscape': Carl O. Sauer's undergraduate heritage | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 258–270 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1985.tb00085.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as [[landscape ecology]]. Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize that this is not always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = M. G. | year = 2005 | title = Landscape ecology in North America: Past, present and future | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 86 | issue = 8| pages = 1967–1974 | doi=10.1890/04-0890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances as an integral part of the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as [[palimpsest]]s, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.

Historical ecologists recognize that landscapes undergo continuous alteration over time and these modifications are part of that landscape's history. Historical ecology recognizes that there is a primary and a secondary succession that occurs in the landscape. These successions should be understood without a preconceived bias against humanity. Landscape transformations are ecological successions driven by human impacts.  Primary landscape transformations occur when human activity results in a complete turnover of species and major [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] modifications in certain habitats while secondary landscape transformations involve human-induced changes in species proportions. The stages of landscape transformation demonstrate the history of a landscape. These stages can be brought on by humans or natural causes.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Parts of the Amazon rainforest exhibit different stages of landscape transformation such as the impact of indigenous [[slash-and-burn]] horticulture on plant species compositions. Such landscape transformation does not inherently reduce biodiversity or harm the environment. There are many cases in which human-mediated disturbance increases biodiversity as landscapes transform over time.

Historical ecology challenges the very notion of a pristine landscape, such as virgin rainforests.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; The idea that the landscape of the New World was uninhabited and unchanged by those groups that did inhabit it was fundamental to the justifications of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Denevan | first1 = William | year = 1992 | title = The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492 | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 369–385 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01965.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, perceptions of landscape have profound consequences on the histories of societies and their interactions with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Sluyter, Andrew (2002) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Colonialism_and_landscape.html?id=XA6R9UG2WxQC ''Colonialism and Landscape: Postcolonial Theory and Applications'']. New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; All landscapes have been altered by various organisms and mechanisms prior to human existence on Earth. Humans have always transformed the landscapes they inhabit, however, and today there are no landscapes on Earth that have not been affected by humans in some way.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

Human alterations have occurred in different phases, including the period prior to [[industrialization]]. These changes have been studied through the archeological record of modern humans and their history. The evidence that classless societies, like [[foragers]] and trekkers, were able to change a landscape was a breakthrough in historical ecology and anthropology as a whole.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Using an approach that combines history, ecology, and anthropology, a landscape's history can be observed and deduced through the traces of the various mechanisms that have altered it, anthropogenic or otherwise. Understanding the unique nature of every landscape, in addition to relations among landscapes, and the forms which comprise the landscape, is key to understanding historical ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. 1969 (1925). "The morphology of landscape." In J. Leighly (Ed.), ''Land and Life'' (pp 312-343). Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human-mediated disturbance==

[[File:Dalbek P1210001.JPG|thumb|Man-made irrigation canal]]
''Homo sapiens'' have interacted with the environment throughout history, generating a long-lasting influence on landscapes worldwide. Humans sometimes actively change their landscapes, while at other times their actions alter landscapes through secondary effects. These changes are called human-mediated disturbances, and are effected through various mechanisms. These mechanisms vary; they may be detrimental in some cases, but advantageous in others.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

Both destructive and at times constructive, [[anthropogenic fire]] is the most immediately visible human-mediated disturbance, and without it, many landscapes would become denatured.&lt;ref&gt;Pyne, S. J. (1998). "Forged in fire: History, land, and anthropogenic fire". In W. Balée (Ed.), ''Advances in Historical Ecology'', (pp 64-103). Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have practiced [[controlled burn]]s of forests globally for thousands of years, shaping landscapes in order to better fit their needs. They burned vegetation and forests to create space for crops, sometimes resulting in higher levels of species diversity. Today, in the absence of indigenous populations who once practiced controlled burns (most notably in [[North America]] and [[Australia]]), naturally ignited wildfires have increased. In addition, there has been destabilization of "ecosystem after ecosystem, and there is good documentation to suggest fire exclusion by Europeans has led to floral and faunal extinctions."&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

[[Invasive species|Biological invasions]] and the spread of [[pathogen]]s and [[disease]]s are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already existing environment. They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In some cases a new species may wreak havoc on a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a positive role. The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion.

Other mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances include [[water management]] and [[soil management]]. In [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] Europe, these have been recognized as ways of landscape alteration since the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Cicero]] noted that through fertilization, irrigation, and other activities, humans had essentially created a second world.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; At present, [[fertilization]] yields larger, more productive harvests of crops, but also has had adverse effects on many landscapes, such as decreasing the diversity of plant species and adding pollutants to soils.

===Anthropogenic fire===

Anthropogenic fire is a mechanism of human-mediated disturbance, defined within historical ecology as a means of altering the landscape in a way that better suits human needs.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt; The most common form of anthropogenic fire is controlled burns, or broadcast burning, which people have employed for thousands of years.  Forest fires and burning tend to carry negative connotations, yet controlled burns can have a favorable impact on landscape diversity, formation, and protection.

Broadcast burning alters the biota of a landscape. The immediate effect of a forest fire is a decrease in diversity. This negative impact associated with broadcast burning, however, is only temporary. Cycles of burning will allow the landscape to gradually increase in diversity. The time required for this change is dependent on the intensity, frequency, timing, and size of the controlled burns. After a few cycles, however, diversity increases. The adaptation to fire has shaped many of Earth's landscapes.

[[File:SwiddenFire6.jpg|thumb|A swidden fire, an example of a controlled burn]]
In addition to fostering diversity, controlled burns have helped change landscapes. These changes can range from grasslands to woodlands, from prairies or forest-steppes, to scrubland to forest. Whatever the case, these transformations increase diversity and engender landscapes more suitable to human needs, creating patches rich in utilitarian and natural resources.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt;

In addition to increasing diversity of landscapes, broadcast burning can militate against catastrophic wildfires. Forest fires gained a negative connotation because of cultural references to uncontrolled fires that take lives and destroy homes and properties. Controlled burns can decrease the risk of wildfires through the regular burning of undergrowth that would otherwise fuel rampant burning. Broadcast burning has helped to fireproof landscapes by burning off undergrowth and using up potential fuel, leaving little or no chance for a wildfire to be sparked by lightning.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt;

Of all of the mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances, anthropogenic fire has become one of great interest to ecologists, geographers, soil scientists, and anthropologists alike. By studying the effects of anthropogenic fires, anthropologists have been able to identify landscape uses and requirements of past cultures. Ecologists became interested in the study of anthropogenic fire as to utilize methods from previous cultures to develop policies for regular burning. Geographers and soil scientists are interested in the utility of anthropic soils caused by burning in the past. The interest in anthropogenic fire came about in the wake of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This time period included a mass migration from rural to urban areas, which decreased controlled burning in the countryside. This led to an increase in the frequency and strength of wildfires, thus initiating a need to develop proper prevention methods.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt; Historical ecology focuses on the impact on landscapes through human-mediated disturbances, once such being anthropogenic fire. It is a fusion of ecological, geographical, anthropological, and pedological interests.

===Biological invasions===
[[File:Lymantria dispar MHNT Chenille.jpg|thumb|''Lymantria dispar'']]
Biological invasions are composed of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species can eliminate or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct competitive exclusion. Invasive species typically spread at a faster rate when they have no natural predators or when they fill an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions.

Invasive species can be transported intentionally or accidentally. Many invasive species originate in shipping areas from where they are unintentionally transported to their new location. Sometimes human populations intentionally introduce species into new landscapes to serve various purposes, ranging from decoration to erosion control. These species can later become invasive and dramatically modify the landscape. It is important to note that not all exotic species are invasive; in fact, the majority of newly introduced species never become invasive.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; Humans have on their migrations through the ages taken along plants of agricultural and medicinal value, so that the modern distribution of such favored species is a clear mapping of the routes they have traveled and the places they have settled.

One example of an invasive species that has had a significant impact on the landscape is the [[gypsy moth]] (''Lymantria dispar''). The foliage-feeding gypsy moth is originally from temperate [[Eurasia]]; it was intentionally brought to the United States by an [[entomologist]] in 1869. Many specimens escaped from captivity and have since changed the ecology of deciduous and coniferous forests in North America by defoliation. This has led not only to the loss of wildlife habitat, but also other forest services, such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. After its initial introduction, the continued accidental transport of its larvae across North America has contributed to its population explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, P.C. and A.M. Liebhold. "Gypsy Moth." pp. 238-241 in: D. Simberloff and M. Rejmanek, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions'', University of California Press, Berkeley, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the medium of introduction, biological invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote about the benefits of biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define because there is no canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an enormous impact on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion.

===Epidemic disease===
[[File:San tribesman.jpg|thumb|A San Tribesman: Those living in dry climates have fewer intestinal parasites.]]
A clear relationship between nature and people is expressed through human disease. Infectious disease can thus be seen as another example of human-mediated disturbance as humans are [[Host (biology)|hosts]] for infectious diseases. Historically, evidence of epidemic diseases is associated with the beginnings of agriculture and sedentary communities. Previously, human populations were too small and mobile for most infections to become established as [[chronic diseases]]. Permanent settlements, due to agriculture, allowed for more inter-community interaction, enabling infections to develop as specifically human pathogens.&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"&gt;Newson, L.A. (1998) "A historical-ecological perspective on epidemic disease." In W. Balee (Ed.). ''Advances in historical ecology'' (pp 42-63). New York: Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of human disease have revealed a reciprocal relationship between humans and parasites. The variety of parasites found within the human body often reflects the diversity of the environment in which that individual resides. For instance, Bushmen and Australian [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] have half as many intestinal parasites as African and Malaysian hunter-gatherers living in a species-rich tropical rainforest. Infectious diseases can be either chronic or acute, and epidemic or endemic, impacting the population in any given community to different extents. Thus, human-mediated disturbance can either increase or decrease species diversity in a landscape, causing a corresponding change in [[pathogenic diversity]].&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"/&gt;

===Transformation of waterways===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Amazonia5.jpg |thumb|Satellite view of anthropogenic transformation of [[Amazon basin]] waterways near the city of Manaus, Brazil along the north bank of the Negro River, 11 miles (18 km) above its confluence with the Amazon]] --&gt;

Historical ecologists postulate that landscape transformations have occurred throughout history, even before the dawn of [[western culture|western civilization]]. Human-mediated disturbances are predated by soil [[erosion]] and animals damming waterways which contributed to waterway transformations. [[Landscape]]s, in turn, were altered by waterway transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. (1992). ''So shall you reap''. New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology views the effects of human-mediated disturbances on waterway transformation as both subtle and drastic occurrences. Waterways have been modified by humans through the building of irrigation canals, expanding or narrowing waterways, and multiple other adjustments done for [[agricultural]] or transportation usage.

The evidence for past and present agricultural use of [[wetlands]] in [[Mesoamerica]] suggests an evolutionary sequence of landscape and [[waterway]] alteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Surian | first1 = N. | last2 = Rinaldi | first2 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Morphological response to river engineering and management in alluvial channels in Italy | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 307–326 | doi=10.1016/s0169-555x(02)00219-2| bibcode = 2003Geomo..50..307S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pre-Columbian]], indigenous agriculturalists developed capabilities with which to raise crops under a wide range of ecological conditions, giving rise to a multiplicity of altered, cultivated landscapes. The effects of waterway transformation were particularly evident in Mesoamerica, where agricultural practices ranged from swiddening to multicropped hydraulically transformed wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, T. M. &amp; Turner, B. L. II. (1992). "Landscapes of a cultivation in Mesoamerica on the eve of the conquest." ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 82 (3), 402-425. {{jstor|2563353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manaus]], the largest city on the Amazon, as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the muddy Amazon River and the dark Rio Negro]]

Historical ecologists view the [[Amazon basin]] landscape as cultural and embodying social labor. The [[Amazon River]] has been altered by the local population for crop growth and water transportation. Previous research failed to account for human interaction with the Amazon landscape. Recent research, however, has demonstrated that the landscape has been manipulated by its [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] population over time. The continual, natural shifting of rivers, however, often masked the human disturbances in the course of rivers. As a result, the indigenous populations in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] are often overlooked for their ability to alter the land and the river.&lt;ref name=Raffles&gt;Raffles, H. The Amazon: a natural landscape?
http://www.india-seminar.com/2000/486/486%20raffles.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[waterway]] transformation has been successfully identified in the Amazon landscape. Clark Erickson observes that pre-Hispanic [[savanna]] peoples of the [[Bolivia]]n Amazon built an [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] landscape through the construction of raised fields, large settlement mounds, and earthen causeways. Erickson, on the basis of location, form, patterning, associations and ethnographic analogy, identified a particular form of earthwork, the zigzag structure, as fish [[weir]]s in the savanna of [[Baures]], Bolivia. The artificial zigzag structures were raised from the adjacent savanna and served as a means to harvest the fish who used them to migrate and spawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = C. L. | year = 2000 | title = An artificial landscape-scale fishery in the Bolivian Amazon | url = http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/%7Ecerickso/fishweir/articles/Nature1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | pages = 190–193 | bibcode = 2000Natur.408..190E | doi = 10.1038/35041555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence of waterway transformation is found in [[Igarapé]] [[Guariba]] in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin where people have intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British [[naturalists]] [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close to the town of Igarapé-Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarapé Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long across fields thick with tall [[papyrus]] grass and into dense tropical rain forest. The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape in this part of the northern Brazilian state of [[Amapá]] was dramatically transformed.&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

In general, with an increase in global population growth, comes an increase in the [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of waterways. The [[Sumer]]ians had created extensive irrigations by 4000 BC. As the population increased in the 3,000 years of agriculture, the ditches and canals increased in number. By the early 1900s, ditching, dredging, and diking had become common practice. This led to an increase in [[erosion]] which impacted the landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens, A. H. (1983, April). "Wetland agriculture in Pre-Hispanic [[Mesoamerica]]." ''Geographical Review'', 73 (2), 166-181 {{jstor|214642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activities have affected the natural role of rivers and its communal value. These changes in waterways have impacted the floodplains, natural tidal patterns, and the surrounding land.&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, B. &amp; Smith, T. (2007, October 15). "Reviving a river." Retrieved March 28, 2008, from Massachusetts Wetlands Restoration Program Web site: http://www.mass.gov/czm/coastlines/2006/ebbflow/river.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of understanding such transformation is it provides a more accurate understanding to long-standing popular and academic insights of the Amazon, as well as other [[ecological]] settings, as places where [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] populations have dealt with the forces of [[nature]]. Ecological landscapes have been portrayed as an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], not a [[society]]. Recent studies supported by historical ecologists, however, understand that ecological landscape like the Amazon are biocultural, rather than simply natural and provide for a greater understanding of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of both [[waterways]] and [[landscapes]].&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

===Soil management===

[[Soil management]], or direct human interaction with the soil, is another mechanism of anthropogenic change studied by historical ecologists. Soil management can take place through rearranging soils, altering drainage patterns, and building large earthen formations. Consistent with the basic premises of historical ecology, it is recognized that anthropogenic soil management practices can have both positive and negative effects on local [[biodiversity]]. Some agricultural practices have led to organically and chemically impoverished soils. In the North American Midwest, industrial agriculture has led to a loss in [[topsoil]]. Salinization of the [[Euphrates River]] has occurred due to ancient Mesopotamian irrigation, and detrimental amounts of zinc have been deposited in the New Caliber River of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Erickson&gt;Erickson, C. &amp; Balée, W. (2006). In time and complexity in historical ecology: Studies in the neotropical lowlands (pp 7-12). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, soil management practices may not have any effect on soil fertility. The iconic mounds of the Hopewell Indians built in the Ohio River valley likely served a religious or ceremonial purpose, and show little evidence of changing soil fertility in the landscape.

The case of soil management in the Neotropics (including the Amazon) is a classic example of beneficial results of human-mediated disturbance. In this area, prehistoric peoples altered the texture and chemical composition of natural soils. The altered black and brown earths, known as Amazon Dark Earths, or [[Terra preta]], are actually much more fertile than unaltered surrounding soils.&lt;ref name=Erickson/&gt; Furthermore, the increased soil fertility improves the results of agriculture. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of [[charcoal]] in high concentrations, along with pottery shards and organic residues from plants, animal bones, and feces. It is also shows increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and manganese; along with high levels of microorganic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Terra preta web site. School of geosciences and geography (Universität Bayreuth). Retrieved on April 5, 2008, from {{cite web |url=http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025170240/http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |archivedate=2005-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now accepted that these soils are a product of a labor-intensive technique termed [[slash-and-char]]. In contrast to the commonly known [[slash-and-burn]] technique, this uses a lower temperature burn that produces more charcoal than ashes. Research shows these soils were created by human activity between 9000 and 2500 years ago. Contemporary local farmers actively seek out and sell this dark earth, which covers around 10% of the Amazon basin. Harvesting Terra preta does not deplete it however, for it has the ability to regenerate at the rate of one centimeter per year by sequestering more carbon.&lt;ref name=sington&gt;Sington, D. (Director) (2002). Horizon: The secret of El Dorado [Videotape]. BBC Horizon Series. London: Dox Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DirkvdM santa fe scorched.jpg|thumb|Scorched land resulting from slash-and-burn agriculture]]
Interest in and the study of Amazon dark earths was advanced with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and it reminded him of the soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. Woods has made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marris | first1 = E. | year = 2006 | title = Putting the Carbon back: Black is the new green | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = | pages = 624–626 | doi=10.1038/442624a | pmid=16900176| bibcode = 2006Natur.442..624M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, forests are well known for having greater biodiversity than nearby savannas or grasslands. Thus, the creation of ‘forest islands’ in multiple locations can be considered a positive result of human activity. This is evident in the otherwise uniform savannas of Guinea and central Brazil that are punctured by scattered clumps of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Fairhead, J. &amp; Leach, M. (1996). ''Misreading the African landscape: Society and ecology in a forest-savanna mosaic.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These clumps are the result of generations of intense resource management. Earth works and mounds formed by humans, such as the Ibibate mound complex in the Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia, are examples of built environments that have undergone landscape transformation and provide habitats for a greater number of species than the surrounding wetland areas.&lt;ref name=sington/&gt;  The forest islands in the Bolivian Amazon not only increase the local plant species diversity, but also enhance subsistence possibilities for the local people.

==Applied historical ecology==

Historical ecology involves an understanding of multiple fields of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, and the impact of human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines.   Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid land managers by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned how to effectively alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = German | first1 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = Historical contingencies in the coevolution of environment and livelihood: contributions to the debate on Amazon Black Earth | url = http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/875/14Exemplary(A).pdf | format = PDF | journal = Geoderma | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 307–331 | doi=10.1016/s0016-7061(02)00270-7 | bibcode=2003Geode.111..307G}}&lt;/ref&gt; much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them.

Historical ecology can also aid in the goals of other fields of study. [[Conservation biology]] recognizes different types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. [[Restoration ecology]] restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a degraded ecosystem back toward a higher value or use, but not necessarily to its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. Revegetation involves new additions of biota into a landscape, not limited to the original inhabitants of an area.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.L., Gibbs, J.P. (2006) ''Fundamentals of Conservation Biology''. 3rd ed. (pp 252-276). Malden, Massachusetts, Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-3545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and revegetation can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape.

A tropical forest in particular needs to be studied extensively because it is a highly diverse, heterogeneous setting. Historical ecology can use archaeological sites within this setting to study past successes and failures of indigenous peoples.  The use of swidden fires in Laos is an example of historical ecology as used by current land managers in policy-making. Swidden fires were originally considered a source of habitat degradation. This conclusion led the Laos government to discourage farmers from using swidden fires as a farming technique. However, recent research has found that swidden fires were practiced historically in Laos and were not, in fact, the source of degradation. Similar research revealed that habitat degradation originated from a population increase after the Vietnam War. The greater volume of people compelled the government to put pressure on farmers for increased agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robichaud | first1 = W. G. | last2 = Sinclair | first2 = A. R.E. | last3 = Odarkor-Lanquaye | first3 = N. | last4 = Klinkenberg | first4 = B. | year = 2009 | title = Stable Forest Cover Under Increasing Populations of Swidden Cultivators in Central Laos: the Roles of Intrinsic Culture and Extrinsic Wildlife Trade | url = http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss1/art33/ | journal = Ecology and Society | volume = 14 | issue = 1| page = 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land managers no longer automatically eliminate the use of swidden fires, but rather the number of swidden fires that are set for government-sponsored agricultural purposes.

The San Francisco Estuary Institute also uses historical ecology to study human impacts on the California landscape to guide environmental management.&lt;ref&gt;Grossinger, R.M., Striplen, C.J., Brewster, E., Beller, E.E., Askevold, R. 2007. "Historical landscape ecology of an urbanized California valley: wetlands and woodlands in the Santa Clara Valley." ''Landscape Ecology''. :103-120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = A. | last2 = Grossinger | first2 = R.M. | last3 = Davis | first3 = F.W. | year = 2011 | title = Shifting Baselines in a California Oak Savanna: Nineteenth Century Data to Inform Restoration Scenarios | url = | journal = Restoration Ecology | volume = 19 | issue = 101| pages = 88–101 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00633.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the wetlands of Elkhorn Slough near [[Monterey, California]], sought to enhance conservation and restoration activities. By using historical data such as maps, charts, and aerial photographs, researchers were able to trace habitat change to built structures that had negatively altered the tidal flow into the estuaries dating from the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyke | first1 = E.V. | last2 = Wasson | first2 = K. | year = 2005 | title = Historical Ecology of a Central California Estuary: 150 Years of Habitat Change | url = http://www.elkhornslough.org | journal = Estuaries | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 173–189 | doi=10.1007/bf02732853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study further suggested using techniques that "imitate the complex structure of natural tidal wetlands and maintain connectivity with intact wetland habitats as well as with adjoining subtidal and upland habitats."

==Fields==

===Anthropology===
{{Main|Anthropology}}

[[Anthropology]] is the holistic "science of humans", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the [[social sciences]], humanities and [[human biology]]. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The natural ''sciences'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''humanities'' generally study local traditions, through their [[history]], [[literature]], [[music]], and [[art]]s, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.

The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. | title = Anthropology, Sociology, and Other Dubious Disciplines | doi = 10.1086/375868 | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–465 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: [[archaeology]], physical or [[biological anthropology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word ''anthropos'' (άνθρωπος) is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "human being" or "person". [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences".

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York: |publisher=J. P. Putnam's Sons}} Originally published 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropologists use terms such as "less complex" societies, or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as "pastoralist" or "forager" or "horticulturalist", to discuss humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology.

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms. ''Culture Counts''. Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
{{Main|Archaeology}}

Archaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of [[material culture]]. The [[archaeological record]] consists of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[architecture]], [[biofact (archaeology)|biofacts]] or ecofacts, and [[cultural landscapes]]. Archaeology can be considered both a [[social science]] and a branch of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.42.8 | issue=42 | title=The Intellectual Base of Archaeological Research 2004-2013: a visualisation and analysis of its disciplinary links, networks of authors and conceptual language | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Sinclair | first1 = Anthony }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has various goals, which range from understanding [[culture history]] to reconstructing past [[lifeway]]s to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time.

Archaeology is thought of as a branch of [[anthropology]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |first1=William A. |last= Haviland |first2= Harald E. L. |last2= Prins |first3=Bunny |last3=McBride |first4=Dana |last4=Walrath |publisher=Cengage Learning |year= 2010 |edition=13th |isbn=0-495-81082-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as [[history]].

===Classics===
[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], the most famous Greek poet]]
[[Classics]], in the [[Western culture|Western]] academic tradition, refers to the studies of the cultures of [[classical antiquity]], namely Ancient Greek and Latin and the Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures. Classical studies is considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities; however, its popularity declined during the 20th century. Nevertheless, the influence of classical ideas on many humanities disciplines, such as philosophy and literature, remains strong.

===History===
[[History]] is systematically collected [[information]] about the [[past]]. When used as the name of a [[field of study]], ''history'' refers to the study and interpretation of the record of [[human]]s, [[society|societies]], institutions, and any topic that has changed over time.

Traditionally, the study of history has been considered a part of the humanities. In modern [[academia]], history is occasionally classified as a [[social science]].

===Linguistics and languages===
{{Main|Linguistics|Language}}
{{see also2|{{in title|language}}}}
While the scientific study of language is known as [[linguistics]] and is generally considered a [[social science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |title=Social Science Majors, University of Saskatchewan |access-date=2016-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906113657/http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |archive-date=2015-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[natural science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|title=Language as a Natural Object; Linguistics as a Natural Science|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723173105/http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|archive-date=2010-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as [[Wittgenstein]] claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including [[prose]] forms (such as the [[novel]]), [[poetry]] and [[drama]], also lies at the heart of the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a [[foreign language]] usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.

===Law and politics===
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]]]]{{Main|Law}} In common parlance, [[law]] means a rule that (unlike a rule of ethics) is enforceable through institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crimes Against Humanity|first=Geoffrey| last=Robertson| authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|year=2006| publisher=Penguin|page=90| isbn=978-0-14-102463-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a "system of rules",&lt;ref name="hhc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=H. L. A. |authorlink=H. L. A. Hart |title=The Concept of Law |year=1961 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-876122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an "interpretive concept"&lt;ref name="rdl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dworkin |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Dworkin |title=Law's Empire |year=1986 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-51836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve justice, as an "authority"&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raz |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Raz |title=The Authority of Law |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-956268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mediate people's interests, and even as "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin |first=John |authorlink=John Austin (legal philosopher) |title=The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined |year=1831 |publisher= |location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every [[social science]] and discipline of the humanities. Laws are [[politic]]s, because politicians create them. Law is [[philosophy]], because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of [[history]]'s stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on how productivity is organised and the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the Latin word ''LEX''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{main|Literature}}
[[File:First Folio.jpg|thumb|[[Shakespeare]] wrote some of the most acclaimed works in [[English literature]].]] '''Literature''' is a term that does not have a universally accepted definition, but which has variably included all written work; writing that possesses literary merit; and language that foregrounds literariness, as opposed to [[ordinary language]]. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] the term derives from [[Latin]] ''literatura/litteratura'' "writing formed with letters", although some definitions include [[Oral literature|spoken or sung texts]]. Literature can be classified according to whether it is [[fiction]] or [[non-fiction]], and whether it is [[poetry]] or [[prose]]; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the [[novel]], [[short story]] or [[drama]]; and works are often categorised according to historical periods, or according to their adherence to certain [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] features or expectations ([[genre]]).

===Philosophy===
[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|The works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] overlap into many fields of the humanities, such as philosophy, literature, theology, music, and classical studies.]]
Philosophy—etymologically, the "love of wisdom"—is generally the study of problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right and wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these issues by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument, rather than experiments ([[experimental philosophy]] being an exception).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nagel (1987). ''What Does It All Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy''. Oxford University Press, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy used to be a very comprehensive term, including what have subsequently become separate disciplines, such as [[physics]]. (As [[Immanuel Kant]] noted, "Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three sciences: physics, ethics, and logic.")&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1785). ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'', the first line.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the main fields of philosophy are [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and [[epistemology]]. Still, it continues to overlap with other disciplines. The field of [[semantics]], for example, brings philosophy into contact with [[linguistics]].

Since the early twentieth century, philosophy in English-speaking [[universities]] has moved away from the humanities and closer to the formal sciences, becoming much more ''analytic.'' [[Analytic philosophy]] is marked by emphasis on the use of logic and formal methods of reasoning, conceptual analysis, and the use of [[symbolic logic|symbolic]] and/or [[mathematical logic]], as contrasted with the [[Continental philosophy|Continental style of philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Brian Leiter [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp] "'Analytic' philosophy today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics than with the humanities."&lt;/ref&gt; This method of inquiry is largely indebted to the work of philosophers such as [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G.E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

===Religion===
[[File:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|The [[compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|creation]].]]
New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly around the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]] in [[India]], [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] being some of the earliest major faiths. In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain predominance, looked not to the force of law, but to the power and example of tradition for political morality. In the west, the Greek philosophical tradition, represented by the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout Europe and the Middle East by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander of Macedon]] in the 4th century BC.

[[Abrahamic religions]] are those [[religion]]s deriving from a common ancient tradition and traced by their adherents to [[Abraham]] (circa 1900 BCE), a [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] whose life is narrated in the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]], where he is described as a [[prophet]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:7), and in the [[Quran]], where he also appears as a [[prophets of Islam|prophet]]. This forms a large group of related largely monotheistic religions, generally held to include [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], and comprises over half of the world's religious adherents.

===Performing arts===
The [[performing art]]s differ from the [[visual arts]] in so far as the former uses the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium, and the latter uses materials such as clay, metal, or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create some [[work of art|art object]]. Performing arts include [[acrobatics]], [[busking]], [[comedy]], [[dance]], [[film]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[music]], [[opera]], [[juggling]], [[marching arts]], such as [[brass band]]s, and [[theatre]].

Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]], such as with [[costume]]s and [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], etc. There is also a specialized form of [[fine art]] in which the artists ''perform'' their work live to an audience. This is called [[Performance art]]. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of [[Theatrical property|props]]. Dance was often referred to as a ''plastic art'' during the [[Modern dance]] era.

====Musicology====
[[File:Mozarteum grosser saal buehne mit orchester.jpg|thumb|Concert in the Mozarteum, Salzburg]]
[[Musicology]] as an academic discipline can take a number of different paths, including [[historical musicology]], [[ethnomusicology]] and [[music theory]]. Undergraduate music majors generally take courses in all of these areas, while graduate students focus on a particular path. In the liberal arts tradition, musicology is also used to broaden skills of non-musicians by teaching skills such as concentration and listening.

====Theatre====
[[Theatre]] (or theater) (Greek "theatron", ''θέατρον'') is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]], [[mummers' play]]s, and [[pantomime]].

====Dance====
Dance (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', perhaps from [[Old Frankish language|Frankish]]) generally refers to [[human]] [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]] or presented in a [[Social environment|social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[Waggle dance|bee dance]], mating dance), and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (''the [[leaves]] danced in the [[wind]]''). [[Choreography]] is the art of creating dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.

Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]], and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]].
===Visual arts===

====History of visual arts====
[[File:Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain.jpg|thumbnail|''Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain'' by [[Emperor Gaozong of Song China|Emperor Gaozong]] (1107–1187) of [[Song Dynasty]]; fan mounted as album leaf on silk, four columns in cursive script.]]
The great traditions in [[art]] have a foundation in the art of one of the ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Japan]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[China]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|India]], [[Greater Nepal]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Mesoamerica]].

Ancient Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g., [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt).

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. The [[Renaissance]] saw the return to valuation of the material world, and this shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of landscape.

Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan.

Religious [[Islam]]ic art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead. The physical and rational certainties depicted by the 19th-century Enlightenment were shattered not only by new discoveries of relativity by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but also by unprecedented technological development. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art.

====Media types====

=====Drawing=====
[[Drawing]] is a means of making a [[image|picture]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in [[technical drawing]] is referred to as a ''draftsman'' or ''draughtsman''.

=====Painting=====
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Mona Lisa]]'', by Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most recognizable artistic paintings in the [[Western world]].]]
[[Painting]] taken literally is the practice of applying [[pigment]] suspended in a carrier (or [[Paint#Components|medium]]) and a binding agent (a [[adhesive|glue]]) to a surface (support) such as [[paper]], [[canvas]] or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with [[drawing]], [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to [[Sistine Chapel|The Sistine Chapel]] to the human body itself.

Colour is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but elsewhere white may be. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including [[Goethe]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Isaac Newton]], have written their own [[colour theory|colour theories]]. Moreover, the use of language is only a generalization for a colour equivalent. The word "[[red]]", for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum. There is not a formalized register of different colours in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as [[musical notation|C]] or [[musical notation|C#]] in music, although the [[Pantone]] system is widely used in the printing and design industry for this purpose.

Modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. This began with [[cubism]] and is not painting in strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]] or [[wood]] for their [[Texture (painting)|texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]]. Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of [[concept]]; this has led some {{Who|date=June 2011}} to say that painting, as a serious art form, is dead, although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work.

==Origin of the term==
The word "humanities" is derived from the [[Renaissance Latin]] expression ''studia humanitatis'', or "study of ''[[humanitas]]''" (a classical Latin word meaning—in addition to "humanity"—"culture, refinement, education" and, specifically, an "education befitting a cultivated man"). In its usage in the early 15th century, the ''studia humanitatis'' was a course of studies that consisted of grammar, poetry, rhetoric, history, and moral philosophy, primarily derived from the study of Latin and Greek classics. The word ''humanitas'' also gave rise to the Renaissance Italian neologism ''umanisti'', whence "humanist", "[[Renaissance humanism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"humanism." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 11 Apr. 2012. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275932/humanism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the West, the study of the humanities can be traced to ancient Greece, as the basis of a broad education for citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Bod, Rens; ''A New History of the Humanities'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; During Roman times, the concept of the seven [[liberal arts]] evolved, involving [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] (the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]), along with [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astrology and astronomy|astronomy]] and [[music]] (the [[quadrivium]]).&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Albert W.; ''The Humanities Today'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; These subjects formed the bulk of [[medieval]] education, with the emphasis being on the humanities as skills or "ways of doing".

A major shift occurred with the [[Renaissance humanism]] of the fifteenth century, when the humanities began to be regarded as subjects to study rather than practice, with a corresponding shift away from traditional fields into areas such as literature and history. In the 20th century, this view was in turn challenged by the [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] movement, which sought to redefine the humanities in more [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] terms suitable for a [[democracy|democratic]] society since the Greek and Roman societies in which the humanities originated were not at all democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Walling, Donovan R.; ''Under Construction: The Role of the Arts and Humanities in Postmodern Schooling'' Phi Delta Kappa Educational Foundation, Bloomington, Indiana, 1997. Humanities comes from human&lt;/ref&gt; This was in keeping with the postmodernists' nuanced view of themselves as the culmination of history.

==Today==

=== Education and employment ===
For many decades, there has been a growing public perception that a humanities education inadequately prepares graduates for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hersh|first=Richard H.|date=1997-03-01|title=Intention and Perceptions A National Survey of Public Attitudes Toward Liberal Arts Education|journal=Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning|volume=29|issue=2|pages=16–23|doi=10.1080/00091389709603100|issn=0009-1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common belief is that graduates from such programs face underemployment and incomes too low for a humanities education to be worth the investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/27/hooray_for_worthless_education/|title=Hooray for "worthless" education!|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|website=Salon|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, humanities graduates find employment in a wide variety of management and professional occupations. In Britain, for example, over 11,000 humanities majors found employment in the following occupations:
* Education (25.8%)
* Management (19.8%)
* Media/Literature/Arts (11.4%)
* Law (11.3%)
* Finance (10.4%)
* Civil service (5.8%)
* Not-for-profit (5.2%)
* Marketing (2.3%)
* Medicine (1.7%)
* Other (6.4%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://torch.ox.ac.uk/sites/torch/files/publications/Humanities%20Graduates%20and%20the%20British%20Economy%20-%20University%20of%20Oxford.pdf|title=Humanities graduates and the British economy: The hidden impact|last=Kreager|first=Philip|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, usually within five years of graduation, humanities graduates find an occupation or career path that appeals to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koc|first=Edwin W|year=2010|title=The Liberal Arts Graduate College Hiring Market|url=https://canvas.wisc.edu/files/77515/download?download_frd=1&amp;verifier=yadEsAdLKIQpRNLKXPwePhZh1jVmeqF7AInh8qDc|journal=National Association of Colleges and Employers|volume=|pages=14–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2008/2008155.pdf|title=Ten Years After College: Comparing the Employment Experiences of 1992–93 Bachelor's Degree Recipients With Academic and Career Oriented Majors|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
{{Main|Humanities in the United States}}

====The Humanities Indicators====
The [[Humanities Indicators]], unveiled in 2009 by the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], are the first comprehensive compilation of data about the humanities in the United States, providing scholars, policymakers and the public with detailed information on humanities education from primary to higher education, the humanities workforce, humanities funding and research, and public humanities activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amacad.org/ |title=American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences |publisher=Amacad.org |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/ |title=Humanities Indicators |publisher=Humanities Indicators |date= |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeled after the National Science Board's Science and Engineering Indicators, the Humanities Indicators are a source of reliable benchmarks to guide analysis of the state of the humanities in the United States.

If "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charette |first=Robert N. |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth – IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2013-08-30 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; statements about a "crisis" in the humanities are also misleading and ignore data of the sort collected by the Humanities Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Humanities-Scholars-See/140311/ Humanities Scholars See Declining Prestige, Not a Lack of Interest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/A-Collection-of-Articles-and/140205/ Debating the State of the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Humanities in American Life''====
The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world where irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====As a major====

In 1950, a little over 1 percent of 22-year-olds in the United States had earned a humanities degrees (defined as a degree in English, language, history, philosophy); in 2010, this had doubled to about 2 and a half percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Ben|title=A Crisis in the Humanities? (10 June 2013)|url=http://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/06/10/the-humanities-crisis/|website=The Chronicle|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this is because there was an overall rise in the number of Americans who have any kind of college degree. (In 1940, 4.6 percent had a four-year degree; in 2016, 33.4 percent had one.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Reid|title=Census: More Americans have college degrees than ever before|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/326995-census-more-americans-have-college-degrees-than-ever-before|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=The Hill|date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a percentage of the type of degrees awarded, however, the humanities seem to be declining. Harvard University provides one example. In 1954, 36 percent of Harvard undergraduates majored in the humanities, but in 2012, only 20 percent took that course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuessler|first1=Jennifer|title=Humanities Committee Sounds an Alarm|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/arts/humanities-committee-sounds-an-alarm.html|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Benjamin Schmidt of Northeastern University has documented that between 1990 to 2008, degrees in English, history, foreign languages, and philosophy have decreased from 8 percent to just under 5 percent of all U.S. college degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-14/the-great-recession-never-ended-for-college-humanities|title=The Great Recession Never Ended for College Humanities|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=14 August 2018|website=Bloomberg|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In liberal arts education====
[[The Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences]] 2013 report ''The Heart of the Matter'' supports the notion of a broad "[[Liberal arts colleges|liberal arts education]]", which includes study in disciplines from the natural sciences to the arts as well as the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/18/humanities-social-sciences-column/2436093/ Humanities, social sciences critical to our future]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/428644/august-15-2013/richard-brodhead Colbert Report: The humanities do pay]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[colleges]] provide such an education; some require it. The [[University of Chicago]] and [[Columbia University]] were among the first schools to require an extensive [[core curriculum]] in philosophy, literature, and the arts for all students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Menand]], "The Problem of General Education," in ''The Marketplace of Ideas'' (W. W. Norton, 2010), especially pp. 32–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Other colleges with nationally recognized, mandatory programs in the liberal arts are [[Fordham University]], [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]]. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E. D. Hirsch, Jr.]].

====In the digital age====
Researchers in the humanities have developed numerous large- and small-scale digital corpora, such as digitized collections of historical texts, along with the digital tools and methods to analyze them. Their aim is both to uncover new knowledge about corpora and to visualize research data in new and revealing ways. Much of this activity occurs in a field called the [[digital humanities]].

====STEM====
Politicians in the United States currently espouse a need for increased funding of the [[STEM fields]], science, technology, engineering, mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/reform |title=Whitehouse.gov |access-date=2014-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021222654/http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/reform |archive-date=2014-10-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal funding represents a much smaller fraction of funding for humanities than other fields such as STEM or medicine.&lt;ref name="bi_26Jun2013"&gt;''America Is Raising A Generation Of Kids Who Can't Think Or Write Clearly'', [http://www.businessinsider.com/the-war-against-humanities-2013-6 Business Insider]&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a decline of quality in both college and pre-college education in the humanities field.&lt;ref name="bi_26Jun2013"/&gt;

Former four-term Louisiana Governor, [[Edwin Edwards]] (D), has recently acknowledged the importance of the humanities. In a video address&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUY5c9IrAHE YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; to the academic conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scedhs2014.uqam.ca/en/program.html Scedhs2014.uqam.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revolutions in Eighteenth-Century Sociability'', Edwards said
:Without the humanities to teach us how history has succeeded or failed in directing the fruits of technology and science to the betterment of our tribe of ''homo sapiens'', without the humanities to teach us how to frame the discussion and to properly debate the uses-and the costs-of technology, without the humanities to teach us how to safely debate how to create a more just society with our fellow man and woman, technology and science would eventually default to the  ownership of—and misuse by—the most influential, the most powerful, the most feared among us.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8919778/Introductory_remarks_by_former_four-term_Louisiana_Governor_Edwin_W._Edwards_Honorary_Chair_Montreal_Enlightenment_Conference_October_18_2014 Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The value of the humanities debate====

The contemporary debate in the field of critical university studies centers around the declining value of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Collini]], "What Are Universities For?"(Penguin 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Small]], "The Value of the Humanities"(Oxford University Press 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; As in America, there is a perceived decline in interest within higher education policy in research that is qualitative and does not produce marketable products. This threat can be seen in a variety of forms across Europe, but much critical attention has been given to the field of research assessment in particular. For example, the UK [Research Excellence Framework] has been subject to criticism due to its assessment criteria from across the humanities, and indeed, the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Palgrave Communications 3, Article number: 17020 (2017)
doi:10.1057/palcomms.2017.20&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the notion of "impact" has generated significant debate.&lt;ref&gt;The Social Impact of the Arts http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230572553&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulaitis|first=Zoe|year=2017|title=Measuring impact in the humanities: Learning from accountability and economics in a contemporary history of cultural value|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-017-0002-7|journal=Palgrave Communications|via=|doi=10.1057/s41599-017-0002-7|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical history==

===Citizenship and self-reflection===

Since the late 19th century, a central justification for the humanities has been that it aids and encourages self-reflection—a self-reflection that, in turn, helps develop personal consciousness or an active sense of civic duty.

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Gadamer|Hans-Georg Gadamer]] centered the humanities' attempt to distinguish itself from the natural sciences in [[humankind]]'s urge to understand its own experiences. This understanding, they claimed, ties like-minded people from similar cultural backgrounds together and provides a sense of cultural continuity with the philosophical past.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dilthey|Dilthey, Wilhelm]]. ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in the late 20th and early 21st centuries extended that "narrative imagination"&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, Moira. "Narrative imagination and taking the perspective of others," ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'' 21, 4–5 (July, 2002), 407–416.&lt;/ref&gt; to the ability to understand the records of lived experiences outside of one's own individual social and cultural context. Through that narrative [[imagination]], it is claimed, humanities scholars and students develop a [[conscience]] more suited to the multicultural world we live in.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum, Martha]]. ''[[Martha Nussbaum#Cultivating Humanity|Cultivating Humanity]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That conscience might take the form of a passive one that allows more effective [[self-reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harpham | first1 = Geoffrey | year = 2005 | title = Beneath and Beyond the Crisis of the Humanities | url = | journal = [[New Literary History]] | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 21–36 | doi=10.1353/nlh.2005.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extend into active empathy that facilitates the dispensation of civic duties a responsible world citizen must engage in.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; There is disagreement, however, on the level of influence humanities study can have on an individual and whether or not the understanding produced in humanistic enterprise can guarantee an "identifiable positive effect on people."&lt;ref&gt;Harpham, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanistic theories and practices===
There are three major branches of knowledge: [[natural sciences]], [[social sciences]], and the humanities. [[Technology]] is the practical extension  of the natural sciences, as [[politics]] is the extension of the social sciences. Similarly, the humanities have their own practical extension, sometimes called "transformative humanities" (transhumanities) or "culturonics" ([[Mikhail Epstein]]'s term):
* Nature – natural sciences – technology –&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;transformation of nature
* 
* Society – social sciences –&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;politics&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;transformation of society
* 
* Culture – human sciences –&amp;nbsp;culturonics&amp;nbsp;– transformation of culture&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein. ''The Transformative Humanities: A Manifesto''. New York and London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2012, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
Technology, politics and culturonics are designed to transform what their respective disciplines study: nature, society, and culture. The field of transformative humanities includes various   practicies and technologies, for example, [[language planning]], the construction of new languages, like [[Esperanto]], and invention of new artistic and literary genres and movements in the genre of [[manifesto]], like [[Romanticism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], or [[Surrealism]].  Humanistic [[invention]] in the sphere of culture, as a practice complementary to scholarship, is an important aspect of the humanities.

===Truth and meaning===

The divide between humanistic study and natural sciences informs arguments of meaning in humanities as well. What distinguishes the humanities from the [[natural science]]s is not a certain subject matter, but rather the mode of approach to any question. Humanities focuses on understanding meaning, purpose, and goals and furthers the appreciation of singular historical and social phenomena—an interpretive method of finding "truth"—rather than explaining the causality of events or uncovering the truth of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey, Wilhelm]]. ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its societal application, narrative imagination is an important tool in the (re)production of understood meaning in history, culture and literature.

Imagination, as part of the tool kit of artists or scholars, helps create meaning that invokes a response from an audience. Since a humanities scholar is always within the [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] of lived experiences, no "absolute" knowledge is theoretically possible; knowledge is instead a ceaseless procedure of inventing and reinventing the context a text is read in. [[Poststructuralism]] has problematized an approach to the humanistic study based on questions of meaning, intentionality, and authorship.{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} In the wake of [[Death of the author|the death of the author]] proclaimed by [[Barthes|Roland Barthes]], various theoretical currents such as [[deconstruction]] and [[discourse]] analysis seek to expose the ideologies and rhetoric operative in producing both the purportedly meaningful objects and the [[hermeneutic]] subjects of humanistic study. This exposure has opened up the interpretive structures of the humanities to criticism humanities scholarship is "unscientific" and therefore unfit for inclusion in modern university curricula because of the very nature of its changing contextual meaning.{{Dubious|date=February 2010}}

===Pleasure, the pursuit of knowledge and scholarship===

Some, like [[Stanley Fish]], have claimed that the humanities can defend themselves best by refusing to make any claims of utility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Fish|Fish, Stanley]], [http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#more-81 The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; (Fish may well be thinking primarily of literary study, rather than history and philosophy.) Any attempt to justify the humanities in terms of outside benefits such as social usefulness (say increased productivity) or in terms of ennobling effects on the individual (such as greater wisdom or diminished prejudice) is ungrounded, according to Fish, and simply places impossible demands on the relevant academic departments. Furthermore, [[critical thinking]], while arguably a result of humanistic training, can be acquired in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/the-laws-of-cool-knowledge-work-and-the-culture-of-information-catalogue-copy-and-table-of-contents/ Alan Liu, ''Laws of Cool,'' 2004,]&lt;/ref&gt; And the humanities do not even provide any more the kind of social cachet (what sociologists sometimes call "[[cultural capital]]") that was helpful to succeed in Western society before the age of mass education following World War II.

Instead, scholars like Fish suggest that the humanities offer a unique kind of pleasure, a pleasure based on the common pursuit of knowledge (even if it is only disciplinary knowledge). Such pleasure contrasts with the increasing privatization of leisure and instant gratification characteristic of Western culture; it thus meets [[Jürgen Habermas]]' requirements for the disregard of social status and rational problematization of previously unquestioned areas necessary for an endeavor which takes place in the bourgeois [[public sphere]]. In this argument, then, only the academic pursuit of pleasure can provide a link between the private and the public realm in modern Western consumer society and strengthen that public sphere that, according to many theorists,{{who|date=May 2012}} is the foundation for modern democracy.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Others, like [[Mark Bauerlein]], argue that professors in the humanities have increasingly abandoned proven methods of [[epistemology]] (''I care only about the quality of your arguments, not your conclusions.'') in favor of [[indoctrination]] (''I care only about your conclusions, not the quality of your arguments.''). The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Romanticization and rejection===

Implicit in many of these arguments supporting the humanities are the makings of arguments against public support of the humanities. [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]] asserts that we live in a changing world, a world where "cultural capital" is replaced with ''[[scientific literacy]]'', and in which the romantic notion of a Renaissance humanities scholar is obsolete. Such arguments appeal to judgments and anxieties about the essential uselessness of the humanities, especially in an age when it is seemingly vitally important for scholars of literature, history and the arts to engage in "collaborative work with experimental scientists or even simply to make "intelligent use of the findings from empirical science."&lt;ref&gt;""Theory," Anti-Theory, and Empirical Criticism," ''Biopoetics: Evolutionary Explorations in the Arts'', Brett Cooke and Frederick Turner, eds., Lexington, Kentucky: ICUS Books, 1999, pp. 144–145. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16269">An '''ideograph''' or '''virtue word''' is a word frequently used in political discourse that uses an abstract concept to develop support for political positions. Such words are usually terms that do not have a clear definition but are used to give the impression of a clear meaning. An ideograph in rhetoric often exists as a building block or simply one term or short phrase that summarizes the orientation or attitude of an ideology. Such examples notably include &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom]]&gt;, &lt;[[democracy]]&gt; and &lt;[[rights]]&gt;. Rhetorical critics use chevrons or angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) to mark off ideographs.

The term ideograph was coined by rhetorical scholar and critic [[Michael Calvin McGee]] (1980) describing the use of particular words and phrases as political language in a way that captures (as well as creates or reinforces) particular ideological positions.  McGee sees the ideograph as a way of understanding of how specific, concrete instances of political discourse relate to the more abstract idea of political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, J. (2001).  ''Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robertson defines ideographs as “political slogans or labels that encapsulate ideology in political discourse.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, [[Celeste Condit]] and [[John Lucaites]], influenced by McGee, explain, “Ideographs represent in condensed form the normative, collective commitments of the members of a public, and they typically appear in public argumentation as the necessary motivations or justifications for action performed in the name of the public.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=xxii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideographs are common in [[advertising]] and political discourse.

==Definition==
McGee uses the term in his seminal article “The ‘Ideograph’: A Link Between Rhetoric and Ideology” which appeared in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Speech]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=McGee&gt;McGee, M.C. (1980). The “ideograph”: A link between rhetoric and ideology. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 66'', 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He begins his essay by defining the practice of [[ideology]] as practice of political language in specific contexts—actual discursive acts by individual speakers and writers. The question this raises is how does this practice of [[ideology]] create social control.

McGee’s answer to this is to say that “political language which manifests ideology seems characterized by slogans, a vocabulary of ‘ideographs’ easily mistaken for the technical terminology of [[political philosophy]].”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;  He goes on to offer his definition of “ideograph”:  “an ideograph is an ordinary-language term found in political discourse.  It is a high order abstraction representing commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

An ideograph, then, is not just any particular word or phrase used in political discourse, but one of a particular subset of terms that are often invoked in political discourse but which does not have a clear, univocal definition.  Despite this, in their use, ideographs are often invoked precisely to give the sense of a clearly understood and shared meaning. This potency makes them the primary tools for shaping public decisions. It is in this role as the [[vocabulary]] for public values and decision-making that they are linked to [[ideology]].

== Examples ==
There is no absolute litmus test for what terms are or are not ideographs. Rather, this is a judgment that must be made through the study of specific examples of discourse. However, McGee (and others who have followed him) have identified several examples of ideographs or virtue words in Western liberal political discourse, such as &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom of speech]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, and &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;. In each case, the term does not have a specific [[referent]].  Rather, each term refers to an [[abstraction]] which may have many different meanings depending on its [[context (language use)|context]].  It is in their mutability between circumstances that give the terms such rhetorical power.  If the definition of a term such as &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt; can be stretched to include a particular act or condition, then public support for that act or condition is likely to be stronger than it was previously.

By encapsulating values which are perceived to be widely shared by the community, but which are in fact highly abstract and defined in very different ways by individuals, ideographs provide a potent persuasive tool for the political speaker. McGee offers the example of [[Richard Nixon]]’s attempt to defend his decision not to turn over documents to Congress during the [[Watergate scandal]] by invoking “the principle of [[confidentiality]].” Recognizing that his refusal to submit to Congress could be seen as a violation of the "[[rule of law]]", Nixon pitted "the principle of [[confidentiality]]” against the “[[rule of law]],” despite the fact that these two ideographs would, in the abstract, not likely be seen as in conflict with one another.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt; Nixon, in an attempt to expand the understanding of “the principle of [[confidentiality]]” to cover his own specific refusal to cooperate with Congress, used the abstractness of the term to his benefit, claiming that right to confidentiality was the more central term.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

While the term has remained mostly in this sphere of academic [[rhetorical criticism]], some [[political consulting|political consultants]] and practitioners are becoming savvy to this art.

Ideographs appear in [[advertising]] and [[political campaigns]] regularly, and are crucial to helping the public understand what is really being asked of them. For example, “[[Social equality|equality]]” is a term commonly used in political discourse and rarely defined. It can refer to a situation in which all people have the same opportunities, or a condition in which social resources are distributed uniformly to different individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is the more commonly used definition in US history, according to Condit &amp; Lucaites, although in a socialist or left-leaning political state, the term may refer foremost to the distribution of social resources. Condit and Lucaites depict the racial facet of equality as the dominant meaning in an American context of political discourse, since 1865.&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important ideograph used specifically by U.S. presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks is &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;. The term does not have a clear or specific definition, but when applied to the context in the fear-stricken country after the devastating attacks in 2001, this term held significant weight and meaning to Americans all across the country. Kelly Long explores Obama’s discourse on the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; and states that “by developing an ideological justification for the conflicts that the United States was involved in at the time, Obama remedied much of the damage done by the Bush administration”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=90|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama justified the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; by addressing the nation and saying that in order to protect the &lt;[[rule of law]]&gt; and &lt;democratic values&gt;, we must fight against &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;.  Obama used this term to his advantage and made &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt; appear to be a common enemy and fighting back was the common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=91|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the ideograph unified the country creating a sense of identity for American citizens, “defining what the nation stands for and against. The term divides those who are civilized from those who are uncivilized, those who defend economic freedom from those who would attack America’s way of life and those who support democracy from those who would disrupt it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Carol|title=In the Name of Terrorism: Presidents on Political Violence in the Post-World War II Era|date=2006|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York|page=2|edition=SUNY series on the Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNXc1s_BKSoC&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;ots=YOlgZgkKFn&amp;dq=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marouf Hasian discusses how key ideographs representative of a society’s commitments change over time, particularly in the name of &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;, or &lt;[[privacy]]&gt; epitomized in [[eugenics]]. From the 1900s-1930s, Americans justified the restriction of reproductive rights based on medical, social, economic, and political considerations, but were appalled when the [[Nazis]] used some of the same arguments in their creation of the “perfect race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasian|first=M.A.|title=The rhetoric of eugenics in Anglo-American thought|year=1996|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While rhetorical critics identify these terms as ideographs, political leaders viewed each other’s terms as "[[glittering generalities]],” as Lincoln first identified his opponent's words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|title=Lincoln to Henry Pierce|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/pierce.htm|publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to practitioners, [[marketing|corporate marketing]] and [[political consulting]] use key terms in this way, concentrating on the [[image]] and [[brand management|branding]] of terms. For example, [[Frank Luntz]] tests audience reaction to certain words or phrases using dial technology, a mechanism which instantaneously shows moment by moment reactions to speeches or presentations. This research has been extremely beneficial to his clients, as they can utilize ideographs as "trigger words" in an [[advertising campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luntz|first=Frank|title=Words that work: It’s not what you say, it’s what people hear|year=2007|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
There are three primary ways in which the concept of the ideograph is important to rhetorical critics.  First, it suggests a way of studying political ideology using concrete instances of language use.  By showing how looking at specific uses of key words and phrases in political language reveal underlying ideological commitments, McGee offers a concrete method for understanding the highly abstract concept of ideology.

Second, the definition of the ideograph makes clear that the [[rhetoric|rhetorical study]] of a term is different from a legal, historical, or etymological study of a term. Unlike other perspectives that focus on how a term has changed over time, a rhetorical study of a term focuses on the forces involved in the creation of these meanings. In short, a rhetorical study of a term is the study of the use of that term in practice.

This leads to a third key aspect of what the concept of the ideograph offers to rhetorical critics.  McGee notes that the study of a term must not, and should not, be limited to its use in “formal discourse.” Instead, the critic is much more likely to gain a better understanding of an ideograph by looking at how it is used and depicted in movies, plays, and songs, as well as how it is presented in educational texts aimed at children.  This moves the study of ideology beyond the limits of social philosophy or even political discourse as traditionally conceived (i.e., “great speeches by great men”).

==Cultural variability==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An ideograph is a culturally biased, abstract word or phrase drawn from ordinary language, which serves a constitutional value for a historically situated collectivity."&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There exists a culturally-specific understanding in each culture about what an ideograph means. Ideographs in rhetoric are culturally specific but recur inter-culturally; meaning the understanding of one ideograph can be used and interpreted differently across cultures.  The idea may be different from culture to culture, but this doesn’t mean some aspects won’t be the same in one or more cultures.  Such as the concept of [[femininity]] that exists cross-culturally to define ideas about women, yet one can expect these ideas from culture to culture.

==Critical use==
At the end of his essay defining the ideograph, McGee says that
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
“A complete description of an ideology . . . will consist of (1) the isolation of a society’s ideographs, (2) the exposure and analysis of the [[Synchronic analysis|diachronic]] structure of every ideography, and (3) characterization of [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] relationships among all the ideographs in a particular context.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such an exhaustive study of any ideology has yet to materialize, but many scholars have made use of the ideograph as a tool of understanding both specific [[rhetorical situations]] as well as a broader scope of ideological history. As a teacher, McGee himself made use of the ideograph as a tool for structuring the study of the rise of liberalism in British public address, focusing on ideographs such as &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[patriarchy]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;. Other scholars have made a study of specific uses of ideographs such as &lt;[[family values]]&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, D. L. (1998).  The rhetoric of &lt;family values&gt;: Scapegoating, utopia, and the privatization of social responsibility.  ''Western Journal of Communication, 62'', 387-419.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;[[Egalitarianism|equality]]&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Condit, C. M. &amp; Lucaites, J. L. (1993).  ''Crafting quality: America’s Anglo-African word''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have gone beyond the idea that an ideograph must be a verbal symbol and have expanded the notion to include [[photographs]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. L. &amp; Winkler, C. K. (1997). Representative forms and the visual ideograph: The Iwo Jima image in editorial cartoons.  ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 83'', 289-310.&lt;/ref&gt; and objects represented in [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. P. (1996).  The cigarette as representative ideograph in the debate over environmental tobacco smoke.  ''Communication Monographs, 64'', 47-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ideological criticism''' is a method in [[rhetorical criticism]] concerned with critiquing texts for the dominant ideology they express while silencing opposing or contrary [[ideologies]]. It was started by a group of scholars roughly in the late-1970s through the mid-1980s at universities in the United States. Leading scholars of ideological criticism were Michael Calvin McGee at the University of Iowa and Phillip Wander at San Jose State University. Wander's 1983 article, "The Ideological Turn in Modern Criticism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=March 1983|title=The ideological turn in modern criticism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978309368110?journalCode=rcst19|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/10510978309368110|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1984 article, "The Third Persona: An Ideological Turn in Rhetorical Theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=December 1984|title=The third persona: An ideological turn in rhetorical theory|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978409368190|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=197–216|doi=10.1080/10510978409368190|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain two of the most important articles in the field. According to Sonja Foss, “the primary goal of the ideological critic is to discover and make visible the dominant ideology or ideologies embedded in an artifact and the ideologies that are being muted in it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice (3rd ed.)|last=Foss|first=|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Long Grove, Illinois|pages=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foss has also mentioned the contribution to ideological criticism of several theoretical schools, including [[Marxism]], [[structuralism]], [[cultural studies]], and [[postmodernism]].

==Ideograph==
A unit of analysis in ideological criticism, or what Foss calls "traces of ideology in an artifact," is the [[ideograph (rhetoric)|ideograph]].  It is a symbol representing an ideological concept and is more than what the symbol itself depicts.  Michael McGee, a renowned ideological critic, postulated that an “ideograph is an ordinary term found in political discourse” that “is a high-order abstraction representing collective commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=462–463}}  Thus, McGee restricted ideographs to [[words]], words that “constitute a vocabulary of public motives, which authorize and warrant public actions”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|p=479}}  McGee encourages the study of ideographs (such as “[[liberty]]” and “[[Political freedom|freedom]]”) to help identify the ideological position of a [[society]].  He argues such terms are used in [[discourse]] as a means of justifying problematic issues within a society.  The meaning of an ideograph is defined by a society and its [[culture]] and can change over time.  Ideographs need not be only positive in nature, but can be negative as well.  For example, [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[slavery]], can “guide behavior and belief negatively by branding unacceptable behavior."  McGee notes that to fully understand ideographs, they must be examined both “[[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]” as well as “[[Synchronic analysis|synchronically]].”  That is, ideographs need to be examined across time to determine how their meanings may have changed and all ideographs that are used in a given situation must be considered.

Who in [[democracy]] would be opposed to actions taken under the auspices of liberty and freedom?  To do so would, ideographically speaking, be undemocratic. Citizens of a democratic state are “conditioned” to believe that liberty and freedom are so fundamentally important that society expects those citizens to simply unquestioningly accept actions claiming to be in defense of liberty and freedom.  For example, even within the United States, the ideograph of freedom has changed.  At the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] (1775–1783), freedom meant breaking away from the tyrannical rule of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].  Today, freedom means many things including the freedom to pursue one's dreams and the freedom to be left alone.  People disagree about the freedoms that are most important: freedom to possess guns, freedom to make decisions that affect one's body, freedom from fear or violence, and freedom of movement.  Depending on one's ideological orientation, the ideograph of freedom represents many things, which is why it can be so powerfully used by politicians.  Ideographs succeed in political discourse because of their inability to be concretely understood.  

Ideographs need not be [[Linguistics|verbal]] only; they can be [[Visual communication|visual]] too.  In 1997, Janis Edwards and Carol Winkler expanded the idea of the ideograph to include visual images as well as written words.{{Sfn|Edwards and Winkler 1997|pp=289–310}}  They argue images can act as “a Visual reference point that forms the basis of arguments about a variety of themes and subjects” that are used by both “[[elite]]s and non-elites” alike.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=487–508}}  Like McGee’s textual ideographs, visual ideographs depict common values and goals in a given culture, recur in different contexts over time, and are used to validate arguments and [[Social practice theory|social practice]]s.  Edwards and Winkler mention images of people can act as ideographs too.  “In their construct, a person (character) is abstracted and elevated to the status of a cultural figure, and becomes a surface for the articulation of the political character, employing cultural ideals”.  Foss identifies the following steps in a piece of ideological criticism: 1) “formulate a [[research question]] and select an [[Social artifact|artifact]]”; 2) “select a [[unit of analysis]]” (which she calls “traces of ideology in an artifact”); 3) “analyze the artifact” (which, according to Foss, involves identifying the ideology in the artifact, analyzing the interests the ideology serves, and uncovering the strategies used in the artifact to promote the ideology); and 4) “write the critical essay”.

'''Imagery''', in a literary text, is an author's use of vivid and descriptive language to add depth to their work. It appeals to human senses to deepen the reader's understanding of the work. Powerful forms of imagery engage all of the senses.

==Forms== 
There are seven major types of imagery, each corresponding to a sense, feeling, action, or reaction:

*'''Visual imagery''' pertains to graphics, visual scenes, pictures, or the sense of sight.
*'''Auditory imagery''' pertains to sounds, noises, music, or the sense of hearing. (This kind of imagery may come in the form of [[onomatopoeia]]).
*'''Olfactory imagery''' pertains to odors, scents, or the sense of smell.
*'''Gustatory imagery''' pertains to flavors or the sense of taste.
*'''Tactile imagery''' pertains to physical textures or the sense of touch.

===Less used===
*'''Kinesthetic imagery''' pertains to movements.
*'''Organic imagery / subjective imagery''', pertains to personal experiences of a character's body, including emotion and the senses of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetics of Robert Frost: Examples|url=http://www.frostfriends.org/imagery.html|publisher=Friends of Robert Frost|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6015">'''Kinesics''' is the interpretation of body motion communication such as [[facial expression]]s and [[gesture]]s, nonverbal behavior related to movement of any part of the body or the body as a whole. The equivalent popular culture term is [[body language]], a term [[Ray Birdwhistell]], considered the founder of this area of study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danesi|first1=M|title=Kinesics|journal=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|date=2006|pages=207–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither used nor liked (on the grounds that what can be conveyed with the body does not meet the linguist's definition of language).

==Birdwhistell's work==
Kinesics was first used in 1952 by an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] named [[Ray Birdwhistell]]. Birdwhistell wished to study how people communicate through posture, gesture, stance and movement.&lt;ref&gt;Birdwhistell, R. L. (1952). Introduction to ''Kinesics: An Annotation System for Analysis of Body Motion and Gesture''. Washington, DC: Department of State, Foreign Service Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas over several decades were synthesized and resulted in the book ''Kinesics and Context.''&lt;ref&gt;Birdwhistell, R. 1970. ''Kinesics and Context''. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in kinesics specifically and nonverbal behavior generally was popularized in the late 1960s and early 1970s by such popular mass market (nonacademic) publications as ''How to Read a Person Like a Book''.&lt;ref&gt;Nierenberg, G. I., &amp; Calero, H. H. (1971). ''How to Read a Person Like a Book''. New York: Hawthorn Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Birdwhistell's work involved filming people in social situations and analyzing them to show elements of communication that were not clearly seen otherwise. One of his most important projects was ''The Natural History of an Interview,'' a long-term interdisciplinary collaboration including [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]], Norman A. McQuown, Henry W. Brosin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Jump up ^ Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (1987). The Social History of The Natural History of an Interview: A multidisciplinary investigation of social communication. ''Research on Language and Social Interaction'', 20, 1-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing heavily on [[descriptive linguistics]], Birdwhistell argued that all movements of the body have meaning and that nonverbal behavior has a [[grammar]] that can be analyzed in similar terms to spoken language. Thus, a "kineme" is "similar to a [[phoneme]] because it consists of a group of movements which are not identical, but which may be used interchangeably without affecting social meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, M. 1972. ''Nonverbal Communication in Human Interaction''. Reinhart and Winston, New York, pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birdwhistell estimated that no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, R. 1980. Profile: Ray L. Birdwhistell. ''The Kinesis Report'', 2, 3: 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He also concluded that there were no universals in these kinesic displays, a claim that was disputed by [[Paul Ekman]], who was interested in analysis of universals, especially in [[facial expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P|last2= Friesen|first2= W|year= 1971|title= Constants across cultures in the face and emotion|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 17|issue= 2|pages=124–9 |url=http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Constants-Across-Cultures-In-The-Face-And-Emotion.pdf|pmid= 5542557|doi= 10.1037/h0030377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern applications==
In a current application, kinesic behaviors are sometimes used as signs of [[deception]] by interviewers looking for clusters of movements to determine the veracity of the statement being uttered, although kinesics can be equally applied in any context and type of setting to construe innocuous messages whose carriers are indolent or unable to express verbally.

Kinesic behaviors are an important part of [[nonverbal communication]]. Body movements convey information, but interpretations vary by culture. As many movements are carried out at a subconscious or at least a low-awareness level, kinesic movements carry a significant risk of being misinterpreted in an intercultural communication situation.

{{Anthropology of kinship|terms}}
{{Anthropology}}

'''Kinship terminology''' is the system used in [[language]]s to refer to the persons to whom an individual is related through [[kinship]]. Different societies classify kinship relations differently and therefore use different systems of kinship terminology; for example, some languages distinguish between [[consanguine]] and [[Affinal kin|affinal]] uncles (i.e. the brothers of one's parents and the husbands of the sisters of one's parents, respectively), whereas others have only one word to refer to both a father and his brothers. Kinship terminologies include the terms of address used in different languages or communities for different relatives and the terms of reference used to identify the relationship of these relatives to ego or to each other.

==Historical view==
[[Anthropologist]] [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881) performed the first survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world. Though much of his work is now considered dated, he argued that [[kinship]] terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions. For example, most kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes (the difference between a brother and a sister) and between generations (the difference between a child and a parent). Moreover, he argued, kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and [[marriage]] (although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than blood).

However, Morgan also observed that different languages (and, by extension, societies) organize these distinctions differently. He proposed to describe kinship terms and terminologies as either descriptive or [[Classificatory kinship|classificatory]]. When a descriptive term is used, it can only represent one type of relationship between two people, while a classificatory term represents one of many different types of relationships. For example, the word ''[[brother]]'' in English-speaking societies indicates a son of the same parent; thus, English-speaking societies use the word ''brother'' as a descriptive term.  A person's male first cousin could be the mother's brother's son, mother's sister's son, father's brother's son, father's sister's son, and so on; English-speaking societies therefore use the word ''cousin'' as a classificatory term.

Morgan discovered that a descriptive term in one society can become a classificatory term in another society.  For example, in some societies, one would refer to many different people as "mother" (the woman who gave birth to oneself, as well as her sister and husband's sister, and also one's father's sister). Moreover, some societies do not group together relatives which the English-speaking societies classify together. For example, some languages have no one-word equivalent to ''cousin'', because different terms refer to one's mother's sister's children and to one's father's sister's children.

Armed with these different terms, Morgan identified six basic patterns of kinship terminologies:

*[[Hawaiian kinship]]: the most classificatory; only distinguishes between sex and generation.  Thus, siblings and cousins are not distinguished (the same terms are used for both types of relatives).
*[[Sudanese kinship]]: the most descriptive; no two types of relatives share the same term.  Siblings are distinguished from cousins, and different terms are used for each type of cousin (i.e. father's brother's children, father's sister's children, mother's sister's children and mother's brother's children).
*[[Eskimo kinship]]: has both classificatory and descriptive terms; in addition to sex and generation, it also distinguishes between lineal relatives (those related directly by a line of descent) and collateral relatives (those related by blood, but not directly in the line of descent). Lineal relatives have highly descriptive terms; collateral relatives have highly classificatory terms.  Thus, siblings are distinguished from cousins, while all types of cousins are grouped together.  The system of English-language kinship terms falls into the Eskimo type.
*[[Iroquois kinship]]: has both classificatory and descriptive terms; in addition to sex and generation, it also distinguishes between siblings of opposite sexes in the parental generation. A genealogical relationship traced through a pair of siblings of the same sex is classed as a blood relationship, but one traced though a pair of siblings of the opposite sex can be considered an in-law relationship. In other words, siblings are grouped together with [[parallel cousin]]s, while separate terms are used for [[cross-cousin]]s.  Also, one calls one's mother's sister "mother" and one's father's brother "father".  However, one refers to one's mother's brother and one's father's sister by separate terms (often the terms for ''father-in-law'' and ''mother-in-law'', since cross-cousins can be preferential marriage partners).
*[[Crow kinship]]: like Iroquois, but further distinguishes between one's mother's side and one's father's side. Relatives on the mother's side of the family have more descriptive terms, and relatives on the father's side have more classificatory terms.  Thus, Crow kinship is like Iroquois kinship, with the addition that a number of relatives belonging to one's father's matrilineage are grouped together, ignoring generational differences, so that the same term is used for both one's father's sister and one's father's sister's daughter, etc.
*[[Omaha kinship]]: like Iroquois, but further distinguishes between one's mother's side and one's father's side. Relatives on the mother's side of the family have more classificatory terms, and relatives on the father's side have more descriptive terms.  Thus, Omaha kinship is like Iroquois, with the addition that a number of relatives belonging to one's mother's patrilineage are grouped together, ignoring generational differences, so that the same term is used for both one's mother's brother and one's mother's brother's son, etc.

The basic principles of Crow and Omaha terminologies are symmetrical and opposite, with Crow systems having a matrilineal emphasis and Omaha systems a patrilineal emphasis.

==Relative age==
Some languages, such as [[Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (see [[Chinese kinship]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], Cambodian, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Nepali language|Nepalese,]] and [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] add another dimension to some relations: relative age. Rather than one term for "brother", there exist, for example, different words for "older brother" and "younger brother". In Tamil, an older male sibling is referred to as ''Annan'' and a younger male sibling as ''Thambi'', whereas older and younger female siblings are called ''Akka'' and ''Thangai'' respectively.

==Identification of alternating generations==
Other languages, such as [[Chiricahua language|Chiricahua]], use the same terms of address for alternating generations. So a Chiricahua child (male or female) calls their paternal grandmother ''-ch’iné'', and likewise this grandmother will call her son's child ''-ch’iné''. Similar features are seen also in [[Huichol language|Huichol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Myerhoff|first=Barbara G.|year=1974|title=Peyote Hunt: The Sacred Journey of the Huichol Indians|location=Ithaca|publisher=Cornell, University Press|page=66|isbn=&lt;!--0-8014-9137-1--&gt;|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Stacy and Peter T.

Terms that recognize alternating generations and the prohibition of marriage within one's own set of alternate generation relatives (0, ±2, ±4, etc.) are common in [[Australian Aboriginal kinship]].

The relative age and alternating-generations systems are combined in some languages.  For instance,
[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] borrows the relative age system of the [[Chinese kinship]] and follows the generation system of kinship. [[Philippine Kinship|Philippine kinship]] distinguishes between generation, age and in some cases, gender.

Floyd Lounsbury described&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 351–393 | editors = Ward H.

The basic idea is that of applying an even/odd distinction to relatives that takes into account the gender of every linking relative for ego’s kin relation to any given person. A MFBD(C), for example, is a mother’s father’s brother’s daughter’s child. If each female link (M,D) is assigned a 0 and each male (F,B) a 1, the number of 1s is either even or odd; in this case, even. However, variant criteria exist.&lt;!-- which, ideally, would be detailed here. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a Dravidian or Tamil system with a patrilineal [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]-2 counting system, marriage is prohibited with this relative, and a marriageable relative must be modulo-2 odd. There exists also a version of this logic with a matrilineal bias. Discoveries of systems that use modulo-2 logic, as in South Asia, Australia, and many other parts of the world, marked a major advance in the understanding of kinship terminologies that differ from kin relations and terminologies employed by Europeans.

The Dravidian or Tamil kinship system involves selective cousinhood. One's father's brother's children and one's mother's sister's children are ''not'' cousins but brothers and sisters one step removed. They are considered ''consanguineous'' (''pangali'' in Tamil), and marriage with them is strictly forbidden as incestuous. However, one's father's sister's children and one's mother's brother's children are considered cousins and potential mates (''muraicherugu'' in Tamil). Marriages between such cousins are allowed and encouraged. There is a clear distinction between [[cross cousin|cross cousins,]] who are one's true cousins and [[parallel cousin|parallel cousins,]] who are, in fact, siblings. Like Iroquois people, Dravidians use the same words to refer to their father's sister and mother-in-law (''atthai'' in Tamil &amp; ''atthe'' in Kannada) and their mother's brother and father-in-law ( Maamaa in Tamil &amp;''maava'' in Kannada). In Kannada, ''sodara'' is added before ''atthe'' and ''maava'' to specifically refer to father's sister and mother's brother respectively, although it is not used in direct address where as in Tamil only mother''s brother is captioned with "Thaai" before "maamaa" to specify it as mother''s brother (he is respected with high regards in their customs).

==Abbreviations for genealogical relationships==
The genealogical terminology used in many genealogical charts describes relatives of the subject in question. Using the abbreviations below, genealogical relationships may be distinguished by single or compound relationships, such as BC for a brother's children, MBD for a mother's brother's daughter, and so forth.

*B = Brother 
*C = Child(ren) 
*D = Daughter 
*F = Father 
*GC = Grandchild(ren) 
*GP = Grandparent(s) 
*H = Husband 
*LA = In-law 
*M = Mother 
*P = Parent 
*S = Son 
*SI = Siblings
*SP = Spouse 
*W = Wife 
*Z = Sister 
*(m.s.) = male speaking 
*(f.s.) = female speaking

{{TOC right}}

==In society==
'''[[Anomie]]''' is a breakdown of social bonds between an individual and their community, in which individuals do not feel bound by the moral strictures of society. The term was popularized by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] in his influential 1897 book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mestrovic |first=Stjepan |title=Emile Durkheim and The Reformation of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchy]]''' (meaning "without leadership") is a condition in which a person or group of people reject societal hierarchies, laws, and other institutions. It often entails the dissolution of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1551642484 |title=Decentralism: Where It Came From-Where Is It Going? |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchism]]''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies." George Woodcock. "Anarchism" at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. "Anarchism" from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anarchism." The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 "Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state." Judith Suissa. ''Anarchism and Education: a Philosophical Perspective''. Routledge. New York. 2006. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organisation and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist." [[Peter Kropotkin]]. [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Anarchism__its_philosophy_and_ideal.html Anarchism: its philosophy and ideal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society."

'''[[Civil disorder]]''', or civil unrest, refers to public disturbances generally involving groups of people, and resulting in danger or damage to persons or property.&lt;ref&gt;Schurink, W.J. (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KMlv2eJozAUC&amp;pg=PA416 ''Victimization: Nature and Trends.''] Human Sciences Research Council. {{ISBN|0796912580}}. p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil disorder is a breakdown of civil society, and may be a form of protest. It may take various forms, such as illegal parades, sit-ins, riots, sabotage, and other forms of crime.

==In nature==
'''[[Randomness]]''' is the lack of [[pattern]] or [[predictability]] in events.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines "random" as "Having no definite aim or purpose; not sent or guided in a particular direction; made, done, occurring, etc., without method or conscious choice; haphazard."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
'''[[Antinomianism]]''', in [[Christianity]], is a theological position which takes the principle of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] by [[Faith#Christianity|faith]] and [[divine grace]] to the point of asserting that the saved are not bound to follow the [[Law of Moses]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28267/antinomianism Encyclopædia Britannica: Antinomianism]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of a [[trial]], a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]], [[Discovery (law)|discovery]], or other kinds of [[legal proceedings]], the resolution of certain [[Question of fact|questions of fact]] or [[question of law|law]] may hinge on the application of one or more legal tests.

Legal tests are often formulated from the logical analysis of a judicial decision or a court order where it appears that a [[finder of fact]] or the [[court]] made a particular decision after contemplating a well-defined set of circumstances. It is assumed that evaluating any given set of circumstances under a legal test will lead to an unambiguous and repeatable result. &lt;!-- this needs to be clarified --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2622">The '''Library of Latin Texts''' (LLT) is a subscription-based database of Latin texts, from Antiquity up to the present day. First started in 1991 as the ''Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts'' (CLCLT), it continues to be developed by the ''Centre ‘Traditio Litterarum Occidentalium’'' and is hosted by [[Brepols Publishers]].

== History ==
In 1991, development of the ''Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts'' (CLCLT) started, with the aim of encompassing the entirety of Christian Latin literature. This digital database, initially released as a [[CD-ROM]], was produced by the Cetedoc, led by prof. [[Paul Tombeur]] at the [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. Since 2001, the activities of Cetedoc have been continued in Turnhout by the ''Centre ‘Traditio Litterarum Occidentalium’'' (CTLO), still led by Paul Tombeur.

When in 2002, the decision was made to expand the database's chronological scope beyond Medieval and Patristic times, its name was changed to ''Library of Latin Texts''. A further development followed in 2009. Then, a B series (LLT-B) was added to the original LLT (hence known as LLT-A). The LLT-B's scope was to accelerate the growth of the database by directly adopting the text of existing editions, without the intensive research work that is applied to the texts of the LLT-A. This work includes verifying facts related to the text and correcting errors in the printed edition.&lt;ref name="Brepolis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brepolis.net/pdf/Brepolis_LLT_EN.pdf|title=Library of Latin Texts|publisher=BREPOL&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;S|accessdate=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between the LLT and similar databases ==
Unlike similar initiatives, like [[Corpus Corporum]] or [[The Latin Library]], the LLT is not an open-access database. This allows for the adoption of copyrighted editions. In fact, while open-access initiatives have to rely on out-of-copyright, possibly outdated editions, the LLT's policy is to select texts that have "been edited according to best contemporary scholarly practice".&lt;ref name="Brepolis" /&gt;

The '''Mesoamerican Long Count calendar''' is a non-repeating, [[vigesimal]] (base-20) and base-18 calendar used by several [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures, most notably the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. For this reason, it is often known as the '''Maya''' (or '''Mayan''') '''Long Count calendar'''. Using a modified vigesimal tally, the Long Count calendar identifies a day by counting the number of days passed since a [[Mesoamerican creation myths|mythical creation date]] that corresponds to August 11, 3114 [[Common Era|BCE]] in the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref group=n&gt;The correlation between the Long Count and Western calendars is calculated according to the one used by a majority of Maya researchers, known as the (modified) GMT or Goodman-Martinez-Thompson correlation. An alternate correlation sometimes used puts the starting date two days later. August 11, 3114&amp;nbsp;BCE is a date in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], which is to September 6, -3113 [[Julian calendar|Julian]] [[astronomical year numbering|astronomical]]. See [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar#Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count|Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count calendar section]] elsewhere in this article for details on correlations.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Long Count calendar was widely used on monuments.

==Background==
The two most widely used calendars in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, were the 260-day [[Tzolk'in]] and the 365 day [[Haab']]. The equivalent Aztec calendars are known in [[Nahuatl]] as the [[tonalpohualli]] and [[Xiuhpohualli]].

The combination of a Haab' and a Tzolk'in date identifies a day in a combination which does not occur again for 18,980 days (52 Haab' cycles of 365 days times 73 Tzolk'in cycles of 260 days, approximately 52 years), a period known as the [[Calendar Round]]. To identify days over periods longer than this, Mesoamericans used the Long Count calendar.

==Long Count periods==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}&lt;!--only one citation--&gt;
[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|266x266px|Detail showing columns of glyphs from a portion of the 2nd century CE [[La Mojarra Stela 1]]. The left column gives a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.7, or 156 CE. The others columns visible are glyphs from the [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]
The Long Count calendar identifies a date by counting the number of days from a starting date that is generally calculated to be August 11, 3114&amp;nbsp;BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or September 6 in the Julian calendar (or −3113 in astronomical year numbering). There has been much debate over the precise correlation between the Western calendars and the Long Count calendars. The August 11 date is based on the GMT correlation (see [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar#Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count|Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count calendar section]] elsewhere in this article for details on correlations).

The completion of 13 [[Baktun|b'ak'tuns]] (August 11, 3114&amp;nbsp;BCE) marks the Creation of the world of human beings according to the Maya. On this day, Raised-up-Sky-Lord caused three stones to be set by associated gods at Lying-Down-Sky, First-Three-Stone-Place. Because the sky still lay on the primordial sea, it was black. The setting of the three stones centered the cosmos which allowed the sky to be raised, revealing the {{nowrap|sun.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, Schele &amp; Parker (1993, pp. 59–75).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rather than using a base-10 scheme, like Western numbering, the Long Count days were tallied in a modified base-20 scheme. In a pure base-20 scheme, 0.0.0.1.5 is equal to 25 and 0.0.0.2.0 is equal to 40. The Long Count is not pure base-20, however, since the second digit from the right (and only that digit) rolls over to zero when it reaches 18.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Thus 0.0.1.0.0 does not represent 400 days, but rather only 360 days and 0.0.0.17.19 represents 359 days.

The name ''b'ak'tun'' was invented by modern scholars. The numbered Long Count was no longer in use by the time the Spanish arrived in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], although unnumbered [[k'atun]]s and tuns were still in use. Instead the Maya were using an abbreviated [[Maya calendar#Short Count|Short Count]].

==Mesoamerican numerals==
[[File:maya.svg|thumb|Maya numerals]]
Long Count dates are written with Mesoamerican numerals, as shown on this table. A dot represents ''1'' while a bar equals ''5''. The shell glyph was used to represent the zero concept. The Long Count calendar required the use of zero as a place-holder and presents one of the earliest uses of the [[0 (number)#History|zero concept in history]].

On Maya monuments, the Long Count syntax is more complex. The date sequence is given once, at the beginning of the inscription and opens with the so-called ISIG (Introductory Series Initial Glyph) which reads ''tzik-a(h) hab’ [patron of Haab' month]'' ("revered was the year-count with the patron [of the month]").&lt;ref&gt;Boot, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Next come the 5 digits of the Long Count, followed by the Calendar Round (tzolk'in and Haab') and [[Maya calendar#Supplementary Series|supplementary series]]. The supplementary series is optional and contains lunar data, for example, the age of the moon on the day and the calculated length of current lunation.&lt;ref group=n&gt;Notable in this sequence is the glyph with nine variant forms labeled G by early epigraphers. It has been connected with the cycle of Lords of the Night known from colonial era sources in Central Mexico but alternate explanations have also been offered. See Thompson.&lt;/ref&gt; The text then continues with whatever activity occurred on that date.

A drawing of a full Maya Long Count inscription is shown [[#Calculating a full Long Count date|below]].

==Earliest Long Counts==
The earliest contemporaneous Long Count inscription yet discovered is on Stela 2 at [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]], [[Chiapas]], Mexico, showing a date of 36&amp;nbsp;BCE, although Stela 2 from [[Takalik Abaj]], [[Guatemala]] might be earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Graham (1992, p. 331, see Fig. 5 for a line drawing of the monument)&lt;/ref&gt; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Abaj_Takalik_Stela2.jpg] Takalik Abaj Stela 2's highly battered Long Count inscription shows 7 ''bak'tuns'', followed by ''k'atuns'' with a tentative 6 coefficient, but that could also be 11 or 16, giving the range of possible dates to fall between 236 and 19&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref group=n&gt;To clarify, there are Long Count inscriptions which refer to dates earlier than the 1st century BCE, but these were carved much later in a retrospective fashion.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Some sources identify just Baktun 7, though Katun 6–16 is at least consistent with Mora-Marín (2005)'s 236–19&amp;nbsp;BCE|date=February 2014}}  

Although Takalik Abaj Stela 2 remains controversial, this table includes it, as well as six other artifacts with the eight oldest Long Count inscriptions according to Dartmouth professor Vincent H. Malmström (two of the artifacts contain two dates and Malmström does not include Takalik Abaj Stela 2).&lt;ref name=malmstrom1997&gt;{{ cite book | first=Vincent Herschel | last=Malmström | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~izapa/CS-MM-Chap.%206.htm | title=Cycles of the Sun, Mysteries of the Moon | chapter=Chapter 6 | date=1997 | publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] | isbn=978-0-292-75197-2 }} Note: Malmström's Gregorian dates are three or four days later than a correlation of 584283 would give (the Wikipedia table has been corrected).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Vincent H.

Of the six sites, three are on the western edge of the Maya homeland and three are several hundred kilometers further west, leading some researchers to believe that the Long Count calendar predates the Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (2004, p. 186).&lt;/ref&gt; La Mojarra Stela 1, the Tuxtla Statuette, Tres Zapotes Stela C and Chiapa Stela 2 are all inscribed in an [[Epi-Olmec script|Epi-Olmec]], not Maya, style.&lt;ref&gt;"A sketch of prior documentation of epi-Olmec texts", Section 5 in Peréz de Lara &amp; Justeson (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  El Baúl Stela 2, on the other hand, was created in the [[Izapa]]n style.

The first unequivocally Maya artifact is Stela 29 from [[Tikal]], with the Long Count date of 292 CE (8.12.14.8.15), more than 300 years after Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.&lt;ref&gt;Coe &amp; Koontz (2002, p. 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, with the discovery in Guatemala of the [[San Bartolo (Maya site)]] stone block text (c.a. 300&amp;nbsp;BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Saturno et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; it has been argued that this text celebrates an upcoming time period ending celebration. This time period may have been projected to end sometime between 7.3.0.0.0 and 7.5.0.0.0 — 295 and 256&amp;nbsp;BCE, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Giron-Abrego 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides this being the earliest Maya hieroglyphic text so far uncovered, it would arguably be the earliest glyphic evidence to date of Long Count notation in Mesoamerica.

==Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count==
[[File:Estela C de Tres Zapotes.jpg|thumb|250px||The back of Stela C from [[Tres Zapotes]], an Olmec archaeological site.&lt;br&gt;This is the second oldest Long Count date yet discovered. The numerals 7.16.6.16.18 translate to September 1, 32&amp;nbsp;BCE (Gregorian). The glyphs surrounding the date are what is thought to be one of the few surviving examples of [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]

The Maya and Western calendars are correlated by using a [[Julian day number]] (JDN) of the starting date of the current creation — 13.0.0.0.0, 4 [[Ajaw]], 8 Kumk'u.&lt;ref group=n&gt;All extant Maya inscriptions that represent this base date wrote it with a "13" bak'tuns, not "0". But when using "13.0.0.0.0" as a base date in calculations, the "13" bak'tuns has the numerical value 0, as if it were written as "''0''.0.0.0.0". This is easily confused when the "13" bak'tuns has the actual value 13 in the ''current'' bakt'un, as in the Maya date for today: {{Maya date}} (={{CURRENTDATE}}).&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred to as a correlation constant. The generally accepted correlation constant is the Modified Thompson 2, "[[Joseph T. Goodman|Goodman]]–Martinez–[[J. Eric S. Thompson|Thompson]]", or GMT correlation of 584,283 days. Using the GMT correlation, the current creation started on September 6, −3113 ([[Julian calendar|Julian]] astronomical) – August 11, 3114 BCE in the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. The study of correlating the Maya and western calendar is referred to as the correlation question.&lt;ref name="mesoweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/publications/CAA_14/Thompson1935.pdf |title= Maya chronology: The correlation question by J.

In ''Breaking the Maya Code'', [[Michael D. Coe]] writes: "In spite of oceans of ink that have been spilled on the subject, there now is not the slightest chance that these three scholars (conflated to GMT when talking about the correlation) were not right...".&lt;ref&gt;''Breaking the Maya Code'', 1992, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence for the GMT correlation is historical, astronomical and archaeological:

'''Historical''': Calendar Round dates with a corresponding [[Julian calendar|Julian date]] are recorded in [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]'' (written circa 1566), the Chronicle of Oxcutzkab and the books of [[Chilam Balam]]. De Landa records a date that is a Tun ending in the [[Maya calendar#Short Count|Short Count]]. Oxkutzcab contains 12 Tun endings. Bricker and Bricker find that only the GMT correlation in consistent with these dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bricker |first1=Harvey M. |last2=Bricker |first2=Victoria Reifler |date=August 1, 2011 |title=Astronomy in the Maya Codices |series=Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society |publisher=American Philosophical Society |page=85 |isbn=978-0871692658 |quote=if the 12 tun endings in the Chronicle of Oxkutzcab are accepted as referring to the 12 consecutive years and if the calendar-round dates (except that containing the month of Ceh) are correct when translated to a common calendar, the “11.16” correlation is the only possible one.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel Ralph L. Roys, Washington D.C.; Carnegie Institution 1933, pp. 79, 83&lt;/ref&gt; contains the only colonial reference to classic long-count dates. The Julian calendar date of 11.16.0.0.0 confirms the GMT correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edmonson |first1=Munro S. |date=December 1976 |title=The Mayan Calendar Reform of 11.16.0.0.0 |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=17 |issue= 4 |pages=713–17 |jstor=2741269 |doi=10.1086/201806}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Annals of the Cakchiquels]] contains numerous Tzolk'in dates correlated with European dates. These confirm the GMT correlation.{{sfn|Recinos and Goetz|p=33 Recinos gives 2 Tihax (Etz'nab') is September 10, 1541([[Julian calendar|Julian]]). The date which marked the destruction of the city of Guatemala founded at the foot of the Volcano of Agua. "After a period of heavy rain there was an earthquake and then a flood of water (a [[lahar]]) that destroyed the old city of Guatemala"}} Weeks, Sachse and Prager transcribed three divinatory calendars from highland Guatemala. They found that the 1772 calendar confirms the GMT correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weeks |first1=John M. |last2=Sachse |first2=Frauke |last3=Prager |first3=Christian M.|date=May 15, 2013 |title=Maya Daykeeping: Three Calendars from Highland Guatemala (Mesoamerican Worlds) |url= |location= |publisher=University Press of Colorado |pages=176–84 |isbn=978-1607322467}} In Appendix 2, ''Notes on the Correlation of Maya and Gregorian Calendars'', the authors give the examples of December 9, 1722 = 8 Kej 20 Ukab’ Si’j (8 Manik' 0 Yax) and December 9, 1723 = 9 E 20 Ukab’ Si’j (9 Eb' 0 Yax). "Using Thompson’s correlation constant of A = 584,283, all values from the calendar round correspond with the information in the 1722 K’iche’ calendar."&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the capital city of the Aztec Empire, [[Tenochtitlan]], occurred on August 13, 1521.&lt;ref&gt;(Díaz 1904: 2:129)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of different chroniclers wrote that this was a [[Tzolk'in]] ([[Tonalpohualli]]) of 1 Snake.&lt;ref&gt;(Sahagún 1975: 12:122)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astronomical''': Any correct correlation must match the astronomical content of classic inscriptions. The GMT correlation does an excellent job of matching lunar data in the [[Maya calendar#Supplementary Series|supplementary series]].&lt;ref name="astras-stargate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astras-stargate.com/lunarglyphs.html |title=Lunar Glyphs in the Maya Calendrics – The Lunar Series – The Supplementary and Lunar Glyphs |publisher=astras-stargate.com|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: An inscription at the Temple of the Sun at [[Palenque]] records that on Long Count 9.16.4.10.8 there were 26 days completed in a 30-day lunation.&lt;ref&gt;Fuls, Ancient Mesoamerica, 18 (2007), 273–282 Cambridge University Press. after Robertson 1991: Vol. 4 : p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; This Long Count is also the entry date for the eclipse table of the [[Dresden Codex]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblioteces.net/ciencia/dresden/dresdencodex03.htm The Dresden Codex eclipse table by Michael John Finley]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref|According to Thompson&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. Eric S. (1950). Maya Hieroglyphic Writing, an Introduction. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; "The point from which the moon age is counted is not surely known. The possibilities are disappearance of the old moon, conjunction, or appearance of the new moon... Beyer (1973a) believed that the calculation was made from the disappearance of the old moon. The latter method of counting (disappearance of the old moon) is still current in some Tzeltal, Chol, and Tzotzil villages in Chiapas..."

Using the third method (the Palenque system&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 2001&lt;/ref&gt;) the new moon would have been the first evening when one could look to the west after sunset and see the thin crescent moon. Given our modern ability to know exactly where to look, when the crescent Moon is favorably located, from an excellent site, on rare occasions, using binoculars or a telescope, observers can see and photograph the crescent moon less than one day after conjunction. Generally, most observers can't see the new Moon with the naked eye until the first evening when the lunar phase day is at least 1.5.&lt;ref&gt;"Sighting the Crescent Moon", ''Sky &amp; Telescope'', July 1994, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In Quest of the Youngest Moon", ''Sky &amp; Telescope'', December 1996, 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Young Moons and the Islamic Calendar", ''Sky &amp; Telescope'', December 1996, 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Seeking Thin Crescent Moons", ''Sky &amp; Telescope'', February 2004, 102–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Young-Moon Hunting in 2005", ''Sky and Telescope'', February 2005, 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=
What’s the Thinnest Crescent Moon You Can See? | publisher=Sky and Telescope |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/thinnest-crescent-moon/}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one assumes that the new moon is the first day when the lunar phase day is at least 1.5 at six in the evening in time zone UTC−6 (the time zone of the Maya area) the GMT correlation will match many lunar inscriptions exactly. In this example the lunar phase day was 27.7 (26 days counting from zero) at 6&amp;nbsp;pm after a conjunction at 1:25&amp;nbsp;am {{nowrap|October 10, 755}} and a new Moon when the lunar phase day was 1.7 at 6&amp;nbsp;pm on {{nowrap|October 11, 755}} (Julian calendar). This works well for many but not all lunar inscriptions.

Modern astronomers refer to the conjunction of the Sun and Moon (the time when the Sun and Moon have the same ecliptic longitude) as the new moon. Mesoamerican astronomy was ''observational'' not theoretical. The people of Mesoamerica didn't know about the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] nature of the solar system — they had no theoretical understanding of the orbital nature of the heavenly bodies. Some authors analyze the lunar inscriptions based on this modern understanding of the motions of the Moon but there is no evidence that the Mesoamericans did.

The first method seems to have been used for other inscriptions such as Quirgua stela E (9.17.0.0.0). Using the third method it should have a moon age of 26 days when in fact it records a new moon.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mayan and Other Ancient Calendars|author=Stray, G.|date=2007|publisher=Walker|isbn=978-0-8027-1634-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GdlzA3yUlTUC&amp;pg=PA40|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the GMT correlation at six AM in time zone -six, this would be 2.25 days before conjunction, so it could record the first day when one could not see the waning moon.

Fuls&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Fuls Ancient Mesoamerica, 18 (2007), 273–282 Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Analysed these inscriptions and found strong evidence for the Palenque system and the GMT correlation however he cautioned: "Analysis of the Lunar Series shows that at least two different methods and formulas were used to calculate the moon's age and position in the six-month cycle…"|group=n}} which gives eclipse seasons when the Moon is near its [[Ascending node|ascending]] or [[Ascending node|descending]] node and an [[eclipse]] is likely to occur. Dates converted using the GMT correlation agree closely with the Dresden Codex eclipse tables.&lt;ref&gt;Bricker and Bricker pp. 249–366&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dresden Codex]] contains a [[Venus]] table which records the [[heliacal rising]]s of Venus. Using the GMT correlation these agree closely with modern astronomical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Bricker and Bricker pp. 163–248&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaeological''': Various items that can be associated with specific Long Count dates have been [[Isotope dating|isotope dated]]. In 1959 the [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[carbon dating|carbon dated]] samples from ten wood lintels from [[Tikal]].&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Review of radiocarbon dates from Tikal and the Maya calendar correlation problem|author= Elizabeth K. Ralph|publisher=jstor.org|jstor = 277941|volume=30|pages=421–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were carved with a date equivalent to 741&amp;nbsp;AD, using the GMT correlation. The average [[carbon dating|carbon date]] was 746±34 years. Recently one of these, Lintel 3 from Temple I, was analyzed again using more accurate methods and found to agree closely with the GMT correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennett|first1=Douglas J.|last2=Hajdas|first2=Irka|last3=Culleton|first3=Brendan J.|last4=Belmecheri|first4=Soumaya|last5=Martin|first5=Simon|last6=Neff|first6=Hector|last7=Awe|first7=Jaime|last8=Graham|first8=Heather V.|last9=Freeman|first9=Katherine H.|last10=Newsom|first10=Lee|last11=Lentz|first11=David L.|last12=Anselmetti|first12=Flavio S.|last13=Robinson|first13=Mark|last14=Marwan|first14=Norbert|last15=Southon|first15=John|last16=Hodell|first16=David A.|last17=Haug|first17=Gerald H.|display-authors=1|title=Correlating the Ancient Maya and Modern European Calendars with High-Precision AMS 14C Dating|journal=Scientific Reports|date=11 April 2013|volume=3|pages=1597|doi=10.1038/srep01597|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01597|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1597K|pmid=23579869|pmc=3623374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a proposed correlation only has to agree with one of these lines of evidence there could be numerous other possibilities. Astronomers have proposed many correlations, for example: [[Floyd Lounsbury|Lounsbury]],&lt;ref&gt;A Derivation of the Maya-to-Julian Calendar Correlation From the Dresden Codex Venus Chronology, in ''The Sky In Mayan Literature'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Fuls, ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="archaeoastronomie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeoastronomie.de/mayaeng/corrtabl.htm |title=The Correlation Question by Andreas Fuls |publisher=archaeoastronomie.de|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Böhm and Böhm&lt;ref name="hermetic2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/maya/boehm/korelaceangl.doc |title= Mayan Dating by Vladimir Böhm and Bohumil Böhm |publisher=hermetic.ch|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volny.cz/paib/ |title=Mayan dating, Mayan astronomy, Correlation MD/JD |publisher=volny.cz|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stock.&lt;ref name="baktun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baktun.de/English/english.html |title= Dating the Eclipse Table of the Dresden Codex and the Correlation Problem |author=Anton Stock|publisher=baktun.de|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 and the Long Count==
{{main article|2012 phenomenon}}

According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a book compiling details of [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] known to the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.&lt;ref name="schele1"&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel (1990), pp. 429–30&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the first three creations that the gods failed in making and the creation of the successful fourth world where men were placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous creation ended at the start of a 14th b'ak'tun.

The previous creation ended on a Long Count of 12.19.19.17.19. Another 12.19.19.17.19 occurred on December 20, 2012 (Gregorian Calendar), followed by the start of the 14th b'ak'tun, 13.0.0.0.0, on December 21, 2012.{{#tag:ref|Various sources place this on other dates, notably on December 23.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Friedel (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} There are only two references to the current creation's 13th b'ak'tun in the fragmentary Mayan corpus: [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] Monument 6, part of a ruler's inscription and the recently discovered La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 2, Block V.&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decipherment.wordpress.com/2012/06/30/notes-on-a-new-text-from-la-corona/|title=Notes on a New Text from La Corona « Maya Decipherment|publisher=decipherment.wordpress.com|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya inscriptions occasionally reference future predicted events or commemorations that would occur on dates that lie beyond 2012 (that is, beyond the completion of the 13th ''b'ak'tun'' of the current era). Most of these are in the form of "distance dates" where some Long Count date is given, together with a Distance Number that is to be added to the Long Count date to arrive at this future date.

For example, on the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in [[Palenque]], a section of the text projects into the future to the 80th Calendar Round (CR) 'anniversary' of the famous Palenque ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]'s accession to the throne (Pakal's accession occurred on a Calendar Round date 5 Lamat 1 Mol, at Long Count 9.9.2.4.8 equivalent to 27 July 615 CE in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]).&lt;ref group=n&gt;Gregorian, using GMT correlation JDN=584283.&lt;/ref&gt; It does this by commencing with Pakal's birthdate 9.8.9.13.0{{nbsp|2}}8 Ajaw 13 Pop (24 March {{nowrap|603 CE Gregorian}}) and adding to it the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8.&lt;ref name="Schele 1992, pp.93–95"&gt;Schele (1992, pp. 93–95)&lt;/ref&gt; 

This calculation arrives at the 80th Calendar Round since his accession, a day that also has a CR date of {{nowrap|5 Lamat 1 Mol}}, but which lies over 4,000 years in the future from Pakal's time—the day 21 October in the year 4772. The inscription notes {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} that this day would fall eight days after the completion of the 1st ''piktun'' [since the creation or zero date of the Long Count system], where the ''piktun'' is the next-highest order above the ''b'ak'tun'' in the Long Count. If the completion date of that ''piktun''—13 October 4772—were to be written out in Long Count notation, it could be represented as 1.0.0.0.0.0. The 80th CR anniversary date, eight days later, would be 1.0.0.0.0.8{{nbsp|2}}{{nowrap|5 Lamat 1 Mol}}.&lt;ref name="Schele 1992, pp.93–95"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel (1990, p. 430 ''n.''39)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the publicity generated by the 2012 date, Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name=Milbrath&gt;{{cite news | title=Does Maya calendar predict 2012 apocalypse? | work=USA Today | first=G.

==Converting between the Long Count and western calendars==

===Calculating a western calendar date from a Long Count===

'''It's important to know the difference between the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars when doing these conversions.''' &lt;ref group=n&gt;In 46 BC Julius Caesar adopted the convention of having three years of twelve months of approximately 30 days each to make a year of 365 days and a leap year of 366 days. This made the length of the civil year 365.25 days, close to the length of the solar year of 365.2422 days. This is the [[Julian calendar]]. By 1582 there was an appreciable discrepancy between the [[winter solstice]] and [[Christmas]] and the [[Equinox|spring equinox]] and [[Easter]]. [[Pope Gregory XIII]], with the help of Italian astronomer [[Aloysius Lilius]] ([[Luigi Lilio]]), reformed this system by abolishing the days October 5 through October 14, 1582. This brought the civil and tropical years closer together. He also missed three days every four centuries by decreeing that centuries are only leap years if they are evenly divisible by 400. So for example 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years but 1600 and 2000 are. This is the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Astronomical calculations will return a year zero and years before that are negative numbers. This is astronomical dating. Years before 46 BC are calculated as [[Proleptic Julian calendar|proleptic Julian dates]]. There is no year zero in historical dating. In historical dating the year 1 BC is followed by the year 1
For example, the year −3113 (astronomical dating) is the same as 3114 BC (historical dating). Many books about the Maya and many computer programs to do Maya calendar conversions use the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]] In this calendar all dates before the start of the [[Gregorian calendar]] are revised as if the [[Gregorian calendar]] had been in use before its adoption in October of 1582. Although this system is popular among [[Mayanists]], it is rarely used by anyone else, so for example, dates converted using this system are useless for the study of [[Maya Astronomy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Using as an example the Long Count date of 9.10.11.17.0 (Long Count date mentioned on the Palenque Palace Tablet), first calculate the number of days that have passed since the zero date (August 11, 3114 BC; GMT correlation, in the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]], September 6, −3113 [[Proleptic Julian calendar|Julian]] astronomical).
&lt;center&gt;

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Then add the GMT correlation to the total number of days.

:  1,372,300 + 584,283 = 1,956,583

This number is a '''[[Julian day]]'''.

From this number, subtract the nearest smaller Julian Day Number (in the table below), in this case 1&amp;thinsp;940&amp;thinsp;206, which corresponds to the year 600 AD.

:  1,956,583 – 1,940,206 = 16,377

Next, divide this number by 365 days (vague year).

:  16,377 / 365 = 44.86849

The remainder is 44.86849 years, which is 44 years and 317 days. The full year date is 644 AD. Now calculate the month and day number, taking into account leap days over the 44 years. In the Gregorian Calendar, every fourth year is a leap year with the exception of centuries not evenly divisible by 400 (e.g. 100, 200, 300). When the year is divisible by 400 (e.g. 400, 800, etc.), do not add an extra day. Our calculated year is 644 AD. The number of leap days, keeping in mind that the year 600 is not a leap year, is 10. Subtracting that from 317 remainder days is 307; in other words, the 307th day of the year 644 AD, which is November 3.
To summarize: the Long Count date 9.10.11.17.0 corresponds to November 3, 644 AD, in the ''[[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]]''.

'''To convert a [[Julian day]] to a Julian/Gregorian astronomical date ([[Proleptic Julian calendar]] before 46 BC):'''

Use an astronomical algorithm such as the ''Method of [[Jean Meeus|Meeus]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meeus (1991–2009 with corrections as of August 10, 2009). ''Astronomical Algorithms'' Second Edition Willman-Bell publishers {{ISBN|0-943396-61-1}} Chapter 7 ''Julian Day'' p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; to convert the [[Julian day]] to a Julian/Gregorian date with astronomical dating of negative years:

'''Important''': Astronomical algorithms calculate a day as a decimal number equal to a day and a fraction of a day. The Julian date starts at noon. [[astronomical year numbering|Astronomical]] dating has a year 0. In historical dating the year 1 BCE is followed by the year 1. Astronomical years before 0 are written with a negative sign. For example, the year 3114 BCE is the year −3113 astronomical.

In this Example:

add 0.5 to the Julian day    (1,956,583.5)&lt;br&gt;
calculate Z integer part    (1,956,583)&lt;br&gt;
calculate decimal number F fraction part    (0.5)&lt;br&gt;
if Z &lt; 2,299,161 (Gregorian?)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;integer A = Z&lt;br&gt;
else{&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;integer alpha = floor((Z – 1,867,216.25) / 36,524.25)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (15)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A = Z + 1 + alpha – floor(alpha / 4.0)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (2,436,129)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;br&gt;
calculate integer B = A + 1524    (1,958,107)&lt;br&gt;
calculate integer C = floor((B – 122.1) / 365.25)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;    (5,360)&lt;br&gt;
calculate integer D = floor(365.25 * C)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;    (1,957,740)&lt;br&gt;
calculate integer E = floor((B – D) /30.6001)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;    (11)&lt;br&gt;
decimal number day = B – D – floor(30.6001 * E)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + F    (31.5)&lt;br&gt;
if(E &lt; 14)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; integer month = E – 1    (10)&lt;br&gt;
else&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; month = E – 13&lt;br&gt;
if(month &gt; 2)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; integer year = C – 4,716    (644)&lt;br&gt;
else&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;year = C – 4715

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The floor operation is rounding a decimal number down to the next lowest integer. For example, floor(1.5) = 1 and floor(−1.5) = -2

In this example the ''[[Julian calendar|Julian]]'' date is noon October 31, 644. The Method of [[Jean Meeus|Meeus]] isn't valid for negative [[Julian day number]]s, so another method such as the method of Peter Baum&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140910060704/http://mysite.verizon.net/aesir_research/date/date0.htm&lt;/ref&gt; should be used.

===Calculating a full Long Count date===
[[File:Morley 1915 ISglyphs.svg|thumb|right|160px|[[Chichen Itza]] Initial Series inscription. This date (glyphs A2, B2, …, A5) is 10.2.9.1.9 &amp;nbsp; 9 Muluk 7 Sak, equivalent to July 28, 878 (GMT Gregorian).]]

As stated, a full Long Count date not only includes the five digits of the Long Count, but the 2-character Tzolk'in and the two-character Haab' dates as well. The five digit Long Count can therefore be confirmed with the other four characters (the "calendar round date").

Taking as an example a Calendar Round date of 9.12.2.0.16 (Long Count) 5 Kib' (Tzolk'in) 14 Yaxk'in (Haab'). One can check whether this date is correct by the following calculation.

It is perhaps easier to find out how many days there are since 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk'u and show how the date 5 Kib' 14 Yaxk'in is derived.
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|- align=right
| 9 ||× 144000||= 1296000
|- align=right
| 12 ||× 7200 ||= 86400
|- align=right
| 2 ||× 360 ||= 720
|- align=right
| 0 ||× 20 ||= 0
|- align=right
| 16 ||× 1 ||= 16
|-
| ||Total days||= 1383136
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

===Calculating the Tzolk'in date portion===
The Tzolk'in date is counted forward from 4 Ajaw. To calculate the numerical portion of the Tzolk'in date, add 4 to the total number of days given by the date and then divide total number of days by 13.

: (4 + 1,383,136) / 13 = 106,395 (and 5/13)

This means that 106,395 whole 13-day cycles have been completed and the numerical portion of the Tzolk'in date is 5.

To calculate the day, divide the total number of days in the long count by 20 since there are twenty day names.

:1,383,136 / 20 = 69,156 (and 16/20)

This means 16 day names must be counted from Ajaw. This gives Kib'. Therefore, the Tzolk'in date is 5 Kib'.

===Calculating the Haab' date portion===
The Haab' date 8 Kumk'u is the ninth day of the eighteenth month. There are 17 days to the start of the next year.

Subtract 17 days from the total, to find how many complete Haab' years are contained.

:138,3136 − 17 = 1,383,119

Divide by 365

:1,383,119 / 365 = 3,789 and (134/365)

Therefore, 3,789 complete Haab' have passed and the remainder 134 is the 135th day in the new Haab', since a remainder of 0 would indicate the first day.

Find which month the day is in. Dividing the remainder 134 by 20, is six complete months and a remainder of 14, indicating the 15th day. So, the date in the Haab' lies in the seventh month, which is Yaxk'in. The fifteenth day of Yaxk'in is 14, thus the Haab' date is 14 Yaxk'in.

So the date of the long count date 9.12.2.0.16 5 Kib' 14 Yaxk'in is confirmed.

==Piktuns and higher orders==
There are also four rarely used higher-order periods above the b'ak'tun: ''piktun'', ''kalabtun'', ''k'inchiltun'' and ''alautun''. All of these words are inventions of Mayanists. Each one consists of 20 of the lesser units.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1960 Appendix IV pp. 314, 316, 148–49) "I have throughout assumed that the baktuns were grouped, not in 13's, but in 20's, for the evidence supporting a vigesimal count of baktuns in Dresden and at Palenque and Copan is too strong to be overridden."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grofe, Michael John 2007 The Serpent Series: Precession in the Maya Dresden Codex p. 55 "On occasion, the Maya also recorded intervals of time even greater than 13 B’ak’tuns, such as one Piktun, composed of 20 B’ak’tuns. This is relevant to the current discussion concerning the Serpent Series."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/time-kingship-and-the-maya-universe-maya-calendars/ Martin Time Kingship and the Maya Universe] "…we have clear evidence that the current Bak’tun cycle does not conclude at 13, as the last one did, but advances to 20. In other words, 13.0.0.0.0 will be followed by 14.0.0.0.0, 15.0.0.0.0, and so on to 19.0.0.0.0. A text at the site of Palenque, Mexico, makes this very plain when it records the completion of 1 Piktun, the next unit above the Bak’tun, in 4772 CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many inscriptions give the date of the current creation as a large number of 13s preceding 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ahau 8 Kumk'u. For example, a Late Classic monument from [[Coba]], Stela 1. The date of creation is expressed as 13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0, where the units are 13s in the nineteen places larger than the b'ak'tun.&lt;ref&gt;''Fig. 444'' in Wagner (2006, p. 283)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Freidel (1992, p. 430).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Freidel, L. Schele And J. Parker, Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years On The Shaman's Path, 1993:62, Fig. 2:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="famsi2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.famsi.org/schele_list.php?_allSearch=Coba&amp;hold_search=&amp;tab=schele&amp;title=Schele+Drawing+Collection&amp;x=34&amp;y=12|title=Schele Drawing Collection|publisher=research.famsi.org|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors think that the 13s were symbolic of a completion and don't represent an actual number.&lt;ref name="Lloyd B.

Most inscriptions that use these are in the form of distance dates and Long Reckonings – they give a base date, a distance number that is added or subtracted and the resulting Long Count.

The first example below is from Schele (1987 p.). The second is from Stuart (2005 pp.&amp;nbsp;60, 77)[https://web.archive.org/web/20091117031111/http://www.traditionalhighcultures.org/Distances_across_Era_Date.pdf]

The [[Dresden codex]] contains another method for writing distance numbers. These are Ring Numbers. Specific dates within the [[Dresden codex]] are often given by calculations involving Ring Numbers. [[Ernst Förstemann|Förstemann]]&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann, Ernst Commentary on the Maya Manuscript in the Royal Public Library of Dresden – Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Archaeology and Ethnography, Harvard University Vol. IV. No. 2. pp. 222–64&lt;/ref&gt; identified these, but Wilson (1924:24–25) later clarified the way in which they operate. Ring Numbers are intervals of days between the Era Base date 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk’u and an earlier Ring Base date, where the place-holder for the numeral of days in the interval is circled by an image of a tied red band. Added to this earlier Ring Base date is another count of days forward, which [[J. Eric S. Thompson|Thompson]]&lt;ref&gt;Eric Thompson (1972:20–21)&lt;/ref&gt; refers to as a Long Round, leading to a final date within the Long Count that is given as an entry date to be used within a specific table in the codex.&lt;ref&gt;Grofe, Michael John 2007 The Serpent Series: Precession in the Maya Dresden Codex p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''object language''' is a [[language]] which is the "object" of study in various fields including [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]].  The language being used to talk about an object language is called a [[metalanguage]].  An object language may be a [[formal language|formal]] or [[natural language|natural]] language.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Forms of object language ==
=== Formal languages ===

[[Mathematical logic]] and [[linguistics]] make use of metalanguages, which are languages for describing the nature of other languages. In mathematical logic, the object language is usually a [[formal language]]. The language which a metalanguage is used to describe is the object language. It is called that because that language is the object under discussion using the metalanguage.

For instance, someone who says "In French, you say ''Bonjour'' to greet someone" uses [[English language|English]] as a metalanguage to describe the object language [[French language|French]].

=== Computer languages ===

There are two ways the term ''object language'' can be used in computing: a language which is the object of formal specification, and a language which is the object (goal) of a compiler or interpreter.

==== Formal specification ====

{{Main|Specification language}}

Computer languages are object languages of the metalanguage in which their [[specification]] is written. In computer science this is referred to as the [[specification language]]. [[Backus–Naur form]] was one of the earliest used specification languages.

When [[compiler]]s are written using systems like [[lex (software)|lex]] and [[yacc]], the rules the programmer writes look much like a formal specification, but it is considered an [[implementation]] instead. Many [[programming language implementation]]s are not strictly the same as their specifications, adding features or making implementation-dependent design decisions.

==== Object Code ====

{{Main|Object file}}

At their basic level, computers act on what is given to them through a limited set of instructions which are understood by their [[CPU]]s. In the earliest computers, that meant programmers sometimes composed actual 1's and 0's to program. Since this requires considerable programmer training (and patience) to create instructions, later computer languages have gone to great lengths to simplify the programmer's task. For example, a high level programming language may allow a programmer to assign a value to a variable without specifying a memory location or a CPU instruction.

In this context, the high level programming language is the ''source language'', which is then translated by a [[compiler]] into [[object code]] that the CPU can read directly. This object code is the ''object language'', and varies depending on what CPU is being given the instructions.

''Object language'' in this context means something akin to "the object of what the programmer is trying to achieve". If the source language and object languages are viewed as formal (logical) languages, what the compiler does is ''interpret'' the source into the target language (this is different from the computer science use of ''[[interpreted language]]'' meaning one which is ''not'' compiled).

''Object language'' in this context is synonymous with ''target language''.  The object language of a translation most often is a [[machine language]], but can be some other kind of language, such as [[assembly language]].

Because the object language of compilation has usually been machine language, the term ''[[object file]]'' has come to mean a file containing machine instructions, and sometimes the translated program itself is simply called an ''object''.

''Object language'' should also not be confused with ''[[object-oriented language]]'', which is a type of computer [[programming language]] which changes the programmer's environment into convenient objects which can be used in something similar to a drag-and-drop fashion.

== Expressions in an object language ==
=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Symbol (formal)}}

A ''symbol'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]], [[type-token distinction|token]]s of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Although the term "symbol" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the [[formal language]]s studied in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the term "symbol" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a [[type-token distinction|token]] instance of the symbol.

=== Formulas ===
{{Main|Well-formed formula}}

In the formal languages used in mathematical logic and computer science, a ''well-formed formula'' or simply ''formula'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]] which is expressed using the [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s and [[formation rule]]s (also called the [[formal grammar]]) of a particular formal language. To say that a [[string (computer science)|string]] of symbols &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a well-formed formula with respect to a given formal grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to saying that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the language generated by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Formal systems ===
{{Main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' is a [[formal language]] together with a [[deductive system]] which consists of a set of [[inference rule]]s and/or [[axiom]]s. A formal system is used to [[formal proof|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions previously expressed in the system. These expressions are called [[axiom]]s, in the case of those previously supposed to be true, or [[theorem]]s, in the case of those derived. A formal system may be formulated and studied for its intrinsic properties, or it may be intended as a description (i.e. a [[Interpretation (logic)|model]]) of external phenomena.

=== Theorems ===
{{Main|Theorem}}

A ''theorem'' is a [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] or string of symbols which is [[formal proof|derived]] by using a [[formal system]]. The string of symbols is a [[logical consequence]] of the [[axiom]]s and [[rule of inference|rules]] of the system.

=== Formal proofs ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

A ''formal proof'' or ''derivation'' is a finite sequence of [[proposition]]s (called [[well-formed formula]]s in the case of a [[formal language]]) each of which is an [[axiom]] or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. The last sentence in the sequence is a [[theorem]] of a [[formal system]]. The concept of [[natural deduction]] is a [[generalization]] of the concept of proof.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]], ''deduction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theories ===
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

A ''theory'' is a set of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s in a [[formal language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2111">In [[rhetoric]], '''parechesis''' ({{Lang|grc|παρήχησις}}) is the repetition of the same sound in several words in close succession.&lt;ref&gt;Gert J. C. Jordaan -''Ancient Greek Inside Out: The Semantics of Grammatical Constructions - Guide for Exegetes and Students in Classical and New Testament Greek''  2013- Page 171 3643903537 "NT: 1.27 Parechesis (παρήχησις, likeness ofsound) 0 Definition: Parechesis is repetition of the same sound in successive words. It includes alliteration (repetition of the same consonant) and assonance (repetition of the same vowel).&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of a parechesis is: "He persuades the Pithian ({{Lang|grc|πείθει τὸν Πειθίαν}})."&lt;ref&gt;cf. Xen. ''Hist.'' 7.41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] discusses parechesis in his work ''On the invention of arguments'' (Περὶ εὑρέσεως).&lt;ref&gt;Herm. ''Inv.'' 4.7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alliteration]] (initial rhyme) is a special case of parechesis. 

It is related to [[paronomasia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Greek Historia Monachorum in Aegypto: Monastic Hagiography in ... 0191075817 Andrew Cain - 2016  "Three types of paronomasia are prevalent in the work: same root (verb) but different inflection;16 same root (verb) but different or added prefix;17 and same root but different derivatives.18 Parechesis is identical to paronomasia except that verbal resonance is achieved through the concurrence of words, similar in sound but dissimilar in sense, which are from different roots..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullinger, E. W. ''Figures of Speech Used in the Bible'' 1970  "In these cases, where the Paronomasia is in the Hebrew thought, it is called Parechesis so far as the Greek is concerned. And it is only when we go to the Hebrew thought that we can hear the Hebrew words sounding beside the Greek words."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|platitude}}
A '''platitude''' is a trite, meaningless, or prosaic statement, often used as a [[thought-terminating cliché]], aimed at quelling social, emotional, or cognitive unease.&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;

Platitudes have been criticized as giving a false impression of wisdom, making it easy to accept falsehoods:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A platitude is even worse than a cliché. It’s a sanctimonious cliché, a statement that is not only old and overused but often moralistic and imperious. ... [P]latitudes have an aphoristic quality, they seem like timeless moral lessons. They therefore shape our view of the world, and can lull us into accepting things that are actually false and foolish.&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;Nathan J. Robinson, "The Uses of Platitudes", ''Current Affairs'', August 23, 2017 [https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/08/the-uses-of-platitudes online]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Platitudes often take the form of [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], e.g., "it is what it is", making them appear vacuously true. But the phrase is used to mean "there is no way of changing it", which is no longer a tautology: "Structuring the sentiment as a tautology allows it to appear inescapable."&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;

At the same time, some phrases that have become platitudes may provide useful moral guidance, such as [[Golden Rule|"do unto others as you would have them do unto you"]]. Others, though widely trivialized, may be thought-provoking, such as "Be the change you wish to see in the world".&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;

==Examples==
* Better late than never.
* Every cloud has a silver lining.
* Forgive and forget.
* Go with the flow.
* Good things come to those who wait.
* It is what it is.
* Just be yourself.
* Money can't buy happiness.
* Nice guys finish last.
* No good deed goes unpunished.
* Nobody's perfect.
* Strength is something you choose.
* Such is life.
* This too shall pass.
* Time will tell.
* Tomorrow is another day.
* What's done is done.
* You gotta do what you gotta do.
* [[What does not kill me makes me stronger (disambiguation)|What does not kill me makes me stronger]].

==In philosophy==

In philosophy, platitudes are beliefs or assertions about a topic that are generally accepted as [[common sense]]. In some approaches to [[conceptual analysis]], they are taken as a starting point. Conjoining the platitudes on a topic may give a [[Ramsey sentence]]. Analyzing platitudes is part of the [[Canberra Plan]] of [[philosophical methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Nolan, "Platitudes and metaphysics", in David Braddon-Mitchell &amp; Robert Nola (eds.), ''Conceptual Analysis and Philosophical Naturalism'', MIT Press, 2009 [https://philpapers.org/go.pl?id=NOLPAM&amp;proxyId=none&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fdanielnolanphil.googlepages.com%2FNolanPandM.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word is a borrowing from the French compound ''platitude'', from ''plat'' 'flat' + ''-(i)tude'' '-ness', thus 'flatness'. The figurative sense is first attested in French in 1694 in the meaning 'the quality of banality' and in 1740 in the meaning 'a commonplace remark'. It is first attested in English in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/145403 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''political faction''' is a group of individuals within a larger entity, such as a [[political party]], a [[trade union]] or other group, or simply a [[political climate]], united by a particular common political purpose that differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, "parties within a party," which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organisation.

Factions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.

The Latin word ''factio'' denoted originally either of the chariot teams that were organised professionally by private companies in ancient Rome, each recognisable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans. These teams were not unlike gladiator schools, but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the "team", while the fighters rarely actually teamed up, but rather fought duels or beasts. In time, political currents could become associated with such a team, although precisely how this happened is unclear. In Byzantine Constantinople, two such chariot factions, blue and green, repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne.

Occasionally, the term "faction" is still used more or less as a synonym for political party, but "with opprobrious sense, conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods", according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In his Dictionary, Samuel Johnson (a [[Tory]]) dismissively defined [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] as "the name of a faction". Similarly, in the tenth instalment of The Federalist Papers, [[James Madison]] defines a faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." In plain English this is a group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good.

==Aims of factions==
The aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear. Typically, however, they include: advancing a particular [[policy]] or policy agenda, preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organisation or in the wider political world.  A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group, or a single major aim, with little in the way of common agenda otherwise, or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies.  Either way, factional politics typically revolve around personality, with a few individuals playing key roles, acting as a magnet for like-minded people, leading the activities of the faction, and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction. Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names, such as “powerbrokers” or “factional chiefs”.

==Organisation==
&lt;!--Please DO NOT change the spelling of "organisation" to "organization". See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English]].--&gt;
Factions differ in the amount of organisation and internal structure they possess. On the left, these may take the form of tendencies or [[platform (European politics)|platforms]]. Most factions are very loose organisations, having no definitive list of members, but some factions, have a formal internal structure, with membership lists, regular meetings, official positions – such as negotiators, conveners, [[whip (politics)|whips]] and organisers, – and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organisation. Such factions will typically be binding; that is, they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre-ordained official stance of the faction.

==Operation of factions==
In political organisations that are [[democracy|democratic]] in structure, factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots. This process is sometimes referred to as “doing the numbers”. Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation.

If one faction develops within an organisation, there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it. Opposing factions will try to match each other's level of organisation and internal discipline, but will also engage in negotiations and trade-offs to ensure that the organisation’s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals.

Key to the operation of an organised faction is the existence of a power base. This will typically be some office, division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control. Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organisation that is involved with the broader organisation in some way.

A power base serves several key functions:
* It acts as a recruitment centre for new members, and promotes homogeneity within the membership (crucial for maintaining factional cohesion);
* It can be used as an organising centre for factional events and activities;
* It functions as a springboard, advancing the career of selected factional members and allowing them to gain skills that will increase their effectiveness and clout.

==Effects of factions==
The existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation.  If factional strife becomes intensive and public, the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity. Taken one step further, if the conflict is particularly severe, it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness, leading to break-up or collapse of the organisation.

To avoid harm to the organisation, factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny. This, however, can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour. Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box-stuffing, stack-outs, membership fraud, and other generally fraudulent conduct. Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal [[Feud|vendettas]] where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers.  A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation.

Despite this, the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked. It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism. This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife, when in fact, factions are often able to engage in productive co-operation.

In any political organisation there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people. The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable. Compromise and give-and-take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different, uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split. So, somewhat counter-intuitively, factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony.

Factions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation’s appeal. A person who might otherwise find the organisation’s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own. Just as a democratic [[government]] is often invigorated by a strong [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]], so having a number of distinct points-of-view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively. It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose, so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre-existing differences within the organisation.

The Founding Fathers of the American constitution, explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism. Madison, Hamilton, and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government. These sentiments can be found in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison.

The '''problem play''' is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the arts, especially following the innovations of [[Henrik Ibsen]]. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context.&lt;ref name="Problem plays"&gt;[http://www.theatrelinks.com/problem-play/ Problem Play - ''Theatre Links'']&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Chris Baldick]] writes that the genre emerged "from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen's realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts." He summarises it as follows:

{{quote|Rejecting the frivolity of intricately plotted romantic intrigues in the nineteenth-century French tradition of the '[[well-made play]]', it favoured instead the form of the 'problem play', which would bring to life some contemporary controversy of public importance—women's rights, unemployment, penal reform, class privilege—in a vivid but responsibly accurate presentation.&lt;ref name = "cris"&gt;Chris Baldick, ''The Modern Movement: 1910-1940'', Oxford University Press, Oxford,  2004, p.116; 367&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The critic [[F. S. Boas]] adapted the term to characterise [[Shakespeare's problem plays|certain plays]] by [[William Shakespeare]] that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen's 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] dramas that do not fit easily into the classical [[Genre|generic]] distinction between [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]].&lt;ref name="Problem plays" /&gt;

==Early "problem plays"==
While plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and [[satyr play]]s, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as [[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]].

==Shakespeare==
{{main|Shakespearean problem play}} 
[[F. S. Boas]] used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare's play, which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements. For Boas the 'problem' plays were ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''. He wrote that "throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome".&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Boas, ''Shakespeare and his Predecessors'', John Murray, Third Impression, 1910, pp. 344–408.&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics have used the term for other plays, including ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.

==19th-century drama==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-1118-005, Berlin, "Gespenster".jpg|thumb|left|A performance of Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', one of the defining Problem plays,  in Berlin, 1983.]]
While social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], who dealt with the subject of [[prostitution]] in ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'' (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day, "No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Dickinson, ''An Outline of Contemporary Drama'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1927, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer [[Henrik Ibsen]], whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women's lives in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1882) and provincial greed in ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882). Ibsen's dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and other later dramatists.

==20th century==
The genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton's ''[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]'' (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the 'problem'. This "resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle" starts with the 'problem' of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected her status as a victim of seduction "the 'problem' is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden's tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman's future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment."&lt;ref name = "cris"/&gt;

In America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as [[Angelina Weld Grimké]]'s, ''Rachel''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fehrenbach, "An Early Twentieth-Century Problem Play of Life in Black America: Angelina Grimké's ''Rachel''," in ''Wild Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary Literary Renaissance'', ed. Joanne M. Braxton and Andree Nicola McLaughlin ( New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1990), pp. 89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede's ''Paragraph 218'' (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by [[Erwin Piscator]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fisher Dawson, ''Documentary Theatre in the United States: An Historical Survey and Analysis of Its Content, Form, and Stagecraft'', Greenwood Press, Westport, CT., 1999, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mikhail bakhtin.jpg|thumb|[[Mikhail Bakhtin]], author of ''Rabelais and His World'', pictured in 1920]]
'''''Rabelais and His World''''' (Russian: Творчество Франсуа Рабле и народная культура средневековья и Ренессанса, ''Tvorčestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaja kul'tura srednevekov'ja i Renessansa''; 1965) is a scholarly work which is considered one of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s most important texts and now a classic of [[Renaissance]] studies. In the work Bakhtin explores ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' by the French Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin argues that for centuries Rabelais’s book has been misunderstood. Bakhtin attempts to redress this and clarify Rabelais's intentions through two methods: recovery of sections of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' that were previously either ignored or suppressed, and analysis of the [[Renaissance]] social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and ''[[grotesque body|grotesque realism]],'' which is defined as a literary mode.  

Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 297-299&lt;/ref&gt; As written, ''Rabelais and His World'' not only examines the openness of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', it also serves as an example of such openness.

==History of the text==
Bakhtin completed his book on Rabelais (titled ''Rabelais in the History of Realism'') in 1940. After several attempts to get the book published fell through, it was submitted as a dissertation for the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree at the [[Gorky Institute of World Literature]] in Moscow. At the dissertation's defense in 1946, all three official opponents were in favor of awarding Bakhtin a [[Higher doctorate|higher doctoral degree]]: the [[Doctor of Sciences]], and their motion was accepted with a narrow majority vote. However, following an assault on the institute published in the press at the time, and after six years of repeated revisions and deliberations, USSR's [[Higher Attestation Commission|VAK]] decided Bakhtin would only receive the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree&lt;ref&gt;See commentary to vol. 4 of Bakhtin's Collected Writings (''Sobranie sochinenii'', Moscow: Russkie Slovari, 2008–2010)&lt;/ref&gt; (roughly equivalent to a [[research doctorate]]). The book was eventually published in Russian in 1965, under the title ''Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance''. Its 1968 English translation by Hélène Iswolsky was given the title, ''Rabelais and His World''.

==Carnival==
{{Main article|Carnivalesque}}
For Bakhtin, ''carnival'' is associated with the collectivity. Those attending a carnival do not merely constitute a crowd; rather the people are seen as a
whole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist 302"&gt;Clark and Holquist 302&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, “[A]ll were considered equal during carnival.  Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age”.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 10&lt;/ref&gt; The carnival atmosphere holds the lower strata of life most important, as opposed to higher functions (thought, speech, soul) which were usually held dear in the signifying order. At carnival time, the unique sense of time and space causes individuals to feel they are a part of the collectivity, at which point they cease to be themselves.  It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed.  At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one’s sensual, material, bodily unity and community.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist 302"/&gt;

==Grotesque==

{{Main article|Grotesque body}}

Bakhtin’s notion of ''carnival'' is connected with that of the ''grotesque''. In the carnival, usual social hierarchies and proprieties are upended; emphasis is placed on the body in its open dimension, in its connection to the life of the community. This emphasis on the material dimension which links humans, rather than on the differences and separations between them, allows for the consciousness of the historical dimension of human life: for every death, there is a birth, a renewal of the human spirit. This process allows for progress.&lt;br&gt;
In the grotesque body, emphasis is placed on the open, the penetrative, and the "lower stratum." The open (the mouth, the anus, the vagina, etc.) and the penetrative (the nose, the penis, etc.) allow exchange between the body and the world (mostly through sex, eating, and drinking), but also to produce degrading material (curses, urine, feces, etc.). The lower stratum (belly, womb, etc.) is the place where renewal happens, where new life is forged, thus connecting degradation to renewal. The grotesque body is one of excess, rebellious to authority and austerity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail|title=Rabelais and His World|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=9780253348302|pages=303–436}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Due to its inscription in time and its emphasis on bodily changes (through [[eating]], [[Defecation|evacuation]], and [[sex]]), the ''grotesque'' has been interpreted by some critics as a dimension of the body that permits to perceive the historicity of man: it is in this reading used as a measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of laughter==
Bakhtin opens this work with a quotation from [[Alexander Herzen]]: "It would be extremely interesting to write the history of laughter".&lt;ref&gt;chap.1, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary expressions of the [[ancient world]]'s conceptions of laughter is the text that survives in the form of apocryphal letters of  [[Hippocrates]] about [[Democritus]] ([[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''Epistles'' 10–21).&lt;ref name="p.66-67"&gt;p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt; The laughter of Democritus had a philosophical character, being directed at the life of man and at all the vain fears and hopes related to the gods and to life after death. Democritus here made of his laughter a complete conception of the world, a certain spiritual premise of the man who has attained maturity and has awakened. Hippocrates finally perfectly agreed with him.&lt;ref name="p.66-67"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5799">'''Rich Donovan''' is a global expert in business development issues surrounding disability and accessibility. He is best known for creating financial instruments that track the intersection of corporate profitability with corporate commitment to disability hiring and best practices. His Return On Disability Index is reported on Bloomberg and has been used as the basis of an Exchange Traded Note (ETN) by [[Barclay’s Bank]] on the [[NYSE Arca]] Stock Exchange.

==Accessibility and Finance Work==

===Development of the Return on Disability Index===

Rich Donovan is a founder of several research and advisory companies that have foregrounded the business case for companies and governments to act on the disability market. In 2008, he founded what is now called '''The Return on Disability Group''' to build metric and models that allow for analysis of corporate activity which help assess how well businesses engage customers and employees with disabilities. The organization’s "Return on Disability Reports" and other models helps companies understand their performance across disability factors that are linked directly to profitability. As well they produce the Return on Disability Indices for the U.S. and Canada markets. These financial tools "recognize public companies that are outperforming in the disability market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rod-group.com/rod-report/companies |title=The RoD Report |publisher=The Return on Disability Group |access-date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RoD US 100 and the RoD Canada 50, are published daily by Bloomberg LP. The indices track the shares of the 100 firms that deal best with disabled people. The Economist notes that in the five years to 2012 the US index had outperformed the broader stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=September 8, 2012|title=Disability and business: The new green |publisher=[[The Economist]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LIME===
In 2006, Rich Donovan founded Lime Connect.   Lime Connect is an organization whose goal is to find employment for people with disabilities.   The idea with Lime Connect is: “to connect with the brightest people with disabilities from all disciplines. Results have been stellar, with the Lime Connect Fellowship Program placing 20 young stars in 2011 alone, six of whom were hired by Google.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essentialaccessibility.com/newsletter/march/feature.html |title=Disability: From Redheaded Stepchild to Golden Girl |publisher=Essential Accessibility |first1=Rich|last1=Donovan|access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies Lime has partnered with include PepsiCo, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, IBM, and TD Bank.&lt;ref name =Carleton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=2014 |title=Rich Donovan |work=Accessibility Summit: Speaker List |publisher=[[Carleton University]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental Concepts===

As one of the early progenitors of the business case for accessibility, Donovan has focused on the following:

* Strategic road maps for companies to do accessibility well. What works within their strategic frameworks.
* What accessibility practices drive value at specific companies that, in turn, drive investor returns
* the notion of Shared value so that the next ten years of growth will come from non-traditional markets such as people with disabilities

==Personal Life and Professional Development==

===Education===

Donovan received his BBA in Finance from the Schulich School of Business at York University (1993 - 1997) and his MBA from Columbia Business School (2000 – 2002). He worked successfully as a trader for Merrill Lynch. Donovan is an avid sailor and father of a son, Maverick, along with his wife, Jenn. He has cerebral palsy.&lt;ref name=Carleton/&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
'''Sexual violence by intimate partners''' deals with the incidence by country of [[physical abuse]], forced sex, or [[marital rape]] within the context of domestic violence. 

==Domestic violence and sexual abuse==
Domestic [[sexual violence]], such as forced sex or marital rape, may follow or be part of physical abuse, but is not always the case. In [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], studies estimate that 40–52% of women experiencing physical violence by an intimate partner have also been sexually coerced by that partner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell JC, Soeken KL. Forced sex and intimate partner violence: effects on women’s risk and women’s health. Violence Against Women, 1999, 5:1017–1035.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granados Shiroma M.Salud reproductiva y violencia contra la mujer: un ana lisis desde la perspectiva de género. [Reproductive health and violence against women: an analysis from the gender perspective of Nuevo Leon, Asociación Mexicana de Población, Colegio de México, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sexual violence may occur without physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hakimi M et al. Silence for the sake of harmony: domestic violence and women’s health in central Java. Yogyakarta, Gadjah Mada University, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], in a representative sample of over 6000 men, 7% reported having sexually and physically abused their wives, 22% reported using sexual violence without physical violence and 17% reported that they had used physical violence alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin SL et al. Sexual behaviour and reproductive health outcomes: associations with wife abuse in India. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1999, 282:1967–1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence by country==
Studies indicate that sexual assault by an intimate partner is neither rare nor unique to any particular region of the world. For instance, 23% of women in North [[London]], [[England]], reported having been the victim of either an attempted or completed rape by a partner in their lifetime. Similar figures have been reported for [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (23.0%), [[León, Nicaragua]], (21.7%), [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (22.5%), and for the [[Midlands Province]] in [[Zimbabwe]] (25.0%). The prevalence of women sexually assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetime (including attempted assaults) has also been estimated in a few national surveys (for example, [[Canada]] 8.0%, [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] (combined) 14.2%, [[Finland]] 5.9%, [[Switzerland]] 11.6% and the [[United States]] 7.7%).

The table below summarizes some available data on the prevalence of sexual coercion by intimate partners.

'''Street theatre''' is a form of [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] and presentation in outdoor [[public space]]s without a specific paying audience. These spaces can be anywhere, including [[Shopping mall|shopping centres]], [[Parking lot|car parks]], recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. The actors who perform street theatre range from [[busking|busker]]s to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance spaces, or to promote their mainstream work. It was a source of providing information to people when there were no sources of providing information like television, radio etc. Nowadays, street play is used to convey a message to the crowd watching it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2011/08/street-plays-a-means-of-spreading-awareness/&lt;/ref&gt; Street play is considered to be the rawest form of acting, because one does not have a microphone or loud speakers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Sometimes performers are commissioned, especially for street [[festival]]s, children's shows or [[parade]]s, but more often street theatre performers are unpaid or gather some income through the dropping of a coin in a hat by the audience.

The logistics of doing street theatre necessitate simple [[costume]]s and [[Theatrical property|prop]]s, and often there is little or no [[Electronic amplifier|amplification]] of sound, with actors depending on their natural [[human voice|vocal]] and physical ability. This issue with sound has meant that [[physical theatre]], including dance, [[mime artist|mime]] and [[slapstick]], is a very popular genre in an outdoor setting. The performances need to be highly visible, loud and simple to follow in order to attract a crowd.

Street theatre should be distinguished from other more formal outdoor theatrical performances, such as performances in a park or garden, where there is a discrete space set aside (or [[rope]]d off) and a [[Ticket (admission)|ticketed]] audience.

In some cases, street theatre performers have to get a [[licence]] or specific permission through [[local government|local]] or [[State (subnational)|state]] [[government]]s in order to perform. Many performers travel internationally&lt;ref&gt;[http://performers.net/ International list of performers]&lt;/ref&gt; to certain locations of note.

Street theatre is arguably the oldest form of theatre in existence: most mainstream entertainment mediums can be traced back to origins in street performing, including religious [[passion plays]] and many other forms. More recently performers who, a hundred years ago, would have made their living working in [[variety theatre]]s, [[music hall]]s and in [[vaudeville]], now often perform professionally in the many well-known street performance areas throughout the world. Notable performers that began their careers as street theatre performers include [[Robin Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;Robin Williams began his career on the streets of San Francisco as a street performer: https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800013042/bio&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bowie]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] and [[Harry Anderson]].

Street theatre allows people who might not have ever been to, or been able to afford to go to, traditional theatre. The audience is made up of anyone and everyone who wants to watch and for most performances is free entertainment.

==Reasons for staging work on the street==

Performance artists with an interest in social activism may choose to stage their work on the street as a means of directly confronting or engaging the public. For example, multimedia artist Caeser Pink and his group of performers known as The Imperial Orgy staged a piece titled ''Our Daily Bread''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/CaeserPinkOurDailyBread-OrgyStreetTheateronWallStreet Archive Video]&lt;/ref&gt; that brought performers onto the streets of the New York's financial district to ceremoniously lay loaves of [[Wonder Bread]] along the sidewalks, each with an advertisement from Satan offering to buy people's souls in exchange for material possessions. The performance caused an uproar when police were called out and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to inspect the loaves of bread for explosives.

Other artists consider a paying, theatre-going public to be unrepresentative of the public to whom they are trying to communicate, and performing to 'the man on the street' may be considered a more democratic form of dissemination.

Some contemporary street theatre practitioners have extensively studied pre-existing street and popular theatre traditions, such as [[Carnival]], [[commedia dell'arte]] etc. and wish to present them in a situation close to their original context.

Whatever the reason for choosing the street, the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of [[Welfare State International]] argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor is it simply taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last = Coult | editor-first = Tony | editor2-last = Kershaw | editor2-first = Baz | title = Engineers of the Imagination: The Welfare State Handbook | publisher = Methuen | year = 1983 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oPkCAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;dq=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;pgis=1 | isbn = 0-413-52800-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSI India street play.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A street play (''nukkad natak'') in [[Dharavi]] slums in Mumbai]].
Many companies are politically motivated and use street theatre to combine performance with protest. This has occurred through the [[guerrilla theatre]] of [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doyle | first = Michael William | title = Imagine Nation: The American Counterculture of the '60s and '70s | publisher = Routeledge | year = 2001 | url = http://www.diggers.org/guerrilla_theater.htm | isbn = 0-415-93040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Living Theatre]], the carnivalesque parades of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], and the work of [[Ashesh Malla]] and the Sarwanam Theatre Group of [[Nepal]].

A character-based street theatre which developed in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull Puncture Repair Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a ''[[Candid Camera]]'' way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.

Another example would be Natural Theatre's Pink Suitcase scenario. A number of smartly dressed people carrying bright pink suitcases enter a set of streets or buildings. They search for and miss their companions. In their search they get on buses, hail cabs, end up in shop windows, etc. By the time they meet up at a pre-arranged spot with the help of passers-by, perceptions of the area have changed and shopping has ceased for at least a few moments. The humour is universal and this piece has been seen in nearly seventy countries. It is usually performed by four or five actors, but has been done with twenty-five.

In [[comedy]], a '''throwaway line''' (also: '''throwaway joke''' or '''throwaway gag''') is a [[joke]] delivered "in passing" without being the [[punch line]] to a [[comedy routine]], part of the [[wikt:buildup|build up]] to another joke, or (in the context of [[drama]]) there to advance a story or develop a character. Throwaway lines are often [[one-liner joke|one-liner]]s, or [[in-joke]]s, and often delivered in a [[deadpan]] manner.

In [[comic strip]]s ([[Sunday comics]] in particular) throwaway gags are often placed in the throwaway panels of the comic, and are located there so that removing the throwaway panels for space reasons will not destroy the narrative of the central comic.

In [[episodic fiction]], a line intended originally as a throwaway line in one episode may later be [[retconned]] by being incorporated into the [[back-story]] of the main drama, and used to develop the longer-term plot.

[[File:kriegerhall.jpg|thumb|[[Murray Krieger]] Hall in the School of Humanities, an example of the [[Brutalist]] architecture of the UC Irvine campus.]]
The '''School of Humanities''' is one of the [[Faculty (division)|academic units]] of the [[University of California, Irvine]]. 
Upon the school's opening in 1965, the '''Division of Humanities''' was one of the five liberal arts divisions that the campus had to offer. Samuel McCulloch was appointed as UC Irvine's founding dean of Humanities 1953.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;https://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/history.php&lt;/ref&gt; The School hosts the [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]]&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; and the [[University of California Humanities Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;http://uchri.org/uchri/about-uchri/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The division of humanities is one of the five liberal arts divisions that opened with the campus in 1965. In 1963, Samuel McCulloch was appointed as the founding dean of UC Irvine Division of Humanities and laid its foundation. Upon the campus' opening day, he created four departments within the divion with a total of thirty-one faculty members. The four departments were: English and Comparative Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, History, and Philosophy. By 1967, the governing body of UC Irvine turned the five liberal arts divisions into individual schools and the Division of Humanities had become the School of Humanities. In 1970 the Humanities Core Course was implemented and there was a focus on strengthening existing Humanities departments for the rest of the 1970s. The school also launched a doctorate in Critical Theory, making UC Irvine to be the only university in the country to offer a doctorate in the field.
In the 1980s, Dean Ken Bailes founded the Organized Research Unit in Critical Theory and brought the system wide University of California Humanities Research Institute to UC Irvine. The School of Humanities started gaining national recognition and it expanded and grew throughout the 1990s and 2000s. The Humanities Instructional Building and Humanities Gateway were built and completed the Humanities Quad. The school today continues to expand by adding special programs and by creating cross collaboration with different schools on campus. The school has a total of 13 departments and over 20 majors and several interdisciplinary programs.

In the countable sense, a '''verse''' is formally a single [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] [[Line (poetry)|line]] in a [[poetry|poetic composition]]. However, verse has come to represent any division or grouping of words in a poetic composition, with groupings traditionally having been referred to as [[stanza]]s.

In the uncountable ([[mass noun]]) sense '''verse''' refers to  "[[poetry]]" as contrasted to [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wiktionary'', "Verse" (accessed 8 August 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the common unit of verse is based on [[meter (poetry)|meter]] or [[rhyme]], the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.types-of-poetry.org.uk/45-verse.htm "Verse"], "Types-Of-Poetry", Screen 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense '''verse''' is also used pejoratively in contrast to [[poetry]] to suggest work that is too pedestrian or too incompetent to be classed as poetry.

==Types of verse==
===Blank verse===
[[Blank verse]] is poetry written in regular, metrical, but unrhymed, lines, almost always composed of iambic pentameters.
&lt;poem&gt;
    Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit
    Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
    Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of Eden, 'till one greater Man
    ....
                                              —[[John Milton]] (from [[Paradise Lost]])
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Free verse===
[[Free verse]] is usually defined as having no fixed meter and no end rhyme. Although free verse may include end rhyme, it commonly does not.
&lt;poem&gt;
    Whirl up, sea—
    Whirl your pointed pines,
    Splash your great pines
    On our rocks,
    Hurl your green over us,
    Cover us with your pools of fir.

                                              —[[H.D.]]

'''Women in government''' in the modern era are under-represented in most countries worldwide. Women have inadequate opportunities in social participation, especially in striving for political rights and power in the government and different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Namibia|first=Sister|last2=Windhoek|date=1989|title=Women in government|url=https://search-proquest-com.easyaccess1.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/docview/194900864/fulltext/15F1461D90D946E1PQ/1?accountid=10371|journal=1(3)|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social status of women is relatively poor compared to men in different countries around the world, that contributes to generating the atmosphere of inferiority of women in the society.

However more and more women are pursuing leadership positions in the present day.

Increasing women's representation in the government can empower women&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;Two chapters:

Women, as the conventional primary caretakers of children, often have a more prominent role than men in advocating for children, resulting in a "double dividend" in terms of the benefits of women's representation.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Female representatives not only advance women's rights, but also advance the rights of children. In national legislatures, there is a notable trend of women advancing gender and family-friendly legislation. This advocacy has been seen in countries ranging from [[France]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Netherlands]], to [[South Africa]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Egypt]]. Furthermore, a number of studies from both industrialized and developed countries indicate that women in local government tend to advance social issues.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; In India, for instance, greater women's representation has corresponded with a more equitable distribution of community resources, including more gender-sensitive spending on programs related to health, nutrition, and education.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 1954, the [[United Nations]] ''[[Convention on the Political Rights of Women]]'' went into force, enshrining women's equal rights to vote, hold office, and access public services as provided for male citizens within national laws.

== Worldwide status of women's representation in government ==
[[File:Prof. Dr. Lala Shevket, Leader of Azerbaijan Liberal Party.jpg|thumb|World's first female [[Secretary of State]] [[Lala Shevket]] at the office of [[Azerbaijan Liberal Party]]]]
As of October 25, 2013, the global average of women in national assemblies is 21.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women in Parliaments: World and Regional Averages | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, large differences exist between countries, e.g. Sri Lanka has quite low female participation rates in parliament compared with Denmark, Sweden and Norway, where female representation rates are among the highest.&lt;ref name="Carmichael" /&gt; Four of the top ten countries in 2017 were in South America (Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Mexico), and the Americas have seen the greatest aggregate change over the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apolitical.co/solution_article/which-countries-have-most-women-in-parliament/|title=Mapped: which countries have the most women in parliament|work=Apolitical|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New figures are available for up to February 2014 from International IDEA, Stockholm University and Inter-Parliamentary Union. (2014) at http://www.quotaproject.org/quotas.cfm

Although over 60% of countries have reached at least 10% women in their national legislature, far fewer have crossed the 20% and 30% barriers. By February 2006, only about 10% of sovereign nations had more than 30% women in [[parliament]].&lt;ref name="Paxton"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paxton | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Melanie M. | last3 = Kunovich | first3 = Sheri L. | title = Gender in politics | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 263–284 | publisher = [[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131651 | date = August 2007 | url = https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131651 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major English-speaking democracies are placed mostly in the top 40% of the ranked countries. New Zealand ranks at position 27 with women comprising 32.2% of its parliament. Australia (24.7% in the lower house, 38.2% in the upper house) and Canada (24.7% lower house, 37.9% upper house) rank at position 46 out of 189 countries. The United Kingdom is ranked at 58 (22.5% lower house, 22.6% upper house), while the United States ranks 78 (17.8% in the lower house, 20.0% in the upper house).&lt;ref name="Inter-Parliamentary Union" /&gt; It should be noted that not all of these lower and/or upper houses in national parliaments are democratically elected; for example, in Canada members of the upper house (the Senate) are appointed.

Paxton describes three factors that are the basis for why national level representation has become much larger over the past several decades. The first is the changing structural and economic conditions of nations, which says that educational advancements along with an increase in women's participation in the labor force encourages representation.&lt;ref name="Kunovich"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paxton | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Kunovich | first2 = Sheri L. | title = Pathways to power: the role of political parties in women's national political representation | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 505–552 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press|Chicago Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/444445 | jstor = 10.1086/ajs.2005.111.issue-2 | date = September 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/444445 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is the political factor; representation of women in office being based on a proportionality system. Some voting systems are built so that a party that gains 25% of the votes gains 25% of the seats. In these processes, a political party feels obligated to balance the representation within their votes between genders, increasing women's activity in political standing. A [[Plurality voting system|plurality-majority system]], such as the one the United States, United Kingdom, and India has, only allows single candidate elections, and thus allows political parties to entirely dictate regions' representatives even if they only control a small majority of the vote. Last, there is the ideological disposition of a country; the concept that the cultural aspects of women's roles or positions in the places they live dictate where they stand in that society, ultimately either helping or handicapping those women from entering political positions.&lt;ref name="Kunovich" /&gt;

==Pathways to political involvement==

Globally, there have been 4 general pathways that have lead women into political office:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Henderson |first1=Sarah L. |last2=Jeydel |first2=Alana S. |title=Women and Politics in a Global World |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0199899665 |pages=20–21 |chapter=1. Women and International Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Political family - women in this path come from families that have a long history of in involvement in electoral politics.
* Surrogate - women in this path have assumed office, often temporarily, as a surrogate for a father, husband, or brother who has recently died.
* Party or political insider – women in this path start at the bottom of a party or political ladder and work their way up over time filling in necessary roles to show loyalty to the party.
* Political outsider – women in this path usually lack political experience but they run on a platform emphasizing new political changes and serve as an alternative to the status quo.

==Challenges faced by women==
Women face numerous obstacles in achieving representation in governance.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

=== Societal challenges ===
Gender inequality within families, inequitable [[division of labor]] within households, and cultural attitudes about [[gender roles]] further subjugate women and serve to limit their representation in public life.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;  Societies that are highly [[patriarchal]] often have local power structures that make it difficult for women to combat.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"&gt;{{citation | last = UNRISD | author-link = United Nations Research Institute for Social Development | contribution = Overview | editor-last = UNRISD | editor-link = United Nations Research Institute for Social Development | title = Gender equality: striving for justice in an unequal world | page = xxi | publisher = [[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789290850731 | url = http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/search/1FF4AC64C1894EAAC1256FA3005E7201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, their interests are often not represented or under-represented.

=== Systematic challenges ===
There have been many arguments saying the plurality-majority voting system is a disadvantage to the chance that women get into office. [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] brings forth one of these arguments by stating: "Plurality-majority single-member-district systems, whether of the Anglo-American [[first-past-the-post]] (FPTP) variety, the Australian preference ballot [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] (AV), or the French [[two-round system]] (TRS), are deemed to be particularly unfavorable to women's chances of being elected to office".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt; [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew]] believes that the best systems are [[List proportional representation|list-proportional systems]]. "In these systems of high proportionality between seats won and votes cast, small parties are able to gain representation and parties have an incentive to broaden their overall electoral appeal by making their candidate lists as diverse as possible".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

Even once elected, women tend to hold lesser valued cabinet ministries or similar positions.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003" /&gt; These are sometimes described as "soft industries" and include health, education, and welfare.  Far less often do women hold executive decision-making authority in more powerful domains or those that are associated with traditional notions of masculinity (such as finance and the military).  Typically, the more powerful the institution, the less likely it is that women's interests will be represented.  Additionally, in more autocratic nations, women are less likely to have their interests represented.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005" /&gt; Many women attain political standing due to kinship ties, as they have male family members who are involved in politics.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003" /&gt; These women tend to be from higher income, higher status families and thus may not be as focused on the issues faced by lower income families. In The United States, the lower end of the professional ladder contains a higher proportion of women while the upper level contains a higher proportion of men. Research shows that women are underrepresented in head positions in state agencies making up only 18% of congress and 15% of corporate board positions. When women do gain any level of representation it is in the fields of health, welfare, and labor. They are seen to be addressing issues labeled as feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Amy E.|last2=Monaghan|first2=Karen R.|date=2013-01-01|title=Some Ceilings Have More Cracks: Representative Bureaucracy in Federal Regulatory Agencies|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0275074011420997|journal=The American Review of Public Administration|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=50–71|doi=10.1177/0275074011420997|issn=0275-0740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges of personal life and choices ===
Additionally, women running for public office typically gain additional, unnecessary scrutiny on their private lives.  For instance, fashion choices of politically active women are often picked apart by the media. In these "analyses" women rarely gain approval from those in the media, who usually say they either they show too much skin or too little, or perhaps that they either look too feminine or too masculine.  Sylvia Bashevkin also notes that their romantic lives are often subject of much interest to the general population, perhaps more so than their political agenda or stances on issues.&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 86–89"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Vexatious Vixens | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|pages=86–89 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She points out that those who "appear to be sexually active outside a monogamous heterosexual marriage run into particular difficulties, since they tend to be portrayed as vexatious vixens"&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 88"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Vexatious Vixens | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|page=88 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are more interested in their private romantic lives than in their public responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 86–89"/&gt;  If they are in a monogamous, married relationship but have children, then their fitness for office becomes a question of how they manage being a politician while taking care of their children, something that a male politician would rarely, if ever, be asked about.

A 2017 study found that female Republican candidates fare worse in elections than Republican men and Democratic women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bucchianeri|first=Peter|date=2017-05-22|title=Is Running Enough?

===Challenges within political parties===
In Canada, there is evidence that female politicians face gender stigma from male members of the political parties to which they belong which can undermine the ability of women to reach or maintain leadership roles. [[Pauline Marois]], leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ) and the official opposition of the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], was the subject of a claim by Claude Pinard, a PQ "[[backbencher]]", that many Quebecers do not support a female politician: "I believe that one of her serious handicaps is the fact she's a woman [...] I sincerely believe that a good segment of the population won't support her because she's a woman".&lt;ref name="Banerjee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Banerjee|first=Sidhartha|title=PQ woes prompt debate in Quebec about whether women get a fair deal in politics|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/pq-woes-prompt-debate-in-quebec-about-whether-women-get-a-fair-deal-in-politics-1.720302|accessdate=November 2, 2011|work=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2000 study that analyzed 1993 election results in Canada found that among "similarly situated women and men candidates", women actually had a small vote advantage. The study showed that neither voter turnout nor urban/rural constituencies were factors that help or hurt a female candidate, but "office-holding experience in non-political organizations made a modest contribution to women's electoral advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Erickson | first2 = Lynda | title = Women candidates and voter bias: do women politicians need to be better? | journal = [[Electoral Studies]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–100 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/S0261-3794(01)00028-2 | date = March 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/S0261-3794(01)00028-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce M. Hicks, an electoral studies researcher at Université de Montréal, states that evidence shows that female candidates begin with a head start in voters' eyes of as much as 10 per cent, and that female candidates are often more favorably associated by voters with issues like health care and education.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt; The electorate's perception that female candidates have more proficiency with traditional women's spheres such as education and health care presents a possibility that gender stereotypes can work in a female candidate's favor, at least among the electorate. In politics, however, Hicks points out that sexism is nothing new:
{{blockquote|(Marois' issue) does reflect what has been going on for some time now: women in positions of authority have problems in terms of the way they manage authority [...] The problem isn't them, it's the men under them who resent taking direction from strong women. And the backroom dirty dialogue can come into the public eye.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt;}}

Within Quebec itself, Don McPherson pointed out that Pinard himself has enjoyed greater electoral success with Pauline Marois as party leader than under a previous male party leader, when Pinard failed to be elected in his riding. Demographically, Pinard's electoral riding is rural, with "relatively older, less-well educated voters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McPherson|first=Don|title=Pauline Marois's troubles aren't because of sexism| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120107020557/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Pauline+Marois+troubles+aren+because+sexism/5648719/story.html | archive-date = January 7, 2012|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Pauline+Marois+troubles+aren+because+sexism/5648719/story.html|accessdate=November 13, 2011|work=[[Montreal Gazette]] | location = Canada|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's suffrage movement==
[[File:Suffragette_parade._Grand_Marshall,_Mrs._Richard_Burleson;_Herald,_Miss_Inez_Milholland.jpg|thumb|left|Suffragette demonstration, 1913, Washington, D.C.]]
{{Main|Women's suffrage movement}}
[[Women's suffrage]] is the right of women to vote in elections. Most countries enacted women's suffrage in the first half of the 20th century. New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. On the 19th of September in 1893, New Zealand became the first country that allowed women the right to participate in elections. The change in the law was a result of a petition headed by Kate Shepherd on behalf of the Women's Temperance Union. The petition was signed by 32000 women, almost one in four of New Zealand women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/voting-rights/page-4|title=4.  – Voting rights – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the last countries to enact it were [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. In Switzerland, women gained the [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|right to vote]] in federal [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] in 1971;&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |website=history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch | publisher = History of Switzerland |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title= Experts in women's anti-discrimination committee raise questions concerning reports of Switzerland on compliance with convention | date = 14 January 2003 |website=un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] |accessdate=September 2, 2011}} Press release: Meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).&lt;/ref&gt; In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]].

==Mirror representation==

Women's participation in formal politics is lower than men's throughout the world.&lt;ref name=NandW1&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = The women's movement in Canada | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 88 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument put forth by scholars Jacquetta Newman and Linda White is that women's participation in the realm of high politics is crucial if the goal is to affect the quality of public policy. As such, the concept of ''mirror representation'' aims to achieve gender parity in public office. In other words, mirror representation says that the proportion of women in leadership should match the proportion of women in the population that they govern. Mirror representation is premised on the assumption that elected officials of a particular gender would likely support policies that seek to benefit constituents of the same gender.

=== Effects of mirror representation on public policy ===
A key critique is that mirror representation assumes that all members of a particular sex operate under the rubric of a shared identity, without taking into consideration other factors such as age, education, culture, or socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="Pitkin 1967 61"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pitkin | first = Hannah F. | contribution = Formalistic views of representation | editor-last = Pitkin | editor-first = Hannah F. | title=The concept of representation |year=1967|publisher= University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|page=61 | isbn = 9780520021563 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of mirror representation argue that women have a different relationship with government institutions and public policy than that of men, and therefore merit equal representation on this facet alone. This feature is based on the historical reality that women, regardless of background, have largely been excluded from influential legislative and leadership positions. As Sylvia Bashevkin notes, "representative democracy seems impaired, partial, and unjust when women, as a majority of citizens, fail to see themselves reflected in the leadership of their polity."&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 15"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, power, politics: the hidden story of Canada's unfinished democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|page=15 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the issue of participation of Women in politics is of such importance that the United Nations has identified gender equality in representation (i.e. mirror representation) as a goal in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]] and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]].&lt;ref name="NandW2"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = The women's movement in Canada | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 89 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides seeking equality, the goal of mirror representation is also to recognize the significance of women's involvement in politics, which subsequently legitimizes said involvement.

There have been differing results between studies that looked at the significance of women's representation on actual policy outcomes. Though women in the United States are more likely to identify as feminists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/feminism-project/poll/|title=What Americans think about feminism today|last=Cai|first=Weiyi|date=January 27, 2016|access-date=November 11, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2014 study looking in the United States finds "no effect of gender of the mayor on policy outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferreira | first1 = Fernando | last2 = Gyourko | first2 = Joseph | title = Does gender matter for political leadership?

===Social and cultural barriers to mirror representation===
Mirror representation stems from the barriers female political candidates often face, these include: sex stereotyping, political socialization, lack of preparation for political activity, and balancing work and family. In the media, women are often asked how they would balance the responsibilities of elected office with those to their families, something men are never asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Beaudoux García | first = Virginia | title = Five ways the media hurts female politicians — and how journalists everywhere can do better | url = https://theconversation.com/five-ways-the-media-hurts-female-politicians-and-how-journalists-everywhere-can-do-better-70771 | work = [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = January 18, 2017 | access-date = January 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sex stereotyping'''. Sex stereotyping assumes that masculine and feminine traits are intertwined with leadership. Hence, the bias leveled against women stems from the perception that femininity inherently produces weak leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kittilson | first1 = Miki C. | last2 = Fridkin | first2 = Kim | title = Gender, candidate portrayals and election campaigns: a comparative perspective | journal = [[Politics and Gender]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | page = 373 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X08000330 | date = September 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X08000330 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the aggressive and competitive nature of politics, many insist that participation in elected office requires masculine traits.&lt;ref name="MacIvor 1996 240"&gt;{{Citation | last = MacIvor | first = Heather | contribution = Women's participation in politics | editor-last = MacIvor | editor-first = Heather | title=Women and politics in Canada: an introductory text |year=1996|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough, Ontario|page=242 | isbn = 9781551110363 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sex stereotyping is far from being a historical narrative. The pressure is on female candidates (and not male ones) to enhance their masculine traits in order to garner support from voters who identify with socially constructed gender roles.{{citation needed|reason=the claim that women in politics are pressured to conform to masculine roles is one that should be supported with research|date=February 2016}}

'''Political socialization'''. Political socialization is the idea that, during childhood, people are indoctrinated into socially constructed norms of politics. In the case of women's representation in government, it says that sex stereotyping begins at an early age and affects the public's disposition on which genders are fit for public office. Socialization agents can include family, school, higher education, mass media, and religion.&lt;ref name="NandW3"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = Women's participation in formal politics | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 99 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these agents plays a pivotal role in either fostering a desire to enter politics, or dissuading one to do so.

Generally, girls tend to see politics as a "male domain".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gidengil | first1 = Elisabeth | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = Brenda | last3 = Young | first3 = Lisa | title = Her mother's daughter?

Women running for U.S senate are often underrepresented in news coverage. The way male and females are depicted in media has an effect of how female's candidates gets elected in to public office. Female candidates get treated differently in the media then their male counterparts in the U.S senate elections, Women receive less news coverage also the coverage they do receive concentrates more on their viability and less on their issue positions, causes female candidates to be overlooked and underrated during elections, which is an obstacle for women running for U.S senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Kim Fridkin|last2=Goldenberg|first2=Edie N.|date=1991-01-01|title=WOMEN CANDIDATES IN THE NEWS: AN EXAMINATION OF GENDER DIFFERENCES IN U.S. SENATE CAMPAIGN COVERAGE|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/55/2/180/1810869|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|language=en|volume=55|issue=2|pages=180–199|doi=10.1086/269251|issn=0033-362X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lack of preparation for political activity'''. An aftereffect of political socialization is that it determines how inclined women are to pursue careers that may be compatible with formal politics. Careers in law, business, education, and government, professions in which women happen to be minorities, are common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.&lt;ref name=NandW4 /&gt;

'''Balancing work and family'''. The work life balance is invariably more difficult for women, because they are generally expected by society to act as the primary caregivers for children and maintainers of the home. Due to these demands, it is assumed that women would choose to delay political aspirations until their children are older. Also, a women's desire for a career in politics along with the extent that the respondent feels her family duties might inhibit her ability to be an elected official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elder|first1=Laurel|title=Why Women Don't Run|journal=Women &amp; Politics|date=21 September 2004|volume=26|issue=2|pages=27–56|doi=10.1300/J014v26n02_02|issn=0195-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that new female politicians in Canada and the U.S. are older than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=NandW5&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = Women's participation in formal politics | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 102 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a woman may be pushed to remain childless in order to seek political office.

Institutional barriers may also pose as a hindrance for balancing a political career and family. For instance, in Canada, Members of Parliament do not contribute to Employment Insurance; therefore, they are not entitled to paternity benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parliament of Canada|title=40th Parliament, 3rd  Session|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4694765#TOC-TS-1150|work=October 18, 2010|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Such lack of parental leave would undoubtedly be a reason for women to delay seeking electoral office. Furthermore, mobility plays a crucial role in the work-family dynamic. Elected officials are usually required to commute long distances to and from their respective capital cities, which can be a deterrent for women seeking political office.

==Policies to increase women's participation==
The United Nations has identified six avenues by which female participation in politics and government may be strengthened. These avenues are: equalization of educational opportunities, quotas for female participation in governing bodies, legislative reform to increase focus on issues concerning women and children, financing gender-responsive budgets to equally take into account the needs of men and women, increasing the presence of sex-disaggregated statistics in national research/data, and furthering the presence and agency of grassroots women's [[empowerment]] movements.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

===Education===
Women with formal education (at any level) are more likely to delay marriage and subsequent childbirth, be better informed about infant and child nutrition, and ensure childhood immunization. Children of mothers with formal education are better nourished and have higher survival rates.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Education is a vital tool for any person in society to better themselves in their career path, and equalization of educational opportunities for boys and girls may take the form of several initiatives:

* abolishment of educational fees which would require parents to consider financial issues when deciding which of their children to educate.

Mark P. Jones, in reference to [[Pippa Norris|Norris's]] ''Legislative Recruitment'', states that: "Unlike other factors that have been identified as influencing the level of women's legislative representation, such as a country's political culture and level of economic development, institutional rules are relatively easy to change".&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = Mark P. | title = Gender quotas, electoral laws, and the election of women: lessons from the Argentine provinces | journal = [[Comparative Political Studies]] | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–21 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0010414098031001001 | date = February 1998 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414098031001001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about the exclusion of Women from politics in southern Africa, Amanda Gouws said "The biggest hurdles to overcome for women are still on the local level where both men and women are often recruited from the communities and have limited political skills".&lt;ref name="Amanda"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gouws | first = Amanda | title = Changing women's exclusion from politics: examples from Southern Africa | journal = [[African and Asian Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–563 | publisher = [[Brill Publishers]] | doi = 10.1163/156921008X359650 | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1163/156921008X359650 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of education in these local governments or, for that matter, the people in those positions of power, are substandard.

One example of the hurdles women face in receiving good education comes from Beijing. "Most women who attended the [[NGO]] Forums accompanying the [[UN]] conferences, which are for government delegations (though increasingly many governments include activists and [[NGO]] members among their official delegates), were middle-class educated women from [[INGO|INGOS]], donors, academics, and activists".&lt;ref name="Manisha"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Desai | first = Manisha | title = Transnationalism: the face of feminist politics post-Beijing | journal = International Social Science Journal | volume = 57 | issue = 184 | pages = 319–330 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2451.2005.553.x | date = June 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2451.2005.553.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lydia Kompe, a well-known South African activist, was one of these rural women. She noted that she felt overwhelmed and completely disempowered. In the beginning, she did not think she could finish her term of office because of her lack of education.&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; Manisha Desai explains that: "There is an inequality simply around the fact that the [[UN]] system and its locations say a lot about the current focus of those systems, such positions being in the US and Western Europe allow easier access to those women in the area.&lt;ref name="Manisha" /&gt; It is also important to note that institutions affect the cultural propensity to elect women candidates in different ways in different parts of the world."&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

The study of the history of women's representation has been a major contribution in helping scholars view such concepts. [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] states: "historical experience often leads to gender advancement, and political liberalization enables women to mobilize within the public sphere".&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Reynolds (political scientist) | title = Women in the legislatures and executives of the world: knocking at the highest glass ceiling | journal = [[World Politics]] | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–572 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S0043887100009254 | date = July 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0043887100009254 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that we will see a larger number of women in higher office positions in established democracy than in democracies that are developing, and "the more illiberal a state is, the fewer women will be in positions of power".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;  As countries open education systems to women, and more women participate in historically male dominated fields, it is possible to see a shift in political views regarding women in government.

===Quotas===
{{further2|[[All-women shortlists]], a UK policy for electoral gender-parity}}

[[File:TRS ballot papers.svg|thumb|Example of a TRS ballot papers]]
Quotas are explicit requirements on the number of women in political positions.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt; "Gender quotas for the election of legislators have been used since the late 1970s by a few political parties (via the party charter) in a small number of advanced industrial democracies; such examples would be like [[Germany]] and [[Norway]]".&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] says there is "an increasing practice in legislatures for the state, or the parties themselves, to utilize formal or informal quota mechanisms to promote women as candidates and [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;  The statistics surrounding quota systems have been examined thoroughly by academia.

Types of quotas include:&lt;ref name="Fund 2004" /&gt;
* Sex quota systems: institute a "critical value" below which is deemed an imbalanced government. Examples of such critical values include 20% of legislators, 50%{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} of politicians, etc.
* Legal quota systems regulate the governance of political parties and bodies. Such quotas may be mandated by electoral law (as the [[Argentine quota law]], for example) or may be constitutionally required (as in Nepal).
* Voluntary party quota systems may be used by [[political parties]] at will, yet are not mandated by electoral law or by a country's constitution. If a country's leading or majority political party engages in a voluntary party quota system, the effect may "trickle down" to minority political parties in the country (as in the case of the African National Congress in South Africa).
Quotas may be utilized during different stages of the political nomination/selection process to address different junctures at which women may be inherently disadvantaged:&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt;
* Potential candidacy: sex quota systems can mandate that from the pool of aspirants, a certain percentage of them must be female.
* Nomination: legal or voluntary quotas are enforced upon this stage, during which a certain portion of nominated candidates on the party's ballot must be female.
* Election: "reserved seats" may be filled only by women.
Quota usage can have marked effects on female representation in governance. In 1995, Rwanda ranked 24th in terms of female representation, and jumped to 1st in 2003 after quotas were introduced. Similar effects can be seen in Argentina, Iraq, Burundi, Mozambique, and South Africa, for example.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt; Of the top-ranked 20 countries in terms of female representation in government, 17 of these countries utilize some sort of quota system to ensure female inclusion. Though such inclusion is mainly instituted at the national level, there have been efforts in India to addresses female inclusion at the subnational level, through quotas for parliamentary positions.&lt;ref name="IPU_class"&gt;''See'':
* {{cite web | title = Women in Parliaments: World classification | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] }}
* and {{cite web | title = Global Database of Quotas for Women: Country overview | url = http://www.quotaproject.org/country.cfm?SortOrder=LastLowerPercenta | website = quotaproject.org | publisher = [[International IDEA]], [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] and [[Stockholm University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With quotas drastically changing the number of female representatives in political power, a bigger picture unravels. Though countries are entitled to regulate their own laws, the quota system helps explain social and cultural institutions and their understandings and overall view of women in general. "At first glance, these shifts seem to coincide with the adoption of candidate gender quotas around the globe as quotas have appeared in countries in all major world regions with a broad range of institutional, social, economic and cultural characteristics".&lt;ref name="6Krook"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krook | first = Mona Lena | title = Reforming representation: the diffusion of candidate gender quotas worldwide | journal = [[Politics &amp; Gender]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–327 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X06060107 | date = September 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X06060107 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quotas have been quite useful in allowing women to gain support and opportunities when attempting to achieve seats of power, but some see this as a wrongdoing. [[Drude Dahlerup]] and Lenita Freidenvall argue this in their article "Quotas as a 'Fast Track' to Equal Representation for Women" by stating: "From a liberal perspective, quotas as a specific group right conflict with the principle of equal opportunity for all. Explicitly favoring certain groups of citizens, i.e. women, means that not all citizens (men) are given an equal chance to attain a political career".&lt;ref name=5Dahlerup&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dahlerup | first1 = Drude | last2 = Freidenvall | first2 = Lenita | title = Quotas as a "fast track"  to equal political representation for women: why Scandinavia is no longer the model | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–48 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/1461674042000324673 | date = 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461674042000324673 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahlerup and Freidenvall claim that even though quotas create theoretical imbalance in opportunity for men and that they necessarily break the concept of "classical liberal notion of equality",&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt; quotas are almost required to bring the relation of women in politics to a higher state, whether that is through equal opportunity or just equal results.&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt; "According to this understanding of women's under-representation, mandated quotas for the recruitment and election of female candidates, possibly also including time-limit provisions, are needed".&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt;

The introduction of gender quotas in the electoral process has spurred controversy from male politicians, resulting in resistance to the acceptance of quotas in the political realm.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;Krook, Mona. “Contesting gender quotas: dynamics of resistance.” Politics, Groups, and Identities, vol. 4, no. 2, 2016. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21565503.2016.1151797?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true. Accessed 25 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The mobilization of women in politics has been hindered by means of preserving male political survival, and to avoid political interference with male power and domination.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Moreover, the implementation of gender quotas has caused the male candidate population to decrease in order for their female counterparts to participate, and this is commonly referred to as the “negative sum,” and this can result in a more qualified male being rejected to allow a female politician to participate.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Furthermore, in the case of Argentina, which is currently mandated for a 30% female party at each level of government, saw the introduction of the 'quota women'; females that were less experienced, and only elected due to the legal requirement of quotas.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"&gt;Franceschet, Susan, and Jennifer M. Piscopo. “Gender Quotas and Women's Substantive Representation: Lessons from Argentina.” Politics &amp;Amp; Gender, vol. 4, no. 3, 2008, pp. 393–425., doi:10.1017/S1743923X08000342.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the 'quota women' has triggered what political scientists refer to as a 'mandate effect,' where quota women feel obligated to represent solely the interests of the female public.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Moreover, in order to preserve male political survival, “domination techniques” have been utilized to both exclude and delegitimize female representation in politics, and this can be depicted in the case of Argentina, where it took several elections to gain 35% of female representatives.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; With the increase of female representation in Argentina, issues that were rarely discussed before became paramount in debates, such as “penal laws, sexual assault laws, and laws on maternity leave and pregnancy… sexual education, [and] emergency contraceptive.”

Substantive representation contains two distinct parts: both the process and outcome of having female politicians.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Substantive representation based on the process is concerned with the gendered perspective, themes that female representatives discuss in political debates, and the impact they have on the creation of bills.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Likewise, this process also includes the networking between women in government and female organizations.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Substantive representation by outcome relates to the success of passing legislation that enables gender equality to both public and private issues.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Moreover, substantive representation as process does not always result in substantive representation by outcome; the implementation of gender quotas and female representation does not directly instigate an influx in legislation.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt;

Critical mass theory has correlations with both substantive representation as process and substantive representation as outcome. Critical mass theory suggests that once a certain percentage of women representatives has been reached, that female legislators will be able to create and enable transformative policies, and this has the potential to place pressure on quota women to act on behalf of all women.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; One paramount criticism of critical mass theory is its attention to numbers, and the understanding that quota women are to represent women collectively.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Furthermore, the representation of women as a collective group remains controversial, as “[if] she is a white straight, middle-class mother, she cannot speak for African-American women, or poor women, or lesbian women on the basis of her own experience anymore than men can speak for women merely on the basis of theirs.”&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt;

A 2018 study in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'' found that the implementation of electoral gender quotas which substantially increased women's representation in parliament led to increased government expenditures toward public health and relative decreases in military spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clayton|first=Amanda|last2=Zetterberg|first2=Pär|date=2018-05-10|title=Quota Shocks: Electoral Gender Quotas and Government Spending Priorities Worldwide|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/697251|journal=The Journal of Politics|language=en|pages=000–000|doi=10.1086/697251|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
There have been numerous occasions where equal legislation has benefited the overall progression of women equality on a global scale. Though women have entered legislation, the overall representation within higher ranks of government is not being established. "Looking at ministerial positions broken down by portfolio allocation, one sees a worldwide tendency to place women in the softer [[sociocultural]] ministerial positions rather than in the harder and politically more prestigious positions of economic planning, national security, and foreign affairs, which are often seen as stepping-stones to national leader ship".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

Legislative agendas, some pushed by female political figures, may focus on several key issues to address ongoing gender disparities:
* Reducing domestic and gender-based violence. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, published by the United Nations in 1989, addressed home violence and its effects on children. The Convention stipulates that children are holders of human rights, and authorizes the State to 1) prevent all forms of violence, and 2) respond to past violence effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = United Nations | title = Report of the independent expert for the United Nations study on violence against children – UN A/61/150 and Corr. 1 (provisional version) | url = https://disarmament-library.un.org/UNODA/Library.nsf/f860ad0cf3d61a518525711f006bb390/bba1dc9d335cbb1d852571b5005188c7/$FILE/agenda61.150.pdf | publisher = United Nations | location = New York | date = 23 August 2005 }}

It calls for "all parties of armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = United Nations | title =  Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), para. 10, adopted by the Security Council at its 4213th meeting | url = https://www.un.org/press/en/2000/20001031.sc6942.doc.html | publisher = United Nations | location = New York | date = 31 October 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Reducing in-home discrimination through equalizing [[property]] and [[inheritance]]  rights. National legislation can supersede traditionally male-dominated inheritance models. Such legislation has been proven effective in countries like Colombia, where 60% of land is held in joint titles between men and women (compared to 18% before the passage of joint titling legislation in 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mason | first1 = Andrew D. | last2 = King | first2 = Elizabeth M. | contribution = Social norms, laws, and economic institutions: rights and laws (land rights) | editor-last1 = Mason | editor-first1 = Andrew D. | editor-last2 = King | editor-first2 = Elizabeth M. | title = Engendering development through gender equality in rights, resources, and voice: A World Bank policy research report | url = http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/512911468327401785/Engendering-development-through-gender-equality-in-rights-resources-and-voice | page = 120 | publisher = World Bank and Oxford University Press | location = Washington DC | date = January 2001 | isbn = 9780195215960 }} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PGLP/Resources/Engendering_Development.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
Sex-responsive budgets address the needs and interests of different individuals and social groups, maintaining awareness of sexual equality issues within the formation of policies and budgets. Such budgets are not necessarily a 50–50 male-female split, but accurately reflect the needs of each sex (such as increased allocation for women's reproductive health.&lt;ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005"&gt;{{cite web | last =United Nations | title = Gender-responsive budgeting: manual for trainers | url = http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/gender-responsiveplanningandbudgeting.html | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = Bratislava | year = 2005 }} [https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/Gender%20Responsive%20Budgeting%20Trainers%20Manual.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of gender-responsive budgets include:
* Improved budget efficiency by ensuring that funds are allocated where they are needed most
* Strengthened government position by advocating for needs of all, including the poor and the underrepresented rights
* Increased information flow surrounding needs of those who are usually discriminated against
A sex-responsive budget may also work to address issues of unpaid care work and caring labor gaps.&lt;ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005"/&gt;

===Research/data improvements===
Current research which uses sex-aggregated statistics may underplay or minimize the quantitative presentation of issues such as maternal mortality, violence against women, and girls' school attendance.&lt;ref name="unicef.org" /&gt; Sex-disaggregated statistics are lacking in the assessment of maternal mortality rates, for example. Prior to [[UNICEF]] and [[UNIFEM]] efforts to gather more accurate and comprehensive data, 62 countries had no recent national data available regarding maternal mortality rates.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006"&gt;{{citation | last = United Nations | contribution = Chapter 2: Health | editor-last = United Nations | title = The world's women 2005: progress in statistics | page = 26 | publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] | location = New York | year = 2006 | url = https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/indwm/wwpub.htm | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/indwm/ww2005_pub/English/WW2005_chpt_2_Health_BW.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Only 38 countries have sex-disaggregated statistics available to report frequency of violence against women.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006" /&gt; 41 countries collect sex-disaggregated data on school attendance, while 52 countries assess sex-disaggregated wage statistics.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006"/&gt;

Though the representation has become a much larger picture, it is important to notice the inclination of political activity emphasizing women over the years in different countries. "Although women's representation in [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], and [[Western culture|the West]] progressed slowly until 1995, in the most recent decade, these regions show substantial growth, doubling their previous percentage".&lt;ref name="Paxton" /&gt;

Researching politics on a global scale does not just reinvent ideas of politics, especially towards women, but brings about numerous concepts. Sheri Kunovich and Pamela Paxton research method, for example, took a different path by studying "cross-national" implications to politics, taking numerous countries into consideration. This approach helps identify research beforehand that could be helpful in figuring out commodities within countries and bringing about those important factors when considering the overall representation of women. "At the same time, we include information about the inclusion of women in the political parties of each country".&lt;ref name="Kunovich" /&gt; Research within gender and politics has taken a major step towards a better understanding of what needs to be better studied. Dr. Mona L. Krook states: These kinds of studies help establish that generalizing countries together is far too limiting to the overall case that we see across countries and that we can take the information we gain from these studies that look at countries separately and pose new theories as to why countries have the concepts they do; this helps open new reasons and thus confirms that studies need to be performed over a much larger group of factors.&lt;ref name=7Krook&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krook | first = Mona Lena | title = Candidate gender quotas: a framework for analysis | journal = [[European Journal of Political Research]] | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–394 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00704.x | date = May 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00704.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.mlkrook.org/pdf/ejpr_07.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Authors and researchers such as Mala Htun and Laurel Weldon also state that single comparisons of established and developed countries is simply not enough but is also surprisingly hurtful to the progress of this research, they argue that focusing on a specific country "tends to duplicate rather than interrogate" the overall accusations and concepts we understand when comparing political fields.&lt;ref name=Htun&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Htun | first1 = Mala | last2 = Weldon | first2 = S.

* Modified version also [http://thedemocracypapers.ssrc.org/the-politics-of-policies-to-promote-gender-justice/ available online].&lt;/ref&gt; They continue by explaining that comparative politics has not established sex equality as a major topic of discussion among countries.&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; This research challenges the current standings as to what needs to be the major focus in order to understand gender in politics.

A 2018 study in the ''American Economic Journal: Economic Policy'' found that for German local elections "female council candidates advance more from their initial list rank when the mayor is female. This effect spreads to neighboring municipalities and leads to a rising share of female council members."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baskaran|first=Thushyanthan|last2=Hessami|first2=Zohal|date=August 2018|title=Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics?|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170045|journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=95–121|doi=10.1257/pol.20170045|issn=1945-7731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroots women's empowerment movements===
[[File:The lady in the case.jpg|thumb|The lady in the case, an example of how some have interpreted women's involvement in government]]
Women's informal collectives are crucial to improving the standard of living for women worldwide. Collectives can address such issues as nutrition, education, shelter, food distribution, and generally improved standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = McNulty | first = Stephanie | title = Women's organizations during and after war: from service delivery to policy advocacy | page = 3 | publisher = Center for Development Information and Evaluation, [[United States Agency for International Development|US Agency for International Aid]] | location = Washington, DC | date = 2 October 1998 | url = http://genderandsecurity.org/projects-resources/research/womens-organizations-during-and-after-war-service-delivery-policy | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Document ref: PN-ACD-336. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.511.2415&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Empowering such collectives can increase their reach to the women most in need of support and empowerment. Though women's movements have a very successful outcome with the emphasis on gaining equality towards women, other movements are taking different approaches to the issue. Women in certain countries, instead of approaching the demands as representation of women as "a particular interest group", have approached the issue on the basis of the "[[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] of sex differences and the relation to the nation".&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; Htun and Weldon also bring up the point of democracy and its effects on the level of equality it brings. In their article, they explain that a democratic country is more likely to listen to "[[autonomous]] organizing" within the government. Women's movements would benefit from this the most or has had great influence and impact because of [[democracy]], though it can become a very complex system.&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; When it comes to local government issues, political standings for women are not necessarily looked upon as a major issue. "Even civil society organizations left women's issues off the agenda. At this level, traditional leaders also have a vested interest that generally opposes women's interests".&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; Theorists believe that having a setback in government policies would be seen as catastrophic to the overall progress of women in government. Amanda Gouws says that "The instability of democratic or nominally democratic [[regimes]] makes women's political gains very vulnerable because these gains can be easily rolled back when regimes change. The failure to make the private sphere part of political contestation diminishes the power of formal democratic rights and limits solutions to gender inequality".&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; .

In 1902, [[Australia]] became the first country to give some women the vote and allow them to stand for Parliament. This did not apply to [[Aboriginal Australians]], including women, until the amendment of the [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918|Electoral Act]] in 1962. It wasn’t until 1983 that Indigenous people had voting rights entirely equal to white Australians when another amendment made enrollment to vote compulsory, rather than voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief03|title=No. 3 - Women in the Senate|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 years after the [[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902|Commonwealth Franchise Act]] was passed, [[Edith Cowan]] was elected to Legislative Assembly and became the first woman ever elected in any Australian Parliament. [[Dorothy Tangney]] was the first woman elected to the Australian senate in 1946, a seat she held for twenty-five years. In the same year, [[Enid Lyons|Dame Enid Lyons]] became the first woman elected to the House of Representatives. In 1986, [[Joan Child]] becomes the first female elected to [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] and held the position for over three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/elections/australian_electoral_history/milestone.htm|title=Electoral Milestones for Women|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two major political parties in Australia, the [[Australian Labor Party|Australian Labor Party (ALP)]] introduced a 35% quota in 1994 and increased this to 40% in 2002 whereas the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal National Party (LNP)]] currently has no gender-based quotas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/voluntary-overview|title=Voluntary Political Party Quotas|last=|first=|date=|website=International IDEA|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lnp.org.au/about/party-structure/lnp-women/|title=Liberal National Party Women|work=Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP)|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2018, women comprise approximately 38% of senators and occupy 44 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives. In the current [[45th Parliament of Australia|45&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Parliament]], the ALP exceeds their 40% quota and is made up of 44% women and the LNP 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief03|title=No. 3 - Women in the Senate|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;At January 1, 2017, Australia was ranked 52 out of 175 countries in terms of women in ministerial positions and 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;out of 190 countries in terms of women in the lower house of Parliament. The report issued by [[UN Women]] found 24.1% of, or 7 out of the 29 Australian ministers were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2017/femmesenpolitique_2017_english_web.pdf?la=en&amp;vs=1123|title=Women in Politics: 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=UN Women|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2007 was a notable year for women in Australian Parliament. [[Anna Bligh]] became Queensland’s first female premier, a position she occupies for five years, and [[Julia Gillard|Julia Gilliard]] MP becomes Deputy Prime Minister. Three years later, Gilliard is elected as Australia’s first female prime minister. [[Quentin Bryce|Dame Quentin Bryce]] became the first and only woman appointed to [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], a position that is representative of the Monarch, in 2008 and served until 2014. [[Christine Milne]] is the only woman that has been head of a major political party when she was elected leader of the [[Australian Greens]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief03|title=No. 3 - Women in the Senate|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous people, women in particular, are grossly underrepresented in Australian Parliament. Since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, there have been 40 Indigenous Australians involved in any Parliament (sixteen women) and eight in the Federal Parliament (four women). Following are some notable figures:&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/elections/australian_electoral_history/milestone.htm|title=Electoral Milestones for Women|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Carol Martin]] of Western Australia was the first Indigenous woman elected to any Australian Parliament in 2001 and was subsequently re-elected in 2005 and 2008.

* [[Marion Scrymgour|Marion Scrygmour]] of the Northern Territory became the first Aboriginal woman minister in any Australian government in 2002 and became the highest-ranked Indigenous woman in government with her service as Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 2007-2009.

In [[History of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], placing women in government has progressed better than in other [[Islamic countries]].  Universal suffrage was introduced in [[Azerbaijan]] in 1918 by the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], thus making Azerbaijan the first [[Muslim-majority countries]] and Turk-majority countries ever to enfranchise women. Now, 28 women are members in the [[Azerbaijan Parliament]] ([[Milli Məclis]]). As of 2015, there were 21 women in the 125-seat parliament. The percentage of female members of parliament increased from 11 to 17 percent between 2005 and 2015. Traditional social norms and lagging economic development in the country's rural regions continued to restrict the role of women in the economy, and there were reports that women had difficulty exercising their legal rights due to gender discrimination. As of May 2009, women held the positions of Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Court, Deputy Chairman of the Nakhchivan AR Cabinet of Ministers, four Deputy Ministers, an Ambassador, and Ombudsmen of [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] AR. Women constituted 4 of the 16 members of the Central Election Commission and chaired of 3 of the 125 district election commissions. Some famous female managers in historical [[Azerbaijan]] territories mentioned below:
* [[Tomyris]] – antic women leader of [[Scythians]], was born in near of [[Araks River]]

===Brazil===
A 1995 Brazilian gender quota was extended first to city councilor positions in 1996, then extended to candidates of all political legislative positions by 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sacchet | first = Teresa | title = Beyond numbers: the impact of gender quotas in Latin America | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–386 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14616740802185700 | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/14616740802185700 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998, 30% of political candidates had to be women, with varied results in terms of the gender balance of the officials ultimately elected. Though the percentage of national legislature seats occupied by women dropped in the initial years following the passage of the quota law, the percentage has since risen (from 6.2% pre-quota, to 5.7% in 1998, to 8.9% in 2006). However, Brazil has struggled with the quota law in several respects:
* Though the quota law mandates a certain percentage of candidate spots be reserved for women, it is not compulsory that those spots be filled by women.
* The quota law also allowed political parties to increase the number of candidates, further increasing electoral competition and having a negligible impact on the actual number of women elected.

=== China ===
China's stipulation for gender equality in the political sphere started on as early as recorded in its 1954 Constitution, in which the PRC government stated that men and women enjoy equal rights in the aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family dimensions, especially highlighting legitimate voting right and the right to be elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Xiajuan|date=January 2008|title=The rise of affirmative action|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/iaps/documents/cpi/briefings/briefing-34-women-political-participation.pdf|journal=WOMEN'S POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN CHINA|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another State document – Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Woman – also outlined an official requirement of 'appropriate number of women deputies', combined with the State's obligations to 'gradually increase the proportion of the women deputies' and 'actively trains and selects female cadres' in fundamental national institutions and political organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207405.htm|title=Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=www.china.org.cn|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades that follow, China has been making revision to its constitutional laws and State announcements to give recognition to  women's role in the domain of governance. An example of which is the proclamation issued on the 5th meeting session of the 10th National People's Congress (NPC) necessitating that 'the proportion of women delegates to be elected to the 11th People's Congress should be no less than 20%'.

However, regardless of the proper representation of women's political eligibility across multiple government declarations, the political system in China remains overwhelmingly male-dominated which in turns drives the low engagement rate of women delegates. Despite the new 13th NPC lineup with a composition of 742 women out of 2,980 representatives, which amounts to 24.9% penetration with 1.5 points increase as opposed to the former term,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/24/c_136997333.htm|title=More women, fewer officials on China's top legislature – Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn|website=www.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is mere presence of women in the central power structure in major government organs and their political influences are vastly diminished as they climb up the political ladder. Justifications of the above statement include the fact that only 33 women (9%) are recorded to have a seat at the table of Central Committee for the election of members into the Politburo, a key cornerstone for the approval all national affairs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41652487|title=Reality Check: Are women welcome in Chinese politics?|date=2017-10-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, except for the two consecutive office in 1973 and 1977, the Central Committee has never witnessed over 10% of women engagement in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=ZQMtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=-+With+the+exception+of+the+10th+Party+Congress+in+1973+and+the+11th+Party+Congress+in+1977,+women+have+never+made+up+more+than+10+percent+of+the+total+membership+of+the+Central+Committee.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-wRi5Wu_TB&amp;sig=nh4Ec2KLGA-hVTYf8RbM5Q5NLSk&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh_I29_8bZAhVMk5QKHRYZDgcQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=-%20With%20the%20exception%20of%20the%2010th%20Party%20Congress%20in%201973%20and%20the%2011th%20Party%20Congress%20in%201977,%20women%20have%20never%20made%20up%20more%20than%2010%20percent%20of%20the%20total%20membership%20of%20the%20Central%20Committee.&amp;f=false|title=Young China: How the Restless Generation Will Change Their Country and the World|last=Dychtwald|first=Zak|date=2018-02-13|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9781466891333|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the above figure is the decline in the 25-member Politburo from two women down to one. In addition, the recent reappointment of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, has sparked controversy on the unbroken record of no-women Politburo Standing Committee and absence of female top leaders in any legislature in China's political history, apart from the exceptions of Vice Premier, Liu Yandong and Vice Foreign Minister, Fu Ying. The public has been compelled to draw parallel with Hong Kong and Taiwan where female presidents – Carrie Lam and Tsai Ing-wen – took office in 2018 and 2016 respectively.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/22/asia/china-female-leaders/index.html|title=Why China has so few female leaders|last=CNN|first=Yazhou Sun,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male-heavy politics amidst the favorable women's right protection in China can be examined from the following underlying causes:

''(1) Deprivation of upward mobility''

While the implied prerequisite of national appointment is years of experience serving at middle-to-top management, women in the PRC government often struggle to obtain promotion to high-ranked positions, such as party secretary or principal governor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The reason contributing to the captioned phenomenon is gender division of labor across all levels of political structures. Contrary to Mao Zedong's saying that 'Women hold up half of the sky', Confucians principles' deeply ingrained advocacy “nan zhu wai, nu zhu nei” (men working on the outside, women's place remains on the inside) has shaped gender division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Xianghong|date=2013-07-01|title=Women's Work, Men's Work: Gender and Tourism among the Miao in Rural China|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/awr.12002/abstract|journal=Anthropology of Work Review|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=2–14|doi=10.1111/awr.12002|issn=1548-1417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being assigned highly gender-biased responsibilities within the spectrum of 'women affairs', such as family planning that are reproduction-oriented or with connection to social construction, women's public role and scope of duty are framed under constraints. Women are, at the same time, missing the opportunities to keep a foothold in strategic national affairs, including but not limited to economic development, military planning and diplomatic involvement. The mentioned dilemma is reflected by an actual example in Ning Xiang County, Hunan Province. Women commonly maintain highest authority as Head in women-related bodies, administering concerns on women's unfair treatments and suggesting for children's health development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Jude|date=January 2008|title=The representation of women in rural politics|url=|journal=Women's Political Participation in China: in whose interests elections?|volume=|pages=|via=Journal of Contemporary China}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, the gendered portfolio gives rise to empowerment of male in the political hierarchal. Consequently, with the lack of exposure to the exemplary official posts and the exclusive offering of key national assignments for men, women's upward mobility is aggravated, resulting in the substantially dwindling likelihood of taking residence in key leading positions.

''(2) Biased retirement precondition prejudicing against women''

In China, there is an apparent discrepancy in the mandatory retirement age between men and women, in which men are entitled to enjoy 10 more years of work. This policy was established on the ground that women are primary and central support for domestic subjects and their early retirement (at the age of 50–55) would be beneficial to their overall family functioning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This discriminatory policy mirrors the cause in the previous part, in which the working capacity of women is restricted by the society's stereotype on their gender role and corresponding gender responsibilities. In addition, the average age of Chinese chief in Central Committee is 56.1 years old; Top leaders in Politburo were appointed at an average age of 61.1 years old; Whereas Standing Committee of Politburo has the highest average age of 63.4 for its office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jinghan|first=Zeng|year=2014|title=Institutionalization of the authoritarian leadership in China: a power succession system with Chinese characteristics?|journal=[[Contemporary Politics]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=294–314|doi=10.1080/13569775.2014.911502|via=[[ResearchGate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; All figures being examined, the aggregated average age of appointed leaders exceeds the legal retirement age of women in the nation, meaning that women are least likely to become the center of power before their career come to an end.

(3) ''Anti-feminism''

While in foreign countries, women's socio-economic status is uplifted and gender division of labor is largely wiped out by feminist movements to open up the availability and variety of work for women, the conservative and politically-sensitive Chinese government's censorship on feminism within the country has spread fear among feminism advocates. An illustrative case of which is the backlash of 'Feminist Five' in China. The activists suffered from interrogation, detention and month-long imprisonment due to the distribution of stickers on Beijing subways for drawing the wider community's awareness to sexual harassment against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/08/feminist-stickers-china-backash-women-activists|title=I went to jail for handing out feminist stickers in China {{!}} Li Maizi|last=Maizi|first=Li|date=2017-03-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed by the forced suspension of Weibo account 'Feminist Voices' due to the government's tightened censorship, feminist encountered escalated obstacles in promoting gender equality. Feminist movements are yet to achieve their goals.

===Finland===
The Finnish national quota law, introduced in 1995, mandates that among all indirectly elected public bodies (at both a national and a local level), neither sex in the governing body can be under 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Holli | first1 = Anne Maria | last2 = Luhtakallio | first2 = Eeva | last3 = Raevaara | first3 = Eeva | title = Quota trouble: talking about gender quotas in Finnish local politics | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–193 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14616740600612822 | date = June 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/14616740600612822 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://blogs.helsinki.fi/holli/files/2013/05/RFJP1612641.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 laws was a reformed version of a similar 1986 law. Unlike other countries' quota laws, which affect party structure or electoral candidate lists, the Finnish law addresses indirectly elected bodies (nominated by official authorities)—the law does not address popularly elected bodies. The Finnish law heavily emphasizes local municipal boards and other subnational institutions. From 1993 (pre-quota law) to 1997 (post-quota law), the proportion of women on municipal executive boards increased from 25% to 45%. The quota law also affected gender segregation in local governance: before the passage of the law, there had been a gender imbalance in terms of female overrepresentation in "soft-sector" boards (those concerned with health, education, etc.) and female "underrepresentation" in "hard-sector" boards (those concerned with economics and technology). In 1997, the boards were balanced horizontally. However, areas not subject to quota laws continue to be imbalanced. In 2003, it was determined that only 16% of the chairs of municipal executive boards are female—chair positions in this area are not quota-regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pikkala | first = Sari | title = Representations of women in Finnish local government: effects of the 1995 gender quota legislation | year = 2000 }} Paper presented at the European Consortium on Political Research Joint Sessions of Workshops, Copenhagen, 14–19 April.
&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential elections were held in Finland on 16 January 2000, with a second round on 6 February;&lt;ref name=DN&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Nohlen | editor-first1 = Dieter | editor-last2 = Stöver | editor-first2 = Philip | editor-link1 = Dieter Nohlen | title = Elections in Europe: a data handbook | page = 606 | publisher = Nomos | location = Baden-Baden, Germany | year = 2010 | isbn = 9783832956097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the result was a victory for [[Tarja Halonen]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], who became the country's first female President.

===Germany===
	The gender quotas implemented across parties in Germany in the 1990s serve as a natural experiment for the effect of sub-national party political gender quotas on women participation. Davidson-Schmich (2006) notes, "the German case provides the variance needed to explain the successful (or failed) implementation of these political party quotas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Davidson-Schmich | first = Louise K. | title = Implementation of political party gender quotas: evidence from the German Länder 1990–2000 | journal = [[Party Politics]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–232 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1354068806061338 | date = March 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/1354068806061338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.1797&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's sixteen state legislatures, the Länder, feature a variety of party systems and varied numbers of potential female candidates. Germany is rated highly in its gender gap, but is an example of a developed country with a low percentage of female leadership in politics.
	Davidson-Schmich's study shows that there are many factors that influence how effective a political quota for women will be. Because Germany's quotas cover culturally diverse areas, Davidson-Schmich was able to see which cities best responded to the increase in women running for office. In her bivariate study, the quota was more successful when the city had a PR electoral system, when more women held inner-party and local political offices, and when there were more women in state-level executive offices. The quota was less successful in rural areas, areas with a large number of Catholic voters, electoral systems with a preferential system, in extremely competitive party systems, and with greater rates of legislative turnover. In her multivariate study of these regions, however, Davidson-Schmich narrowed these factors down even further to the most significant variables of: Catholicism and agricultural economics (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;228). This is very intriguing, and as she explains, "the success of voluntary gender quotas in the German states hinged not on the political structure of these Lander, but rather the willingness of within the system to act on the opportunities inherent in these structures" (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;228). Social factors and inherent gender discrimination are more important in the success of a female political quota than the structure of the quota itself.

Due to the randomized selection of cities who must enforce the reservation for women each election year, some cities have implemented the quota multiple times, once or never. This addresses the political discrimination of women at various levels: parties are forced to give women the opportunity to run, the women candidates are not disadvantaged by a male incumbent or general biases for male over female leadership, and the pool of women candidates is increased because of the guaranteed opportunity for female participation.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009" /&gt;  The effects of the quota system in India have been studied by various researchers.  In Mumbai, it was found that the probability of a women winning office conditional on the constituency being reserved for women in the previous election is approximately five times the probability of a women winning office if the constituency had not been reserved for women".&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009"/&gt;  Furthermore, that even when the mandates are withdrawn, women were still able to keep their positions of leadership. Given the opportunity to get a party ticket, create a platform and obtain the experience to run for a political position, women are much more likely to be able to overcome these hurdles in the future, even without the quota system in place.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009"/&gt; The quota system has also affected policy choices. Research in West Bengal and Rajasthan has indicated that reservation affected policy choices in ways that seem to better reflect women's preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chattopadhyay | first1 = Raghabendra | last2 = Duflo | first2 = Esther | title = Women as policy makers: evidence from a randomized policy experiment in India | journal = [[Econometrica]] | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1409–1443 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00539.x | jstor = 3598894 | date = September 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00539.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://economics.mit.edu/files/792 Pdf.]

However, while reservation did not make male villagers more sympathetic to the idea of female leaders, it caused them to recognize that women could lead. Moreover, the reservation policy significantly improved women's prospects in elections open to both sexes, but only after two rounds of reservation within the same village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beaman | first1 = Lori | last2 = Chattopadhyay | first2 = Raghabendra | last3 = Duflo | first3 = Esther | last4 = Pande | first4 = Rohini | last5 = Topalova | first5 = Petia | title = Powerful women: does exposure reduce bias? | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 124 | issue = 4 | pages = 1497–1540 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1497 | date = November 2009  | url = https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://economics.mit.edu/files/3122 Pdf.]

===Japan===
Japan ranks 127 in the world for the number of women in national parliamentary worldwide as of March 2014, which is lower than that of 2013 in which Japan ranked at 122.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kyodo | author-link = Kyodo News | title = Japan falls to 127th global ranking of female lawmakers | url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/03/12/national/japan-falls-to-127th-global-ranking-of-female-lawmakers/ |work = [[The Japan Times]] | date = March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 28, 2013, there are a total of 39 women in the House of Representatives out of 479 incumbents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strength of political groups in the House of Representatives | url = http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_english.nsf/html/statics/english/strength.htm | website = shugiin.go.jp | publisher = The House of Representatives | location = Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the enactment of the modern [[Constitution of Japan|Japanese Constitution]] in 1947, Japanese women have been given the right to vote, and the new version of the constitution also allows for a more democratic form of government that guarantees women equality under the law. 
The first female cabinet member, [[Masa Nakayama]], was appointed as the Minister of Health and Welfare in Japan in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm|title=International Women's Democracy Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Until 1996, the electoral system for the House of Representatives was based on a single non-transferable vote in multi-member districts. That system was not conducive to women's advancement in public office because it promoted contestation between competing parties and rival candidates within the same party,{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} but overall, the new electoral system was introduced to reduce the excessive role of money and corruption in elections, which ultimately helped women who were running for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Iwanaga | first= Kazuki | title = Women's political representation and electoral system in Japan }} 1st International Conference Women and Politics in Asia. Conference Paper. Halmstad: Halmstad University, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Japanese politics, the [[Koenkai|kōenkai]] is a major factor for a successful outcome of an election. The kōenkai, or "local support groups", serve as pipelines through which funds and other support are conveyed to legislators and through which the legislators can distribute favors to constituents in return. Because gaining support from these groups is usually based on personal connections, women's historically disadvantaged position in networking circles hurts their ability to run for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Krauss | first1 = Ellis S. | last2 = Pekkanen | first2 = Robert J. | contribution = The kōenkai: origin and development of a vote-mobilization machine | editor-last1 = Krauss | editor-first1 = Ellis S. | editor-last2 = Pekkanen | editor-first2 = Robert J. | title = The rise and fall of Japan's LDP : political party organizations as historical institutions | pages = 32–33 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780801476822 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1996, Japan adopted another new electoral system for the House of Representatives that combines single-seat districts with proportional representation. Out of 480 seats, 300 are contested in single seat constituencies. The other 180 members are elected through allocations to an electoral list submitted by each party. Candidates who lack a strong support system are listed on a party's proportional representation section. In the 2009 election, only two of eight female [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] members were elected from a single-seat district, which indicates that few female candidates have enough political support to win a single-seat election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Nakano | first =Yūko | title = Japan chair platform: among equals? Women in Japanese politics | url = http://csis.org/publication/japan-chair-platform-among-equals-women-japanese-politics | publisher = Center for Strategic and International Studies |date = July 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While changes in the electoral process have made positions of public office more accessible to women, the actual participation of women in the Diet remains relatively low. 
As for the future of women in politics in Japan, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced in his speech at the Japan National Press Club on April 19, 2013, that a major goal of his national growth strategy is "having no less than 30 per cent of leadership positions in all areas of society filled by women by 2020." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Speech on growth strategy by Prime Minister Shinzō Abe at the Japan National Press Club | url = http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/96_abe/statement/201304/19speech_e.html | website = .kantei.go.jp | publisher = Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet | date = April 19, 2013 }} (Speeches and Statements by Prime Minister.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demonstrating women.jpg|thumb|Lebanese women marching for their rights]]
Lebanese women are considered to have more rights and freedom compared to other women in the Gulf and Middle East.{{By whom|date=June 2017}} Women in Lebanon are able to dress more liberally and move around with relative ease in certain parts of the country, unlike other countries in the region. Lebanese women enjoy almost equal civil rights as men. However, due to the large number of officially recognized religions in Lebanon, Lebanese family matters are governed by at least 15 personal statute codes. Lebanese women have legal protection that varies depending on their religion.

Local and regional NGOs have helped to increase awareness of violence against women in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnf.org.lb/windex/introduction.html|title=Women's Rights Monitor|date=|publisher=Lnf.org.lb|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Mar-25/167921-over-30-ngos-demonstrate-for-womens-rights.ashx#axzz1rcyhFq4K|title=Over 30 NGOs demonstrate for women's rights|date=|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government policies regarding this are poor however, and attempts to improve this area have been met with resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/95033/LEBANON-Tussle-over-gender-violence-law|title=IRIN Middle East &amp;#124; Lebanon: Tussle over gender violence law &amp;#124; Lebanon &amp;#124; Early Warning &amp;#124; Gender Issues &amp;#124; Governance &amp;#124; Human Rights &amp;#124; Security|date=2012-03-08|publisher=Irinnews.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon's laws do not recognize the concept of spousal rape,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/lebanon|title=Gender Equality in Lebanon &amp;#124; Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|date=|publisher=Genderindex.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to add this to law have been attacked by Lebanese clerics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article462177.ece|title=Lebanon's clerics attack domestic violence law|last=Miller|first=David E.|accessdate=February 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630135532/http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article462177.ece|archivedate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
In 2016, the Dutch government achieved their goal for women in top jobs within the government. A 30% female share was achieved two years earlier than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/rijksoverheid-haalt-streefcijfer-vrouwen-in-topfuncties~a4302524/|title=Rijksoverheid haalt streefcijfer vrouwen in topfuncties – Politiek – Voor nieuws, achtergronden en columns|last=Giebels|first=Robert|website=De Volkskrant|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, the number of women in top jobs is behind in the political sector. In 2013, the listed companies inserted a 'one in three' rule, which meant that of every three top jobs, one must be exerted by a woman. Not long after, it turned out companies did not put much effort in to achieving this goal, as in practice even less than one in every ten top jobs was occupied by women. The goal for women in top jobs was postponed to 2023. Government and the business sector agreed that if every one in five top jobs is not exerted by women, after 2018 the 30% rule will become mandatory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bakker, F. S., &amp; Kartner, F. (2013). Excuustruus of echte topvrouw? Over de wenselijkheid van vrouwenquota in het bedrijfsleven. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, women's quota received a fair share of criticism. It has been argued that women should be employed based on their own qualities, not because of their gender.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Romania===
No political gender quotas exist in Romania, however the Equality Act of 2002 provides that public authorities and institutions, political parties, employers' organizations and trade unions must provide an equitable and balanced representation of men and women at all decisional levels.&lt;ref&gt;Current legal framework: {{cite web | url=http://www.impowr.org/research/romania/Participation%20in%20policy%20formation%20and%20implementation | title=Participation in policy formation and implementation in Romania | website = impowr.org | publisher = International Models Project on Women's Rights (IMPOWR) | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Romanian legislative election, 2016|2016 elections]], women gained only 20.7% of seats in the Lower House ([[Chamber of Deputies (Romania)|Romanian Chamber of Deputies]]) and 14.7% in the Upper House ([[Senate of Romania]]).&lt;ref name="IPU_class" /&gt; These figures are up from the 4.9% of women in the Romanian Parliament in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/women_Parliament.pdf | title=The evolution of woman representation in Romanian Parliament | website = roaep.ro | publisher= Romania Autoritatea Electorala Permanenta [Permanent Electoral Authority] | date = February 2013 | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, women are well represented in the central public administration, including the [[Government of Romania|Government]], with more than half of decision-making positions held by women, according to a 2011 study commissioned by the [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Ministry of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Role of traditions: {{cite web | url=http://www.impowr.org/research/romania/Participation%20in%20policy%20formation%20and%20implementation | title=Participation in policy formation and implementation in Romania | website = impowr.org | publisher = International Models Project on Women's Rights (IMPOWR) | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rwanda===
	Since the election of 2008, Rwanda is the first country to have a majority of women in legislature.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Haerpfer | first2 = Christian | last3 = Wallace | first3 = Claire | author-link1 = Pamela Abbott | title = Women in Rwandan politics and society | journal = [[International Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 111–125 | doi = 10.2753/IJS0020-7659380406 | date = Winter 2008  |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2753/IJS0020-7659380406 | publisher = M.

After the genocide that killed 800,000 Tutsis in 100 days, women in legislature went from 18% women before the conflict to 56% in 2008. Two pieces of legislature enabled and supported women into leadership positions: the Security Council Resolution of 1325 urged women to take part in the post-conflict reconstruction and the 2003 Rwandan Constitution included a mandated quota of 30% reserved seats for all women in legislature. Of the 24 women who gained seats directly after the quota implementation in 2003, many joined political parties and chose to run again. Though it took almost 10 years, after implementing the gender quotas, Rwanda reached levels of female representation which are amongst the highest in the world.&lt;ref name="Carmichael" /&gt; Once again we can see the quota working as an "incubator" for driving women's participation in leadership.

It is argued that the increase of female leadership in Rwanda also led to an increase in gender equality. World Focus (2009) writes, "Rwandan voters have elected women in numbers well beyond the mandates dictated by the post-genocide constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The top ten innovative global solutions of the decade (blog) | url = http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/12/30/the-top-10-innovative-global-solutions-of-the-decade/8991/ | website = worldfocus.org | publisher = Worldfocus | date = December 30, 2009 | access-date = September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And though women in Rwanda still face discrimination, female legislators have influenced major reforms in banking and property laws." A parliamentary women's caucus in Rwanda (FFRP) has also "led a successful effort to pass ground-breaking legislation on gender-based violence in part by involving and garnering support from their male colleagues".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

While some researchers see reform, others see dominant party tactics. Hassim (2009) writes, "It could be argued that in both countries [Uganda and Rwanda] women's representation provided a kind of alibi for the progressive, 'democratic' nature of new governments that at their core nevertheless remained authoritarian, and increasingly so".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hassim | first = Shireen | contribution = Perverse consequences?

===Spain===
In 2007, Spain passed the Equality Law, requiring a "principle of balanced presence" by mandating political parties to include 40–60% of each sex among electoral candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Verge | first = Tània | title = Gendering representation in Spain: opportunities and limits of gender quotas | journal = [[Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–190 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/15544771003697247 | date = 2010 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/15544771003697247 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is unique in that surpasses the 40% parity figure established by the European Commission in 1998; a figure which (according to the EC) indicates "parity democracy." Though there is anecdotal evidence of increasing female representation on a local and national level, there has not yet been national-level data to quantitatively bolster this assertion.

On June 6, 2018, Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party, presented his cabinet which included eleven women and six men, making it the cabinet with the highest proportion of women in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20180606/gobierno-mujeres-europeista-experiencia-gestion-independientes-fotografia-del-nuevo-gabinete/1746182.shtml|title=Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez: El Gobierno de las mujeres|date=6 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States no political gender quotas exist, mandatory or voluntary. The proportion of women in leadership roles in the Senate, House of Representatives, and Presidential positions reflect this. Although the proportion has grown since the first female elected into the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lieber|first1=Constance |last2=Sillitos |first2=John |title= Martha Hughes Cannon |url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/people/marthahughescannon.html|website=Utah History To Go|publisher=Utah State Historical Society|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current position of women representation in the U.S. is precarious. In the elections of 2012, the greatest number of female incumbents ever were up for re-election in the Senate. Ten female Democrats, six of them incumbents, were nominated, with one Republican nominated for Senate ran for office.&lt;ref name="Steinhauer, Jennifer 2011"&gt;{{cite news | last = Steinhauer | first = Jennifer | author-link = Jennifer Steinhauer | title = More women in Senate, but seats are at risk | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/us/politics/women-could-have-banner-year-in-2012-election.html | work = [[The New York Times|New York Times Journal]] | date = October 20, 2011 | location = New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinhauer notes that in Congress, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, women historically and currently lack representation.

From 1917, when Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman to serve in Congress, to the 115th congress, a total of 329 women have served as U.S. Representatives, Delegates, or Senators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/wic/|title=Women in Congress {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917 to 2018, the United States has had 277 women serve in the House of Representatives.

From 1922, when Senator Rebecca Latimer Felton became the first woman to serve in the Senate, to 2018 52 women have served in the United States Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/women_senators.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Women in the Senate|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 115th Congress, 107 (78D, 29R) women hold seats in the United States Congress, comprising 20.0% of the 535 members; 23 women (23%) serve in the U.S. Senate, and 84 women (19.3%) serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2018|title=Women in the U.S. Congress 2018|date=2015-06-12|work=CAWP|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States is one of the shrinking number of industrialized democracies to not have yet had a woman as its leader. Worldwide, female prime ministers include Canada's [[Kim Campbell]], the UK's [[Margaret Thatcher]], Australia's [[Julia Gillard]], Israel's [[Golda Meir]], and France's [[Édith Cresson]]. Other female national leaders include Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] of Germany, President [[Dilma Rousseff]] of Brazil, and President [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]] of Argentina. Even Pakistan and Turkey, countries often viewed as particularly male-dominated have had female prime ministers. Therefore, the United States, a country which promotes the rights of women and girls around the world, is conspicuous for having only male presidents.

In popular media in the United States, female politicians see some focus on their appearance; more so than their male counterparts. A 2011 feminist journal by Carlin and Winfrey focuses on the portrayal of female politicians in the media. According to the journal, the way media perceives women and men is very distinct in the language they chose to use. The language chosen to talk or describe other people can either hurt or help them in a political campaign. As a result of
women being talked about in sexist terms in can greatly affect her reputation and credibility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carlin | first1 = Diana B. | last2 = Winfrey | first2 = Kelly L. | title = Have you come a long way, baby?

The journal claims the media uses terms that indicative of women not being valued as individuals.  "This is especially true when women are described using metaphors that draw on animals, children, or food. Animal terms focus on the appearance and sexuality of young women (foxy), and as women grow older, or are seen as too aggressive, they may be called barracuda, old bat, shrew, or cow."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Females tend to have less issue coverage than males (due to fewer female politicians), but tend to have more coverage on things such as their appearance than male politicians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Men candidates don't get coverage on what kind of suite they are wearing or who designed it. This is due to innate purpose of the media to appeal to demands of their audiences for sales – in this case the popular female focus on fashion that dominates the media. Studies done on women candidates have shown that women receive more attention in the media for factors such as appearance, clothes, size, and emotional state&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;".
In 2015 Rachel Silbermann conducted a study that time spent traveling to and from work is particularly burdensome for those who spend time caring for children, and as women do a majority of the child care and housework, commuting is particularly burdensome to them. Silbermann also found that female students weigh proximity to home twice as heavily as male students do in a hypothetical decision of whether to run for higher office. She suggests that to achieve equal representation of women in government men and women will need to share household responsibilities more equally.&lt;ref name="Silberman, R. 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Silbermann | first = Rachel | title = Gender roles, work-life balance, and running for office | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–153 | publisher = Now Publishing Inc. | doi = 10.1561/100.00014087 | date = June 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1561/100.00014087 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found no evidence that the low share of women in the  U.S. House of Representative was due to gender discrimination by voters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Anastasopoulos |first=Lefteris | title = Estimating the gender penalty in House of Representative elections using a regression discontinuity design | journal = [[Electoral Studies]] | volume = 43 | issue =  | pages = 150–157 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.008 | date = September 2016 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.008 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the author of the study, "these results suggest that the deficit of female representation in the House is more likely the result of barriers to entering politics as opposed to overt gender discrimination by voters and campaign donors."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that over the last decade, public opposition to &amp;nbsp;electing a woman as president was reduced from approximately 26% to 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burden|first=Barry C.|last2=Ono|first2=Yoshikuni|last3=Yamada|first3=Masahiro|date=2017-05-04|title=Reassessing Public Support for a Female President|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691799|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=79|issue=3|pages=1073–1078|doi=10.1086/691799|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

A 2018 study in the ''American Political Science Review'' did not find evidence that American voters were outright hostile to women in politics or that they held double standards. The study did however find that American voters preferred candidates who were married and had children. Since the burdens of child-rearing disproportionately fall on women in households, the bias in favor of married candidates with children may explain women's underrepresentation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teele|first=Dawn Langan|last2=Kalla|first2=Joshua|last3=Rosenbluth|first3=Frances|date=2018|title=The Ties That Double Bind: Social Roles and Women's Underrepresentation in Politics|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/ties-that-double-bind-social-roles-and-womens-underrepresentation-in-politics/617A9986FF59B8934BC300DA21984121|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=|pages=1–17|doi=10.1017/S0003055418000217|issn=0003-0554|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Case Studies =====

====== Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton ======
In 2008, campaigns for both Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton were taken in great interest by fashion articles read mostly by women. The journal claims that Clinton was perceived as masculine and Palin was seen as feminine. "Palin's attractiveness resulted in frequent and varied references to her ''sexiness''; whereas, Clinton was viewed as not feminine enough in pantsuits that covered her ''cankles'' (thick ankles).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Various newspapers covered on how Palin was part of beauty pageants and this really affected the seriousness of her campaign. They took Palin as a joke and various individuals began to state that this was a political campaign and not
another beauty pageant. On the other hand Clinton was perceived as a "nut cracker" and "where boners go to die". Clinton's physical appearance and her choice of clothing, pantsuits over skirts and dresses, were the source of considerable ridicule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Carlin and Winfrey believe that Clinton was not perceived as a sex symbol because she chose to wear pants over
skirts, and also because she was older than Palin. Due to the smaller proportion of women who pursue political careers, there is greater pressure on female politicians to succeed. The importance of criticisms about "cankles" and the like on public popularity in a presidential election is disputed. Many think these criticisms are neglegible, but Carlin and Winfrey believe this criticisms have a large effect. This analysis done on both Senator Clinton's and Governor Palin's campaign concluded that media coverage had a vast responsibility on how both women were viewed due to their gender
stereotypes and language used to "influence the public",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though others argue that the style of media coverage is entirely the result of existing demand by the audience. There was national sample done that concluded that 51% of respondents ''believed'' that Americans were not ready for a women to be elected into high office.&lt;ref name="Lawless, J. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lawless | first = Jennifer L. | author-link = Jennifer L.

====== Nikki Haley ======
The ''New York Journal'' explains how many in the general public of South Carolina were ignorant of the fact that Haley was Indian-American. According to one of her co-workers in the state legislator, voters saw Haley as a “nice conservative woman with a tan.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1985149982?accountid=14665|title="For Nikki Haley, Dealing with Foreign Tyrants is the Easy Part of the Job."|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|website=New York Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While running the first time, for House of Representatives, in a semi-rural district, some of the voters pledged against Haley and said they would not vote for any candidate whose father was an immigrant. 

Throughout Haley’s 2010 campaign for Governor, opponents attacked her gender. These sexist comments did not sway Haley, who was self-confident in her own skin. She was called a “rag-head,” and “Mark Sandford in a skirt.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1985149982?accountid=14665|title="For Nikki Haley, Dealing with Foreign Tyrants is the Easy Part of the Job."|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|website=New York Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haley responded in a positive way, she was not upset and seemed very level-headed. Then, one person who worked with Haley previously as a political consultant accused her of an affair. Haley rejected this very serious allegation and went forward to win the 2010 election for Governor of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1985149982?accountid=14665|title="For Nikki Haley, Dealing With Foreign Tyrants Is the Easy Part of the Job."|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|website=New York Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in government have historically been fewer in numbers in [[Western world|Western societies]] compared to men.  Some women, however, have served as heads of state and government. Although the number of women in government in the US has grown, they still hold less than 25% of government positions nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genderwatch2018.org/getting-to-congress-women/|title=The hardest part of being a woman in Congress?

The results show that 60% of respondents have a baseline gender preference for a male candidate, while 40% prefer a woman candidate. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Kathleen|date=2009-05-22|title=The Impact of Gender Stereotyped Evaluations on Support for Women Candidates|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-009-9090-4|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=69–88|doi=10.1007/s11109-009-9090-4|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing women's integration into branches of government==

===Executive branch===
Women have been notably in fewer numbers in the executive branch of government.  The gender gap has been closing, however, albeit slowly&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"/&gt; The first women other than monarchs to hold head of state positions were in socialist countries. The first was [[Khertek Anchimaa-Toka]] of the [[Tuvan People's Republic]] from 1940–1944, followed by [[Sükhbaataryn Yanjmaa]] of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] 1953–1954 and [[Soong Ching-ling]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1968–1972 and 1981.

Following the socialist countries, the Nordic countries have been forerunners in including women in the executive branch. The [[second cabinet Brundtland]] (1986–1989) was historical in that 8 out of 18 cabinet members were women, and in 2007 the [[second cabinet Stoltenberg]] (2005–2013) was more than 50% women.

In 2003, Finland had a historical moment when all top leaders of the country were women and also represented different political parties: [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social democrat]] [[Tarja Halonen]] was President, [[Riitta Uosukainen]] from [[National Coalition Party]] was [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|Speaker of the Parliament]] and after the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary elections of 2003]] [[Anneli Jäätteenmäki]] from [[Centre Party (Finland)|Center party]] was on her way to become the first female [[Prime Minister of Finland]]. By June 22, 2010 [[Mari Kiviniemi]] of the Centre Party was appointed the second female [[Prime Minister of Finland]].

Between 2007 and 2011 the Finnish cabinet was 60% female, with a female Prime Minister from 2010 to 2011. Between 2014 and 2015 the Finnish cabinet was 59% female.

The present Danish government is a coalition between the Social Democrats, the Social-Liberal Party and the Socialist People's Party. All three parties have female leaders. [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] is Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Preisler | first = Marie | title = Denmark's gender equality policies: no quotas and a focus on men | journal = [[Nordic Labour Journal]] | publisher = [[Work Research Institute]] and [[Oslo and Akershus University College]] | date = March 8, 2013 | url = http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2013/equality-reaching-critical-mass/article.2013-03-08.2356410784 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female president]] was [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] of [[Iceland]], whose term lasted from 1980 to 1996.

In 2005, [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] of [[Liberia]] became Africa's first elected female head of state.

===Legislative branch===
It was not until World War I and the first socialist revolutions that the first few women became members of governments. [[Alexandra Kollontai]] became the first female to hold a minister position, as the People's Commissar for Social Welfare in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First female ministers | url = http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/First-female-ministers.htm | website = guide2womenleaders.com | publisher = Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nina Bang]], Danish Minister of Education from 1924–26, was the world's second full female cabinet minister.

The first female head of government was [[Evgenia Bosh]], the [[Bolshevik]] military leader who held the People's Secretary of Internal Affairs position in the Ukraine People's Republic of the Soviets of Workers and Peasants from 1917–1918, which was responsible for executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Woman Prime Ministers | url = http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/Premier_Ministers.htm | website = guide2womenleaders.com | publisher = Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ukraine | url = http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Ukraine.html | website = worldstatesmen.org | publisher = World Statesmen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Yevgenia Bosch (1879–1925) | url = http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=1261011&amp;cat_id=661258 | website = kmu.gov.ua | publisher = Government of Ukraine | language = Ukrainian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, development was slow and it was not until the end of the 20th century that female ministers stopped being unusual.

The first government organization formed with the goal of women's equality was the [[Zhenotdel]], in Soviet Russia.

According to a 2006 report by the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], 16% of all parliament members in the world are female. In 1995, the [[United Nations]] set a goal of 30% female representation.&lt;ref name="2006report"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Women politicians 'making gains' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4758036.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current annual growth rate of women in national parliaments is about 0.5% worldwide. At this rate, gender parity in national legislatures will not be achieved until 2068.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

The top ten countries in terms of number of female parliamentary members are [[Rwanda]] with 56.3%, [[Sweden]] (47.0%), [[Cuba]] (43.2%), [[Finland]] (41.5%), the [[Netherlands]] (41.3%), [[Argentina]] (40.0%), [[Denmark]] (38.0%), [[Angola]] (37.3%), [[Costa Rica]] (36.8%), [[Spain]] (36.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women in national parliaments | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/classif301108.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{As of|2008|08|30}} Cuba has the highest percentage for countries without a quota. In South Asia, Nepal is highest in the rank of women participation in politics with (33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209123905/http://sapint.org/ | archive-date = December 9, 2007 | url = http://www.sapint.org/ | website = sapint.or | publisher = South Asian Partnership }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[East Asian]] countries, [[Taiwan]] has the highest percentage of women in Parliament (38.0%). In the United States in 2008, the [[New Hampshire State Senate]] became the first state legislature upper house to possess an elected female majority.

The United Kingdom and United States are roughly in line with the world average. The [[House of Lords]] has 139 women (19.7%), while there are [[Women in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom|125 women]] (19.4%) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

On November 6, 2012, New Hampshire made US History by having all-female congressional delegation to Congress with [[Annie Kuster]] being elected to [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district|represent New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district]] in the House of Representatives, [[Carol Shea-Porter]] regained her House seat to represent [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] in the House of Representatives, and with [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and [[Kelly Ayotte]] both represented New Hampshire in the United States senate.&lt;ref&gt;New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2016, New Hampshire again made US History by having an all-female, all-[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] delegation to the US Congress. Incumbent Republican senator, Kelly Ayotte, was defeated by then-New Hampshire Governor, [[Maggie Hassan]], a Democrat, in the [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2016|senate election]] to serve alongside Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen. Representative Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, defeated incumbent representative, [[Frank Guinta]], a Republican, again in New Hampshire's 1st congressional district to serve alongside Ann Kuster, who represents New Hampshire 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives to achieve another historic "women's first".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-sending-first-all-woman-all-democratic-delegation-to-dc/8369972|title=New Hampshire Sending First All-Woman, All-Democratic Delegation to DC|first=Cam|last=Tranchemontagne|date=27 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local representation===
There has been an increasing focus on women's representation at a local level.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/&gt;  Most of this research is focused on developing countries.  Governmental decentralization often results in local government structures that are more open to the participation of women, both as elected local councilors and as the clients of local government services.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"/&gt;
A 2003 survey conducted by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), a global network supporting inclusive local governments, found that the average proportion of women in local council was 15%.  In leadership positions, the proportion of women was lower: for instance, 5% of mayors of Latin American municipalities are women.

According to a comparative study of women in local governments in East Asia and the Pacific, women have been more successful in reaching decision-making position in local governments than at the national level.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;  Local governments tend to be more accessible and have more available positions.  Also, women's role in local governments may be more accepted because they are seen as an extension of their involvement in the community.

====Indian panchayats====
The local panchayat system in India provides an example of women's representation at the local governmental level.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/&gt; The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments in 1992 mandated panchayat elections throughout the country.  The reforms reserved 33% of the seats for women and for castes and tribes proportional to their population.  Over 700,000 women were elected after the reforms were implemented in April 1993.
