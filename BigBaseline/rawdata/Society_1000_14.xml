      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10316">'''Agricultural philosophy''' (or '''philosophy of agriculture''') is, roughly and approximately, a discipline devoted to the systematic critique of the philosophical frameworks (or ethical world views) that are the foundation for decisions regarding agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;C. Taliaferro and S. Carpenter. (2010) "Farms" in ''Life Science Ethics.'' ed. Gary L. Comstock.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these views are also used to guide decisions dealing with land use in general. (Please see the Wikipedia article on [[environmental philosophy]].) In everyday usage, it can also be defined as the love of, search after, and wisdom associated with agriculture, as one of humanity's founding components of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lindsay Falvey]] (2005) Religion and Agriculture: Sustainability in Christianity and Buddhism. c.350pp. [[Institute for International Development]], Adelaide and Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is more aptly known as [[agrarianism]]. In actuality, agrarianism is only one philosophy or normative framework out of many that people use to guide their decisions regarding agriculture on an everyday basis. The most prevalent of these philosophies will be briefly defined below.

==Utilitarian approach==
This view was first put forth by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Though there are many varieties of [[utilitarianism]], generally the view is that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/ History of Utilitarianism]&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is a form of [[consequentialism]]; which basically means that the correct action is understood entirely in terms of the consequences of that action. Utilitarianism is often used when deciding farming issues. For example, farmland is commonly valued based upon its capacity to the grow crops that people want. This approach to valuing land is called Asset Theory (in contrast to Location Theory) and it is based upon utilitarian principles. Another example is when a community decides on what to do with a particular parcel of land. Let's say that this community must decide to use it for industry, residential uses, or for farming. By using a utilitarian approach, the council would judge which use would benefit the greatest number of people in the community and then make their choice based upon that information. Finally, it also forms the foundation for industrial farming; as an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. Indeed, a common argument in favor of [[industrial agriculture]] is this it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices.&lt;ref&gt;Conkin, Paul. (2009) ''Revolution Down on the Farm: The Transformation of American Agriculture since 1929.'' Raleigh: The University of Kentucky Press; Kingsolver, Barbara. (2007)''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life.'' New York: HarperCollins Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, several scholars and writers, such as [[Peter Singer]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], and [[Wendell Berry]] have argued against this view. For example, Singer argues that the suffering of animals (farm animals included) should be included in the cost/benefit calculus when deciding whether or not to do an action such as industrial farming.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. (2002) ''Animal Liberation.'' New York: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been challenged on the grounds that farmland and farm animals are instrumentalized in this view and not valued in and of themselves.&lt;ref name="publishing1"&gt;Thompson, Paul. (2010) "Land." "Life Science Ethics." ed. Gary L. Comstock. Raleigh: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, systems thinkers, deep ecologists, and agrarian philosophers (such as [[Aldo Leopold]] &amp; [[Wendell Berry]]) critique this view on the grounds that it ignores aspects of farming which are morally applicable and/or intrinsically valuable.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. (1948) ''A Sand County Almanac.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press; Berry, Wendell. (2002) ''The Art of the Commonplace: The Agrarian Essays of Wendell Berry.'' Berkeley: Counterpoint Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Slow Food Movement]] and the Buy Local Agricultural Movements are also built upon philosophical views morally opposed to extreme versions of this approach. Other critiques will be explored below when different philosophical approaches to agriculture are briefly explained. However, it is important to note that the Utilitarian approach to agriculture is currently the most widespread approach within the modern Western World.

==Libertarian approach==

Another philosophical approach often used when deciding land or farming issues is [[Libertarianism]]. Libertarianism is, roughly, the moral view that agents own themselves and have certain moral rights including the right to acquire property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/libertarianism/ Vallentyne, Peter, "Libertarianism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; In a looser sense, Libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each person has a right to a maximum amount of liberty when this liberty does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well known Libertarian theorist is [[John Hospers]]. Within this view, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for a farmer to inefficiently farm their land as long as they don't harm others while doing it. In 1968, Garrett Harden applied this philosophy to land/farming issues when he argued that the only solution to the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, Garrett. (1968) "The Tragedy of the Commons." Science, 162, 1243-1248&lt;/ref&gt; He then supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument and, indeed, you could argue that Libertarianism is rooted in utilitarian ideals. However, this leaves Libertarian based land ethics open to the above critiques lodged against Utilitarian approaches to agriculture. Even excepting these critiques, the Libertarian view has been specifically challenged by the critique that people making self-interested decisions can cause large ecological and social disasters such as the [[Dust Bowl]] disaster.&lt;ref name="publishing1"/&gt; Even so, it is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, by U.S. ranchers and farmers.

==Egalitarian approach==

Egalitarian based views are often developed as a response to Libertarianism. This is because, while Libertarianism provides for the maximum amount of human freedom, it does not require a person to help others. In addition, it also leads to the grossly uneven distribution of wealth. A well known Egalitarian philosopher is [[John Rawls]]. When focusing on agriculture, what this translates into is the uneven distribution of land and food.&lt;ref name="publishing1"/&gt; While both Utilitarian and Libertarian approaches to agriculture ethics could conceivably rationalize this mal-distribution, an Egalitarian approach typically favors equality whether that be equal entitlement and/or opportunity to employment or access to food.&lt;ref&gt;Arneson, Richard, "Egalitarianism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/egalitarianism/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, if you recognize that people have a right to something, then someone has to supply this opportunity or item; whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, the Egalitarian view links land and water with the right to food. With the growth of human populations and the decline of soil and water resources, Egalitarianism could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water.&lt;ref name="publishing1"/&gt;

==Ecological or systems approach==

In addition to Utilitarian, Libertarian, and Egalitarian philosophies, there are also normative views that are based upon the principle that land has intrinsic value and positions coming out of an ecological or systems view. Two main examples of this are [[James Lovelock]]'s [[Gaia hypothesis]] which postulates that the Earth is an organism&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James (2009). The Vanishing Face of Gaia: A Final Warning: Enjoy It While You Can. Allen Lane. {{ISBN|978-1-84614-185-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[deep ecology|deep ecologists]] who argue that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities.&lt;ref&gt;Naess, Arne (1973) 'The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement.' Inquiry 16: 95-100&lt;/ref&gt; While the above philosophies can be useful for guiding decision making on issues concerning land in general, they have limited usefulness when applied to agriculture because these philosophies privilege natural ecosystems and agricultural ecosystems are often considered not natural. One philosophy grounded in the principle that land has intrinsic value which is directly applicable to agriculture is [[Aldo Leopold]]'s stewardship ethic or [[land ethic]].&lt;ref name="university1948"&gt;Leopold, A. (1948) A Sand County Almanac. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; For Leopold, an action is correct if it tends to "preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community".&lt;ref name="university1948"/&gt; Similar to Egalitarian-based land ethics, many of the above philosophies were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian based approaches. Leopold's ethic is currently one of the most popular ecological approaches to agriculture commonly known as [[agrarianism]]. Other agrarianists include [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur]] (1735–1813), [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882), [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862), [[John Steinbeck]] (1902–1968), [[Wendell Berry]] (b. 1934), [[Gene Logsdon]] (b. 1932), [[Paul B. Thompson (philosopher)|Paul B. Thompson]], and [[Barbara Kingsolver]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3898">An '''Aonach''' or '''Óenach''' was an ancient [[Ireland|Irish]] public national assembly called upon the death of a [[king]], [[Queen regnant|queen]], notable [[Wise old man|sage]] or [[warrior]] as part of [[ancestor worship]] practices.&lt;ref name="Nally2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. H. Nally|title=The Aonac Tailteann and the Tailteann Games Their History and Ancient Associations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SObPJ02EiwMC|accessdate=31 July 2012|date=30 June 2008|publisher=Jesson Press|isbn=978-1-4097-8189-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the entertainment, the óenach was an occasion on which kings and notables met under [[truce]] and where [[law]]s were pronounced and confirmed.

The Aonach had three functions; honoring the dead, proclaiming [[law]]s, and funeral games and festivities to entertain. The first function took between one and three days depending on the importance of the deceased, guests would sing mourning chants called the ''[[Guba (chant)|Guba]]'' after which [[druid]]s would improvise songs in memory of the dead called a ''[[Cepóg]]''. The dead would then be burnt on a [[funeral pyre]]. The second function would then be carried out by the [[Ollamh Érenn]], giving out laws to the people via bards and druids and culminating in the igniting of another massive fire. The custom of rejoicing after a funeral was then enshrined in the ''[[Cuiteach Fuait]]'', games of mental and physical ability accompanied by a large market for traders. 

The most notable fair, that held under the auspices of the [[High King of Ireland]] and the [[Uí Néill]], was the ''Óenach Tailten'' or "[[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]]", which is given [[prehistoric]] origins by medieval writers. This was held at [[Teltown]], in modern [[County Meath]], as late as 1770. The compilers of the [[Irish annals]] considered violence and disorders at this óenach, or the failure of the incumbent High King to hold the fair, to be of note. The [[Irish Free State]] held [[Tailteann Games (Irish Free State)|revivals of the Tailteann Games]] from 1924 to 1932. 

Other important assemblies included that of [[Tlachtga]], held on the [[Hill of Ward]] at [[Samhain]], that of [[Carman]], held in [[County Wexford]], that of [[Uisnech]], held at [[Beltane]] and that of Raigne in [[Kingdom of Ossory|Osraige]]. Not all had pagan calendrical associations. The ''Óenach Colmáin'', probably held at [[Lynally]], was named for Saint [[Elo Colman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12163">[[File:Enfantin.png|thumb|right|Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin (1796–1864)]]
'''Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin''' (8 February 1796{{snd}}1 September 1864) was a [[France|French]] [[Reform movement|social reformer]], one of the founders of [[Saint-Simonianism]]. He was also a proponent of a [[Suez canal]].

== Early life ==
Enfantin was born in [[Paris]], the son of a banker of [[Dauphiné]]. After receiving his early education at a [[lyceum]], he was sent in 1813 to the [[École polytechnique]]. In March 1814 he was one of the band of students who, on the heights of [[Montmartre]] and [[Saint-Chaumont]], attempted resistance to the armies of the [[Sixth Coalition]] which had engaged in the invasion of Paris. In consequence of this outbreak of [[Patriotism|patriotic]] enthusiasm, the school was soon after closed by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], and the young student was compelled to seek another career.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

Initially, he began working for a country wine merchant, travelling to [[German Confederation|Germany]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. In 1821 he entered a banking-house newly established at [[Saint Petersburg]], but returned two years later to Paris, where he was appointed [[cashier]] to the ''[[Caisse Hypothécaire]]''. At the same time, he became a member of the [[secret society]] of the ''[[Carbonari]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

In 1825 a new turn was given to his thoughts and his life by the friendship which he formed with [[Olinde Rodriguez]], who introduced him to the [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Comte de Saint-Simon]]. He affiliated to Saint-Simon's version of [[utopian socialism]], and, by 1829, he had become one of the acknowledged heads of the [[Sectarianism|sect]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

== Preaching and politics ==
After the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 Enfantin resigned his office of cashier, and devoted all his energy to the cause. Besides contributing to ''[[Le Globe]]'', he made appeals to the people by systematic [[Sermon|preaching]], and organized centres of action in some of the main cities of France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

The headquarters in Paris were moved from the modest rooms in the Rue Taranne to the large halls near the [[Boulevard des Italiens]]. Enfantin and [[Amand Bazard]] were proclaimed ''Pères Suprêmes'' ("Supreme Fathers") – a union which was, however, only nominal, as a divergence was already manifest. Bazard, who concentrated on organizing the group, had devoted himself to political reform, while Enfantin, who favoured teaching and preaching, dedicated his time to social and moral change. The antagonism was widened by Enfantin's announcement of his theory of the relation of man and woman, which would substitute a system of "[[free love]]" for the "tyranny of [[marriage]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

Bazard and his disciples broke with Enfantin's group. The latter became sole "father", leading a chiefly religiously-oriented movement, joined by new converts (according to Enfantin's estimate, the total number of followers would have reached 40,000). He wore on his breast a badge with his title of ''Père'', was referred to by his preachers as "the living law", declared himself to be the [[Messiah|chosen of God]], and sent out emissaries in a quest of a woman predestined to be the "female Messiah," and the mother of a new [[Salvation|Saviour]] (the latter quest was very costly and altogether fruitless).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

== Success and repression ==
Meanwhile, the new religion gathered believers in all parts of [[Europe]]. His extravagances and success at length brought him to the attention of authorities, who argued that he was endangering [[public morality]] - Enfantin had announced that the gulf between the sexes was too wide and this social inequality would impede rapid growth of society. Enfantin called for the abolition of prostitution and for the ability for women to divorce and obtain legal rights. This was considered radical for the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=29|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1832 the halls of the new sect were closed by the government, and the ''Père'', with some of his followers, appeared before the tribunals. He then retired to his estate at [[Menilmontant]], near Paris, where with forty disciples, all of them men, he continued to carry out his socialist views. In August of the same year he was again arrested, and on his appearance in court he desired his defence to be undertaken by two women who were with him, alleging that the matter was of special concern to women; the request was promptly refused. The trial occupied two days and resulted in a verdict of guilty, and a sentence of imprisonment for a year with a small fine.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

This prosecution discredited the new society. Enfantin was released in a few months.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}} 

==Turkey and Egypt==
Then, accompanied by twenty of his followers, many of whom were also engineers from the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], including [[:fr:Charles Joseph Lambert|Charles Joseph Lambert]], also known as Lambert-Bey, and some women, he went first to [[Constantinople]]. Enfantin had declared 1933 the Year of the Mother, and upon arrival in Constantinople the group began to strongly preach their views about gender relations and New Christianity. The [[Ottoman Empire]] told them to leave to avoid prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=31|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enfantin and his group then arrived in [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egypt]], where he planned to penetrate the feminine [[Orient]] with the masculine [[Occident]] in a consumation of progression - build a canal connecting the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[Red Sea]]. In Egypt at that time, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], the Egyptian Viceroy, was at odds with the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, and also practiced public-private contracts known as concessions with mostly European companies to build cheap infrastructure. Ali did not agree to a project linking the two seas because he did not want to cut out the duties he collected from overland trade in Egypt, but did allow Enfantin's group to work on the [[Delta Barrage]] - a type of [[Barrage (dam)|dam]] - north of [[Cairo]] - with unpaid laborers - that would act to limit Nile flooding and create predictable crop yields. During his time in Egypt, Enfantine also established technical schools based on the Ecole Polytechnique model with Ali's blessing. Also in Egypt he encountered and influenced [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. Enfantine returned to France in 1836, lacking the patience to finish the Nile barrage project that was encountering delays.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|pp=31-37|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to France ==
[[File:Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin.jpg|thumb|left]]
On his return to France, he occupied minor offices. He became first a [[postmaster]] near [[Lyon]], and in 1841 was appointed, through the influence of some of his friends who had risen to posts of power, member of a scientific commission on [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], which led him to engage in researches concerning [[North Africa]] and [[French colonial empires|colonization]] in general.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=402-403}}

In 1845 he was appointed a director of the Paris &amp; Lyons [[Rail transport|railway]]. Three years later he established, in conjunction with Duveyrier, a daily journal, entitled ''Le Credit'', which was discontinued in 1850. He was afterwards attached to the administration of the railway from Lyons to the Mediterranean. 

==Société d'Études du Canal de Suez==
Father Enfantin held fast by his ideal to the end, but he had renounced the hope of giving it a local habitation and a name in the degenerate obstinate world. His personal influence over those who associated with him was immense. "He was a man of a noble presence, with finely formed and expressive features. He was gentle and insinuating in manner, and possessed a calm, graceful and winning delivery" (''Gent. M .'' Jan. 1865). His evident sincerity, his genuine enthusiasm, gave him his marvellous ascendancy. The [[Société d'Études du Canal de Suez]] was established by Enfantin in 1846 to continue study of the Suez Canal. Its members included [[François Barthélemy Arlès-Dufour|Arlès-Dufour]], Jules, Lon and [[Paulin Talabot]], the British [[Robert Stephenson]] and Edward Starbuck, the Austrian [[Alois Negrelli]], inspector of the [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway]], and Feronce and Sellier of Leipzig as representatives of the German interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/suezcanal032262mbp Wilson, Arnold T. (1939). ''The Suez Canal''. 2nd ed., London: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Société sent surveying teams to Egypt, developed engineering plans, determined that the elevation difference between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea was negligible, but Muhammad Ali was still reticent to the idea of a canal. Upon his death in 1848, the activities of the Société were minimized until his successor was assassinated in 1854 and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] took up the initiative to build a canal. Lessups had corresponded at least once with the Société in the intervening years and had known the new Egyptian viceroy, [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id]], when he was a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

Amongst his works are: ''Doctrine de Saint-Simon'' (written in conjunction with several of his followers), published in 1830, and several times republished; ''Economie politique et politique Saint-Simonienne'' (1831); ''{{lang|fr|Correspondance politique}}'' (1835–1840); ''Corresp. philos. et religieuse'' (1843–1845); and ''La Vie eternelle passee, presente, future'' (1861). A large number of articles by his hand appeared in ''Le Producteur'', ''L'Organisateur'', ''[[Le Globe]]'', and other periodicals. He also wrote in 1832 ''Le Livre nouveau'', intended as a substitute for the Christian Scriptures, but it was not published.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=403}}

A '''coffeehouse''' is a [[social]] event, often held to raise funds for and/or generate [[awareness]] of a social cause or other event.

The name "coffeehouse" is derived from the limited menu which is typically available at the social event: [[coffee]] is usually the featured beverage, together with other non-alcoholic beverages such as [[Soft drink|soda]], juice and [[tea]]. Desserts and snack foods may round out the menu.

[[Folk music]] and other acoustic concerts are the primary activity at many coffee houses.  Other coffeehouses allow patrons to sing, dance, read poetry, perform stand-up comedy, or demonstrate other talents as entertainment during the event.&lt;ref&gt;Harrisburg Horizons Newspaper Article "A Cup of Cheer"&lt;/ref&gt;  Still other coffeehouses feature lectures and presentations to raise awareness about social issues such as [[political repression|political oppression]], food/[[freshwater]] shortages, and/or outbreaks of [[disease]] in various countries. Some coffeehouses may facilitate other activities such as a mass letter writing campaign or signing petitions.

Some coffeehouses have free admission, but others require a small entrance fee. If money is collected as an entrance fee, it is often donated in whole or in part to the social cause, after covering expenses.

Coffeehouses are often sponsored by a permanent, semi-commercial [[coffeehouse]] venue, such as the well-known [[Club Passim]] and [[Caffe Lena]]. Churches, non-profits, school groups, and other private groups also sponsor coffee houses in church meeting rooms, [[college]]s, and [[high school]]s. In particular, schools often sponsor coffeehouses to allow students to socialize in an explicitly non-alcoholic environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1366">The '''Committee on the Public Understanding of Science''' or '''Copus''' was founded in 1985 by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] (BAAS), the [[Royal Institution]] and the [[Royal Society]]. Its aim was to interpret scientific advances and make them more accessible to non-scientists.

It played a part in developing the [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]] it establishing standards for communicating science and technology

The Copus Grant Schemes was set up in 1987 and the last round of grants was for 2003/4. The scheme was funded by the [[Office of Science and Technology]] and the [[Royal Society]]. 25 grants worth a total of over £750,000 were awarded in 2003/2004.

In 2000 The new Copus Council was formed to be a more inclusive partnership for science communication in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 following a report commissioned by the [[Office of Science and Technology]] the Copus Council was discontinued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32140">'''Consequential strangers''' are personal connections other than family and close friends. Also known as "peripheral" or "weak" ties, they lie in the broad social territory between [[stranger]]s and intimates. The term was coined by Karen L. Fingerman and further developed by Melinda Blau, who collaborated with the psychologist to explore and popularize the concept.&lt;ref name="Fingerman2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=Karen L. |last=Fingerman |chapter=Consequential Strangers: Peripheral Ties Across the Lifespan |editor-first=F. R. |editor-last=Lang |editor2-first=K. L. |editor2-last=Fingerman |title=Growing Together: Personal Relationships Across the Lifespan |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-521-81310-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BlauFingerman2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=Melinda |last=Blau |first2=Karen L. |last2=Fingerman |title=Consequential Strangers: The Power of People Who Don't Seem to Matter...But Really Do |location=New York |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-393-06703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social life in the 21st century includes a wide array of personal connections, not just intimates—people associated with a particular part of one’s life and daily activities, such as co-workers, neighbors, gym buddies, fellow volunteers and congregants, and providers of goods and services.  Typically, peripheral ties far outnumber one’s close relations.  Decades of research have shown the importance of primary relationships in both psychological and physiological well being.  Yet an analysis of the broader social landscape suggests that consequential strangers provide many of the same benefits as intimates as well as many distinct and complementary functions.  They are not universally beneficial—undesirable consequential strangers who cannot be avoided can be found in the workplace, neighborhoods and organizations. But to thrive in a modern society, research suggests, it is vital to have a variety of connections.&lt;ref name="Fingerman2009"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Karen L. |last=Fingerman |title=Consequential Strangers and Peripheral Partners: The Importance of Unimportant Relationships |journal=Journal of Family Theory and Review |volume=1 |year=2009 |issue=2 |pages=69–82 |doi=10.1111/j.1756-2589.2009.00010.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The academic underpinnings of the concept can be traced back to [[Mark Granovetter]]’s influential 1973 paper, "The Strength of Weak Ties," in which the sociologist argued that job opportunities were most likely to come from people in the more distant reaches of one’s personal network—old bosses, former coworkers, college connections.&lt;ref name="Granovetter1973"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark |last=Granovetter |title=The Strength of Weak Ties |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=78 |year=1973 |issue=6 |pages=1360–1380 |jstor=2776392 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent studies of [[social networks]] have shown that information, resources, and new connections—which confer [[social capital]]—are the province of weak ties in all arenas of life, not just employment.  Benefits accrue to individuals, families, and the larger community as well.&lt;ref name="Lin2001"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nan |last=Lin |title=Social Capital: a Theory of Social Structure and Action |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-47431-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one study found that African American mothers who made use of community ties as well as their families, were able to get their children into magnet schools and extracurricular programs that protected them from the dangers of inner city life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robin L. |last=Jarrett |title=Successful Parenting in High-Risk Neighborhoods |journal=The Future of Children |volume=9 |year=1999 |issue=2 |pages=45–50 |jstor=1602704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, relationship scholars have concentrated almost entirely on intimates: partners, children, parents, and, to a lesser extent, best friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Karen L. |last=Fingerman |first2=Elizabeth L. |last2=Hay |title=Searching under the Streetlight? Age Biases in the Personal and Family Relationships Literature |journal=Personal Relationships |volume=9 |year=2002 |issue=4 |pages=415–433 |doi=10.1111/1475-6811.09404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the trend toward [[urbanization]] underscored the importance of peripheral relationships. It is almost impossible to cope with the demands of modern life without weak ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Giddens |authorlink=Anthony Giddens |title=The Consequences of Modernity |location=Stanford, CA |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-8047-1762-1 }} Inspired some social scientists to reconsider this bias further.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, over the last several decades a handful of researchers and theorists have emphasized the important role of weak ties in anchoring individuals in the larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Calvin |last=Morrill |first2=David A. |last2=Snow |chapter=The Study of Personal Relationships in Public Places |title=Alone Together: Personal Relationships in Public Places |editor-first=Calvin |editor-last=Morrill |editor2-first=David A. |editor2-last=Snow |editor3-first=Cindy H. |editor3-last=White |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=University of California Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-520-24522-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lofland1995"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lyn H. |last=Lofland |chapter=Social Interaction: Continuities and Complexities in the Study of Nonintimate Sociality |title=Sociological Perspectives on Social Psychology |editor-first=K.

S. |editor3-last=House |location=Boston |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=1995 |isbn=0-205-13716-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As one scholar observed in 1989, "Social scientists have long held that close and intimate friendships are the ''sine qua non'' of personal relationships, and no doubt they are important, but ties with acquaintances are equally important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Milardo |title=Theoretical and Methodological Issues in the Identification of the Social Networks of Spouses |journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family |volume=51 |year=1989 |issue=1 |pages=165–174 |jstor=352377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology has played a key role in the unprecedented rise of consequential strangers.  Advances in transportation and communication have always altered the ways in which people can connect—the pony express allowed the printed word to spread; the telephone made it possible to speak to distant contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. G. |last=Adams |first2=M. L. |last2=Stevenson |chapter=A Lifetime of Relationships Mediated by Technology |title=Growing Together: Personal Relationships Across the Lifespan |editor-first=F. R. |editor-last=Lang |editor2-first=K. L. |editor2-last=Fingerman |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-521-81310-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But computers and digitalization have accelerated the process. In 1997, when Merrill Lynch asked social observer Michael Schrage to analyze how "new" technologies would transform  businesses, he stressed that the shift did not herald an "information revolution" as much as a "relationship revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Schrage |title=The Relationship Revolution |work=Merrill Lynch Forum |year=1997 |url=http://www.cooperationcommons.com/node/406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His predictions proved prescient. Today, at least 1.6 billion people are connected via computer and mobile devices.  Various social media, such as blogs, wikis, Twitter, SMS, and networking sites like Facebook facilitate contact, coordination, and collaboration across boundaries of time and space—and at minimal cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joshua-Michele |last=Ross |title=The Rise of the Social Nervous System |work=forbes.com |date=March 9, 2009 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/03/09/internet-innovations-hive-technology-breakthroughs-innovations.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most relationships—personal and business—are now conducted both on and off the Internet.&lt;ref name="Wellman2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry |last=Wellman |chapter=Personal Relationships: On and Off the Internet |title=The Cambridge Handbook of Personal Relations |editor-first=Anita L. |editor-last=Vangelisti |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Perlman |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-521-82617-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the ranks of consequential strangers have grown as has the ability to keep in touch with them.

==Definition==

Consequential strangers comprise the aggregate of personal connections outside one’s inner circles of family and close friends.  Such relationship are referred to elsewhere as "peripheral" (versus "core"), "secondary" (versus "primary"), or "weak ties" (versus "strong").&lt;ref name="Fingerman2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lofland1995" /&gt; Colloquially, they are also known as acquaintances.  But in reality, relationships cannot be neatly classified into groups.  Rather, they fall along a continuum.  Consequential strangers occupy the vast territory between strangers and close (or core) ties.  They are just beyond Stanley Milgrim’s conception of a [[familiar stranger]]—one frequently encountered and broadly identifiable (a woman, an Asian, a cop)—but not known in the personal sense. In contrast, a personal and repeated pattern of interaction is evident with a consequential stranger.&lt;ref name="BlauFingerman2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fingerman2009" /&gt;

The field of consequential strangers encompasses a diverse assortment of relationship types. The gradations between weak ties are often blurred, among other reasons because all relationships are fluid and dynamic. Over time, some consequential stranger connections become close friends or even intimate partners, while others stay at the level of acquaintanceship—for example, those "anchored" to a particular place, such as a school, gym, or train station or involved in a paid service or status hierarchies (e.g., a boss and worker).

Also, the vocabulary of relationships can be confusing. Whereas some languages, such as French, have two forms of the pronoun "you"—using the informal ''tu'' with intimates and the formal ''vous'' with acquaintances—English has no such markers.  The word "friend" is used to describe close ''and'' casual relations. One must inquire further to find out what the speaker means.&lt;ref name="Fingerman2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Claude |last=Fischer |title=What Do We Mean by ‘Friend’? An Inductive Study |journal=Social Network |volume=3 |year=1982 |issue=4 |pages=287–306 |doi=10.1016/0378-8733(82)90004-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, "acquaintance" can be defined either as a relationship that falls short of friendship or as a stage from which the relationship becomes more intimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ray |last=Pahl |first2=Liz |last2=Spencer |title=Rethinking Friendship: Hidden Solidarities Today |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-691-12742-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology further complicates the linguistic issue. For example, Japanese sociologist Hidenori Tomita coined the term "intimate stranger"—a person with whom one shares intimate and yet anonymous contact—to describe "new relationships born through the new media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hidenori |last=Tomita |chapter=Keitai and the Intimate Stranger |title=Personal, Portable, Pedestrian: Mobile Phones in Japanese Life |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Ito |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Matsuda |editor3-first=D. |editor3-last=Okabe |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-262-09039-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From strangers to intimates: relationship development==

Social scientists in the seventies observed that in order for a relationship to develop into increasing intimacy, the social partners need opportunities to get together, time with one another, and a certain degree of privacy (optimum group size for developing intimacy is small).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=U. G. |last=Foa |first2=E. B. |last2=Foa |title=Societal Structures of the Mind |location=Springfield, IL |publisher=Charles C. Thomas |year=1974 |isbn=0-398-02932-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent conceptualizations extend that premise, theorizing that a relationship is more than the sum of two people.  Environmental, historical, and cultural factors also impinge on the course of a given relationship. Among factors cited are the partners’  other social ties, their respective positions in the life cycle, the era in which the two are embedded, and the place—home, community, country—where their liaison unfolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara B. |last=Brown |first2=Carl M. |last2=Werner |first3=Irwin |last3=Altman |chapter=Relationships in Home and Community Environments: A Transactional and Dialectic Analysis |title=The Cambridge Handbook of Personal Relationships |editor1-first=Anita L. |editor1-last=Vangelisti |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |pages=673–693 |isbn=0-521-82617-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, "getting together" nowadays often occurs in virtual, not real, space.&lt;ref name="Wellman2006" /&gt;

The "closest" peripheral ties involve mutual recognition and repeated interactions (in one another’s physical presence or online). A treasured accountant or a cherished priest might be among one’s closest consequential strangers.   At the other extreme are relationships that are barely blips on the social radar, such as people with adjoining season seats for a game or same-time-next-year conventioneers.&lt;ref name="BlauFingerman2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fingerman2009" /&gt;

Another factor that shapes a relationship is the level of investment and stability.  People are committed to their intimates, less so to their consequential strangers. If one's tennis partner moves or the owner of a favorite deli retires, such individuals might be missed, but others will fill their roles.   Also, weak ties often serve compartmentalized needs—for a particular kind of assistance, a leisure activity, a work project—whereas intimates are more likely to serve multiple functions.&lt;ref name="Granovetter1973" /&gt;

Self-disclosure—both ''breadth'' (the variety of subjects discussed) and ''depth'' (the degree of intimate sharing)—is the engine that drives all relationships. As a rule of thumb, the closer the relationship, the more time spent together, the more likely that social partners will self-disclose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark L. |last=Knapp |first2=Anita L. |last2=Vangelisti |title=Interpersonal Communication and Human Relationships |edition=Fifth |location=Boston |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=2005 |isbn=0-205-41493-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in all relationships, social partners strike a balance between a need to connect and a need for one’s own space.  At different times of day, at different times of life, and at different points in history, people are more or less open to disclosing information about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Irwin |last=Altman |first2=Anne |last2=Vinsel |first3=Barbara B. |last3=Brown |chapter=Dialectic Conceptions in Social Psychology: An Application to Social Penetration and Privacy Regulation |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |editor-first=L. |editor-last=Berkowitz |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-12-015222-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even within a long-term relationship, partners do not always share with one another on a deep level. Thus, although lovers and best friends may be the ''likely'' recipients of confidences, they are rarely the only ones.  Individuals also confide in their consequential strangers, particularly those near the intimate end of the continuum.  Studies have shown, for example, that this happens frequently with certain professionals—among them, hairdressers and divorce lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Emory L. |last=Cowen |title=Help Is Where You find It |journal=American Psychologist |volume=37 |year=1982 |issue=4 |pages=385–395 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.37.4.385 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, gym buddies and frequent patrons at diners often share confidences with one another. In part it's the regularity of contact, in part the place itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jamie |last=Heller |title=So Close...and So Separate |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 21, 2006 |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB116077074014592238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony M. |last=Orum |title=All the World’s a Coffee Shop: Reflections on Place, Identity and Community |journal=Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture: Rhetorics of Place |volume=5 |year=2005 |url=http://reconstruction.eserver.org/053/orum.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714180411/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/053/orum.shtml |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain conditions, [[Zick Rubin]] found that people even share with complete strangers, a paradox known as the "stranger on a train" phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Zick |last=Rubin |title=Disclosing Oneself to a Stranger: Reciprocity and Its Limits |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=11 |year=1975 |issue=3 |pages=233–260 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(75)80025-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and drawbacks==

Numerous studies underscore the importance of intimate relationships—and nothing in the conceptualization of consequential strangers disputes this.  However, weak ties can be similar to, different from, and supportive of close relations.&lt;ref name="Fingerman2009" /&gt; Indeed, consequential strangers can provide many of the same benefits to individuals as do close relationships: companionship, a sense of belonging, and emotional support, particularly in times of crisis or emergency.

Because relationships mirror different aspects of the self, both weak and strong ties contribute to an individual’s sense of identity.  In some situations, consequential strangers may allow distinct facets of identity to emerge. For example, women over fifty who join the [[Red Hat Society]] tend to express aspects of themselves in the company of other "Hatters" that would surprise members of their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sue Ellen |last=Cooper |title=The Red Hat Society: Fun and Friendship After Fifty |location=New York |publisher=Warner Books |year=2004 |isbn=0-446-67976-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also suggests that one can develop a greater sense of agency and mastery by stepping into multiple roles.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy A. Thoits, "Personal Agency in the Accumulation of Role-Identities," presented at The Future of Identity Theory and Research: A Guide for a New Century Conference University of Indiana, Bloomington, IN, April, 2001: 179-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Being with one’s poker buddies requires a different skill set than volunteering at the local hospital or conducting a meeting at work. And because of the lack of familiarity in these various situations, it is necessary to communicate in more "elaborated" patterns of speech with consequential strangers than with loved ones. Relating to assorted others forces an individual to "negotiate, exercise judgment, reconcile, compromise, and take account of the intentions, purposes, motivations, and perspective" of his or her assorted role partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rose Laub |last=Coser |title=In Defense of Modernity: Role Complexity and Individual Autonomy |location=Palo Alto, CA |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-8047-1871-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weak ties also provide benefits not available in close ties: information, resources, and novelty, as well as a sense of being "known" in the larger community.  Consequential strangers often act as "bridges" to new people and groups.&lt;ref name="Burt1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald S. |last=Burt |title=Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-674-84372-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through them, an individual is exposed to ideas, cultures, life strategies, and diversions that are beyond the scope of their loved ones' knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Lin2001" /&gt;

Casual connections provide fodder for social comparison—a psychological process in which one regards another’s circumstances and feels better or worse off.  In certain situations, downward comparison (feeling better than) may contribute to self-esteem. One study found that college students tend to view friends as comparable to themselves, but make downward comparisons with acquaintances. Viewing oneself as better than a close partner might jeopardize the relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ladd |last=Wheeler |first2=Kunitate |last2=Miyake |title=Social Comparison in Everyday Life |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=62 |year=1992 |issue=5 |pages=760–773 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.62.5.760 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequential strangers can also support intimate ties, especially in the family.  In a given day, parents deal with child care providers, teachers, coaches, and other parents who can offer  tangible aid, such as car pools, information about school policies, as well as emotional support to the family.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Milardo, H. M. Helms, &amp; S. R. Marks, "Social Capitalization in Personal Relationships," paper presented at the Theory Construction and Research Methodology Workshop, the annual meeting of the National Council on Family, 2005. Phoenix, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Many peripheral relationships are satisfying, although some are also the cause of daily hassles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. L. |last=Fingerman |first2=E. L. |last2=Hay |first3=K. S. |last3=Birditt |title=The Best of Ties, the Worst of Ties: Close, Problematic, and Ambivalent Relationships Across the Lifespan |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=66 |year=2004 |issue=3 |pages=792–808 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-2445.2004.00053.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a weak tie is bothersome, one can often walk away. However, there are certain consequential strangers from whom escape is impossible—a coworker, neighbor, or teacher that rankles.

Another study suggests that lying may be more frequent between consequential strangers than between intimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bella M. |last=DePaulo |first2=Deborah A. |last2=Kashy |title=Everyday Lies in Close and Casual Relationships |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=74 |year=1998 |issue=1 |pages=63–79 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gossip, particularly among a closed system of colleagues or neighbors, spreads quickly among weak ties as well.&lt;ref name="Burt1992" /&gt;

Aggression in the workplace—an arena filled mostly with consequential strangers rather than close friends—is also well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Loraleigh |last=Keashly |first2=Joel H. |last2=Neuman |title=Bullying in the Workplace: Its Impact and Management |journal=Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal |volume=8 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=335–373 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have even linked increases in blood pressure to the experience of working for an unfavorable supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=N. |last=Wager |first2=G. |last2=Fieldman |first3=T. |last3=Hussey |title=The effect on ambulatory blood pressure of working under favourably and unfavourably perceived supervisors |journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=60 |year=2003 |issue=7 |pages=468–474 |doi=10.1136/oem.60.7.468 |pmc=1740583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A vast literature regarding work and family further suggests that difficulties with co-workers can reverberate at home in the form of anger or withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rena L. |last=Repetti |title=Short-Term Effects of Occupational Stressors on Daily Mood and Health Complaints |journal=Health Psychology |volume=12 |year=1993 |issue=2 |pages=125–131 |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.12.2.125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The network view==

Another way to view the impact of consequential strangers is by pulling the camera back from the individual to the entire network.  Each individual travels through life in what was first conceptualized in the 1980s as a "social convoy"—an entourage of people that he or she has collected along the way. This assortment of personal ties is one type of [[social network]].Some individuals are better or less equipped for life's challenges and crises, not merely because of their strength or socio-economic status, but also because of the composition of their convoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Kahn |first2=Toni |last2=Antonucci |chapter=Convoys over the Life Course: Attachment, Roles, and Social Support |title=Life-Span Development and Behavior |editor1-first=P. B. |editor1-last=Baltes |editor2-first=O. |editor2-last=Brim |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |year=1980 |pages=254–283 |isbn=0-12-431801-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that the best convoys are composed of a combination of intimates and consequential strangers—people in the community, service providers, acquaintances one encounters in leisure and volunteer activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Katherine L. |last=Fiori |first2=Toni C. |last2=Antonucci |first3=Kai S. |last3=Cortina |title=Social Network Typologies and Mental Health Among Older Adults |journal=The Journals of Gerontology: Series B |volume=61 |year=2006 |issue=1 |pages=25–32 |doi= |url=http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/1/P25.short }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perspective of the convoy enables a different view of one's life: "not as a string of events but as a cavalcade of people."&lt;ref name="BlauFingerman2009" /&gt; Running into an old college roommate or a former employer allows an individual to revisit the past with the perspective of the present. Some close relations are part of the convoy from birth to death (parents, children), or for large portions of the journey (partners, close friends), while others (former roommates, exes) drop by the wayside. However, consequential strangers typically travel only part of the way, often for a specific function.  For example, during a health crisis, medical personnel, members of support groups, and home aides might become part of an individual’s convoy for a time.

The nature of a convoy can impact well being. Epidemiological research, which has focused on both strong and weak ties, suggests that social isolation bodes badly for psychological and physiological health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Cacioppo |first2=William |last2=Patrick |title=Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection |location=New York |publisher=Norton |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-393-06170-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, "social integration"—having a personal network of intimates and consequential strangers—may increase longevity and resistance to disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. F. |last=Berkman |first2=S. L. |last2=Syme |title=Social Networks, Host Resistance, and Mortality: A Nine-Year Follow-up Study of Alameda County Residents |journal=[[American Journal of Epidemiology]] |volume=109 |year=1979 |issue=2 |pages=186–204 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/109/2/186.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sheldon |last=Cohen |first2=Benjamin H. |last2=Gottlieb |first3=Lynn G. |last3=Underwood |chapter=Social Relationships and Health |title=Social Support Measurements and Intervention: A Guide for Health and Social Scientists |editor-last=Cohen |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |pages=3–25 |isbn=0-19-512670-X |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an ongoing series of "viral challenge" studies have been conducted over the last twenty years, in which subjects are quarantined and deliberately infected with a  virus.  Those who had contact in the prior two weeks with six or more types of relationships (based on their responses to a checklist of 12 relationship types, both weak and strong) are four times less likely to come down with a cold than volunteers who had three or fewer types of connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sheldon |last=Cohen |title=Social Ties and Susceptibility to the Common Cold |journal=JAMA |volume=277 |year=1997 |issue=24 |pages=1940–1944 |doi=10.1001/jama.1997.03540480040036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A diverse social convoy is also more likely to deliver tangible and emotional support when needed.  It is like having a personal "grapevine," be it at work or in the community, that allows one to keep current, to find the best service provider, and to gain access to different types of resources by being a "bridge" between different groups.&lt;ref name="Burt1992" /&gt; One sociologist theorizes that knowing people in a wide range of professions, across all socio-economic levels, confers "cultural capital," enabling an individual to talk widely on many subjects. In this way, a diverse convoy is like a "liberal arts program, teaching a little of almost everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bonnie H. |last=Erickson |title=Culture, Class, and Connections |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=102 |year=1996 |issue=1 |pages=217–251 |jstor=2782191 |doi=10.1086/230912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar benefits accrue to groups and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Scott E. |last=Page |title=The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies |location=Princeton and Oxford |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-691-12838-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most innovative companies are those in which executives hire a diverse workforce and are open to input from all levels of employees, not just those at the top. They seek inspiration and encourage collaboration ''outside'' their own boundaries as well, in essence drawing from the widest possible range of consequential strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark |last=Granovetter |title=The Impact of Social Structure on Economic Outcomes |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=19 |year=2005 |issue=1 |pages=33–50 |jstor=4134991 |doi=10.1257/0895330053147958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Avan R. |last=Jassawalla |first2=Hemant C. |last2=Sashittal |title=Cultures That Support Product Innovation Processes |journal=Academy of Management Executive |volume=16 |year=2002 |issue=3 |pages=42–54 |doi=10.5465/AME.2002.8540307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, marketing experts realize that tapping into broad social networks is an effective way to promote ideas and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Walter J. |last=Carl |title=What’s All the Buzz About: Everyday Communication and the Relational Basis of Word-of-Mouth and Buzz Marketing Practices |journal=Management Communication Quarterly |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=601–634 |doi=10.1177/0893318905284763 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of social movements and political campaigns also depends on peripheral connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Florence |last=Passy |chapter=Social Networks Matter, But How? |title=Social Movements and Networks: Relationship Approaches to Collective Action |editor1-first=Mario |editor1-last=Diani |editor2-first=Doug |editor2-last=McAdam |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |pages=21–48 |isbn=0-19-925177-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the youthful volunteers who participated in "Freedom Summer," a massive education and voter registration initiative in 1964, were drawn into the civil rights movement by people in the community, friends of friends, teachers and preachers—in short, their consequential strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Doug |last=McAdam |title=Freedom Summer |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-19-504367-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, Barack Obama's successful bid for the Presidency in 2008 exemplified a similar phenomenon, aided and accelerated by technology.

In [[social dynamics]], '''critical mass''' is a sufficient number of adopters of an innovation in a social system so that the rate of adoption becomes self-sustaining and creates further growth. The term is borrowed from nuclear physics and in that field it refers to the amount of a substance needed to sustain a chain reaction.

Social factors influencing critical mass may involve the size, interrelatedness and level of communication in a society or one of its subcultures. Another is [[social stigma]], or the possibility of public advocacy due to such a factor.

Critical mass may be closer to majority consensus in political circles, where the most effective position is more often that held by the majority of people in society. In this sense, small changes in public consensus can bring about swift changes in political consensus, due to the majority-dependent effectiveness of certain ideas as tools of political debate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Critical mass is a concept used in a variety of contexts, including [[Critical mass|physics]], [[group dynamics]], [[politics]], [[public opinion]], and [[technology]].

==History==
The concept of critical mass was originally created by game theorist [[Thomas Schelling]] and sociologist [[Mark Granovetter]] to explain the actions and behaviors of a wide range of people and phenomenon. The concept was first established (although not explicitly named) in Schelling's essay about racial segregation in neighborhoods, published in 1971 in the Journal of Mathematical Sociology,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Schelling, "Dynamic models of segregation", Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and later refined in his book, ''Micromotives and Macrobehavior'', published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, Thomas C. Micromotives and Macrobehavior. New York: Norton, 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He did use the term "critical density" with regard to pollution in his "On the Ecology of Micromotives".&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, Thomas C. "On the Ecology of Micromotives," The Public Interest, No. 25, Fall 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Granovetter, in his essay "Threshold models of collective behavior", published in the [[American Journal of Sociology]] in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = Mark | year = 1978 | title = Threshold Models of Collective Behavior | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 83 | issue = 6| page = 1420 | doi=10.1086/226707}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked to solidify the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Krauth, Brian. "Notes for a History of the Critical Mass Model." SFU.ca. Web. 29 November 2011. https://www.sfu.ca/~bkrauth/papers/critmass.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Everett Rogers later cites them both in his important work ''Diffusion of Innovations'', in which critical mass plays an important role.

===Predecessors===
The concept of critical mass had existed before it entered a sociology context. It was an established concept in [[medicine]], specifically [[epidemiology]], since the 1920s, as it helped to explain the spread of illnesses.

It had also been a present, if not solidified, idea in the study of consumer habits and economics, especially in [[General Equilibrium Theory]]. In his papers, Schelling quotes the well-known [[The Market for Lemons|"The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism"]] paper written in 1970 by George Akerlof.&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, George A. The Market for "lemons": Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism. 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Granovetter cited the [[Nash Equilibrium]] game in his papers.

Finally, [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s essay, "Bandwagon and underdog effects and the possibility of election predictions", published in 1954   in [[Public Opinion Quarterly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuran | first1 = Timur | year = 1987 | title = Chameleon Voters and Public Choice | url = | journal = Public Choice | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 53–78 | doi=10.1007/bf00115654}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been cited as a predecessor to the concept we now know as critical mass.

==Logic of collective action and common good==
Critical mass and the theories behind it help us to understand aspects of humans as they act and interact in a larger social setting. Certain theories, such as [[Mancur Olson]]'s [[Logic of Collective Action]]&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Mancur. The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1971. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Garrett Hardin]]'s [[Tragedy of the Commons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1968 | title = The Tragedy of the Commons | url = | journal = Science | volume = 162 | issue = 3859| pages = 1243–248 | doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 | pmid=5699198 | last1 = Hardin | first1 = G| bibcode = 1968Sci...162.1243H}}&lt;/ref&gt; work to help us understand why humans do or adopt certain things which are beneficial to them, or, more importantly, why they do not. Much of this reasoning has to do with individual interests trumping that which is best for the collective whole, which may not be obvious at the time.

Oliver, Marwell, and Teixeira tackle this subject in relation to critical theory in a 1985 article published in the [[American Journal of Sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oliver | first1 = P. | last2 = Marwell | first2 = G. | last3 = Teixeira | first3 = R. | year = 1985 | title = A Theory of Critical Mass: I. Interdependence, Group Heterogeneity, and the Production of Collective Action | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 552–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their essay, they define that action in service of a public good as "[[collective action]]". "Collective Action" is beneficial to all, regardless of individual contribution. By their definition, then, "critical mass" is the small segment of a societal system that does the work or action required to achieve the common good. The "Production Function" is the correlation between resources, or what individuals give in an effort to achieve public good, and the achievement of that good. Such function can be decelerating, where there is less utility per unit of resource, and in such a case, resource can taper off. On the other hand, the function can be accelerating, where the more resources that are used the bigger the payback. "Heterogeneity" is also important to the achievement of a common good. Variations (heterogeneity) in the value individuals put on a common good or the effort and resources people give is beneficial, because if certain people stand to gain more, they are willing to give or pay more.

==Gender politics==

Critical mass theory in gender politics and collective political action is defined as the critical number of personnel needed to affect policy and make a change not as the token but as an influential body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kanter | first = Rosabeth Moss | author-link = Rosabeth Moss Kanter | title = Some effects of proportions on group life: skewed sex ratios and responses to token women | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 82 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–990  for the [[University of Chicago Press]] | date = March 1977 | jstor = 2777808 | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1086/226425}} [http://www.nhh.no/Files/Filer/adm/personal/Likestilling/MossKanter.pdf Pdf from Norges Handelshøyskole (NHH), the Norwegian School of Economics.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128184313/http://www.nhh.no/files/filer/adm/personal/likestilling/mosskanter.pdf |date=28 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number has been placed at 30%, before women are able to make a substantial difference in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dahlerup | first = Drude | author-link = Drude Dahlerup | title = From a small to a large minority: women in Scandinavian politics | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 275–297 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00372.x | date = December 1988 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00372.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dahlerup | first = Drude | author-link = Drude Dahlerup | title = The story of the theory of critical mass | journal = [[Politics &amp; Gender]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 511–522 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X0624114X | date = December 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X0624114X | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research suggests lower numbers of women working together in legislature can also affect political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Childs | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Krook | first2 = Mona Lena | title = Should feminists give up on critical mass?

==Interactive media==
While critical mass can be applied to many different aspects of sociodynamics, it becomes increasingly applicable to innovations in interactive media such as the telephone, fax, or email. With other non-interactive innovations, the dependence on other users was generally sequential, meaning that the early adopters influenced the later adopters to use the innovation. However, with interactive media, the interdependence was reciprocal, meaning both users influenced each other. This is due to the fact that interactive media have high [[network effect]],&lt;ref name="Rogers, Everett M 2003"&gt;Rogers, Everett M. Diffusion of Innovations. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where in the value and utility of a good or service increases the more users it has. Thus, the increase of adopters and quickness to reach critical mass can therefore be faster and more intense with interactive media, as can the rate at which previous users discontinue their use. The more people that use it, the more beneficial it will be, thus creating a type of snowball effect, and conversely, if users begin to stop using the innovation, the innovation loses utility, thus pushing more users to discontinue their use.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title= Toward a 'Critical Mass' Theory of Interactive Media: Universal Access, Interdependence and Diffusion, 14:491 |author=M. Lynne Markus|year=1987 |publisher=Communication Research |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markus essay===
In [[M. Lynne Markus]]' essay in ''Communication Research'' entitled "Toward a 'Critical Mass' Theory of Interactive Media",&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; several propositions are made that try to predict under what circumstances interactive media is most likely to achieve critical mass and reach [[universal access]], a "common good" using Oliver, ''et al''.'s terminology. One proposition states that such media's existence is all or nothing, where in if universal access is not achieved, then, eventually, use will discontinue. Another proposition suggests that a media's ease of use and inexpensiveness, as well as its utilization of an "active notification capability" will help it achieve universal access. The third proposition states that the heterogeneity, as discussed by Oliver, et al. is beneficial, especially if users are dispersed over a larger area, thus necessitating interactivity via media. Fourth, it is very helpful to have highly sought-after individuals to act as early adopters, as their use acts as incentive for later users. Finally, Markus posits that interventions, both monetarily and otherwise, by governments, businesses, or groups of individuals will help a media reach its critical mass and achieve universal access.

===Fax machine example===
[[File:Samfax.jpg|thumb|300px|A fax machine]]
An example put forth by Rogers in ''Diffusion of Innovations'' was that of the [[fax|fax machine]], which had been around for almost 150 years before it became popular and widely used. It had existed in various forms and for various uses, but with more advancements in the technology of faxes, including the use of existing phone lines to transmit information, coupled with falling prices in both machines and cost per fax, the fax machine reached a critical mass in 1987, when "Americans began to assume that 'everybody else' had a fax machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Adoption and Use of Fax in Sweden |author=Holmlov, Kramer and Karl-Eric Warneryd|year=1990 |publisher=Elmservier Science |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">'''Democratic rationalization''' is term used by [[Andrew Feenberg]] in his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with technology."  Feenberg argues against the idea of ''[[technological determinism]]'' citing flaws in its two fundamental theses.

The first is the ''thesis of unilinear progress''.  This is the belief that technological progress follows a direct and predictable path from lower to higher levels of complexity and that each stage along this path is necessary for progress to occur ([[Feenberg]] 211).

The second is the ''thesis of determination by the base''.  This is the concept that  in a society where a technology had been introduced, that society must organize itself or adapt to the technology ([[Feenberg]] 211).

In his argument against the former thesis [[Feenberg]] says that [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] studies of technology will lead us to realize that there is not a set path by which development of technologies occur but rather an emerging of similar technologies at the same time leading to a multiplicity of choices.  These choices are made based upon certain social factors and upon examining them we will see that they are not deterministic in nature ([[Feenberg]] 212).

Arguing against the latter thesis, [[Feenberg]] calls to our attention social reforms that have been mandated by governments mainly in regards to the protection of its citizens and laborers.  Most of the time these mandates are widely accepted after being passed through the governing body. At which point technology and industry will reform and re-evolve to meet the new standards in a way that has greater efficiency than it did so previously ([[Feenberg]] 214)

==History==
The concept of Digital Business Ecosystem was put forward in 2002 by a group of European researchers and practitioners, including Francesco Nachira, Paolo Dini and Andrea Nicolai, who applied the general notion of digital ecosystems to model the process of adoption and development of ICT-based products and services in competitive, highly fragmented markets like the European one&lt;ref&gt;F Nachira, P Dini, A Nicolai.

==Perspectives==
The digital ecosystem metaphor and models have been applied to a number of business areas related to the production and distribution of knowledge-intensive products and services, including higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Damiani E., Uden, L, &amp; Trisnawaty W. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4233689/ The future of E-learning: E-learning ecosystem.] Inaugural IEEE Digital Ecosystems and Technologies Conference (IEEE DEST), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective of this research is providing methods and tools to achieve a set of objectives of the ecosystem (e.g. sustainability, fairness, bounded information asymmetry, risk control and gracious failure). These objectives are seen as desirable properties whose emergence should be fostered by the digital ecosystem self-organization, rather than as explicit design goals like in conventional IT.

'''Digital literacy''' is a component of media literacy. It refers to an individual's ability to find, evaluate, produce and communicate clear information through writing and other forms of communication on various digital platforms. Digital literacy showcases an individual's grammar, computer, writing, and typing skills on platforms, such as social media and blog sites. Digital Literacy also includes other devices, such as, smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://connect.ala.org/node/181197|title=Digital Literacy Definition {{!}} ALA Connect|website=connect.ala.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While digital literacy initially focused on digital skills and stand-alone computers, its focus has shifted to network devices including the Internet and use of social media. Digital literacy does not replace traditional forms of literacy, instead building upon the skills that form the foundation of traditional forms of literacy.&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/free_download/9780262513623_Confronting_the_Challenges.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203213008/http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/free_download/9780262513623_Confronting_the_Challenges.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-03|title=Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2009|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Society for Technology in Education maintains parameters for digital literacy around six benchmarks. These consist of “''innovation, communication and cooperation, research and information, critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making, digital citizenship, and technology concepts and operations''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iste.org/standards|title=ISTE Standards|website=www.iste.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and pedagogical concepts==
From a competency perspective, digital literacy is framed with literacy, fluency, and mastery of skills needed to use the internet. From an academic perspective, digital literacy is a part of the computing subject area alongside [[computer science]] and [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Furber, S. (2012). [https://royalsociety.org/~/media/education/computing-in-schools/2012-01-12-computing-in-schools.pdf ''Shut down or restart?: The way forward for computing in UK schools''.]
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Digital literacy is a [[New literacies|new literacy]] and can be decomposed into several sub-literacies. One such decomposition considers digital literacy as embracing [[computer literacy]], [[network literacy]], [[information literacy]] and [[social media]] literacy. Previous conceptualizations of digital literacy focused on the practical skills associated with using computers (now considered [[computer literacy]]). These include hardware skills, such as connecting devices, and software skills, such as using application packages. Contemporary conceptualizations of digital literacy add to these traditional skills, and embrace knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviors, particularly with respect to networked devices (which include smartphones, tablets and personal computers).
Digital literacy differs from computer literacy in a number of significant ways. While it embraces the practical skills that computer literacy incorporates, there is a much greater focus on sociological, political, cultural, economic and behavioral aspects of digital technologies.

As a pedagogical approach in curriculum design, the implementation of digital literacy affords far-reaching advantages. The internet is both a source of information and communication that has increased exponentially internationally. Subsequently, integrating technology into the classroom in a meaningful way, exposes students to a range of literacy practices called multi-literacies which broadens their outlook and widens vistas of information and knowledge which is highly constructive. This methodology embraces the constructivist theory of learning (Bruner, 1978) wherein learners draw from their existing knowledge in order to construct new learning.

Given the many varied implications that digital literacy has on students and educators, pedagogy has responded by emphasizing four specific models of engaging with digital mediums. Those four models are text participating, code breaking, text analyzing, and text using. These methods present students (and other learners) with the ability to fully engage with the media, but also enhance the way the individual is able to relate the digital text to their lived experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinrichsen|first=Juliet|last2=Coombs|first2=Antony|date=2014-01-31|title=The five resources of critical digital literacy: a framework for curriculum integration|url=https://journal.alt.ac.uk/index.php/rlt/article/view/1433|journal=Research in Learning Technology|language=en|volume=21|issue=0|doi=10.3402/rlt.v21.21334|issn=2156-7077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital and media literacy==
Media literacy education began in the United Kingdom and the United States as a result of war propaganda in the 1930s and the rise of advertising in the 1960s, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens|last=Boyd|first=Danah|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-300-16631-6|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=177–194|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulative messaging and the increase in various forms of media further concerned educators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Educators began to promote media literacy education in order to teach individuals how to judge and access the media messages they were receiving.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ability to critique digital and media content allows individuals to identify biases and evaluate messages independently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Danah boyd|Danah Boyd]] stresses the importance of critical media literacy, especially for teens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She advocates that critical media literacy skills are the first step in identifying biases in media content, such as online or print advertising.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Technical skills and knowledge of navigating computer systems further helps individuals in evaluating information on their own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Barriers in acquiring technical skills and computer knowledge set forth a limit for individuals in fully participating in the digital world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In order for individuals to evaluate digital and media messages independently, they must demonstrate digital and media literacy competence. Renee Hobbs, professor of Communication and Media at the University of Rhode Island, developed a list of skills that demonstrate digital and media literacy competence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Renee|last2=Martens|first2=Hans|year=2015|title=How media literacy supports civic engagement in a digital age|url=|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=23|issue=2|pages=120–137|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.961636|via=Fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital and media literacy involves knowing how to retrieve, distribute, and understand information found in digital environments such as the internet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Digital and media literacy includes the ability to examine and comprehend the meaning of messages, judging credibility, and assessing the quality of the digital work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The individual is capable of analyzing digital and media messages by recognizing the author's perspective and overall purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A digital and media literate individual has the aptitude to create diverse forms of digital content and possesses technology skills to create digital content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The individual becomes a socially responsible member of their community by spreading awareness and helping others find digital solutions at home, work, or on a national platform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 21st-century skills ===
{{main article|21st century skills}}
Digital literacy requires certain skill sets that are interdisciplinary in nature. Warschauer and Matuchniak (2010) list three skill sets, or [[21st century skills]],&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, Mark; Matuchniak, Tina (2010). "New Technology and Digital Worlds: Analyzing Evidence of Equity in Access, Use, and Outcomes". ''Review of Research in Education''. '''34''': 179–225. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.3102/0091732X09349791|10.3102/0091732X09349791]].&lt;/ref&gt;  that individuals need to master in order to be digitally literate: information, media, and technology; learning and innovation skills; and life and career skills. In order to achieve information, media, and technology skills, one needs to achieve competency in information literacy, media literacy and [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] (information communicative technologies). Encompassed within Learning and Innovation Skills, one must also be able to exercise their creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and collaboration skills (the "[[Four Cs of 21st century learning]]"). In order to be competent in Life and Career Skills, it is also necessary to be able to exercise flexibility and adaptability, initiative and self-direction, social and cross-cultural skills, productivity and accountability, leadership and responsibility.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Aviram, A., &amp; Eshet-Alkalai, Y. (2006). Towards a theory of digital literacy: Three scenarios for the next steps. European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning. Retrieved from http://www.eurodl.org/index.php?p=archives&amp;year=2006&amp;halfyear=1&amp;abstract=223
&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviram &amp; Eshet-Alkalai contend that there are five types of literacies that are encompassed in the umbrella term that is digital literacy.
# Photo-visual literacy is the ability to read and deduce information from visuals.
# Reproduction literacy is the ability to use digital technology to create a new piece of work or combine existing pieces of work together to make it your own.
# Branching literacy is the ability to successfully navigate in the non-linear medium of digital space.
# Information literacy is the ability to search, locate, assess and critically evaluate information found on the web and on-shelf in libraries. 
# Socio-emotional literacy refers to the social and emotional aspects of being present online, whether it may be through socializing, and collaborating, or simply consuming content.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications of digital literacy ==

=== In education ===
Schools are continuously updating their curricula to keep up with accelerating technological developments. This often includes [[computers in the classroom]], the use of educational software to teach curricula, and course materials being made available to students online. Students are often taught literacy skills such as how to verify [[source criticism|credible sources]] online, [[citation|cite]] web sites, and prevent plagiarism in a technological world. Google and Wikipedia are frequently used by students "for everyday life research,"&lt;ref&gt;Head, A., &amp; Eisenberg, M. (2009, December). ''[http://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/how_students_seek_information_in_the_digital_age.pdf How college students seek information in the digital age]''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/how_students_seek_information_in_the_digital_age.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; and are just two common tools that facilitate modern education.  Digital technology has impacted the way material is taught in the classroom. With the use of technology rising over the past decade, educators are enhancing traditional forms of learning with digital literacy through different platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HyIsDAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=education+and+social+media+toward+a+digital+future+pdf+jstor&amp;ots=-qZgodm78j&amp;sig=RO_xIij2Nfsh_4HmY87FP1ADcPM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Education and Social Media: Toward a Digital Future|last1=Greenhow|first1=Christine|last2=Sonnevend|first2=Julia|date=6 May 2016|publisher=MIT Press|language=en|last3=Agur|first3=Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several websites are assisting in these efforts such as [[Google Docs]], [[Prezi]], and, [[Easybib]]. Each service has assisted students by teaching collaboration, allowing students to use pre-made, creative presentation templates, and helping generate citations in any given format. Additionally, educators have also turned to social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Edmodo]], [[Schoology]] and even [[Instagram]] to communicate and share ideas with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.com/2013/03/facebook-edmodo-schoology-oh-my.html|title=Lisa Nielsen: The Innovative Educator: Facebook, Edmodo, &amp; Schoology.

====Digital writing====
University of Southern Mississippi professor, Dr. Suzanne Mckee-Waddell&lt;ref&gt;Mckee-Waddell, S. s. (2015). Digital Literacy: Bridging the Gap with Digital Writing Tools. ''[[Delta Kappa Gamma]] Bulletin'', ''82''(1), 26-31.
&lt;/ref&gt;  conceptualized the idea of digital composition as the ability to integrate multiple forms of communication technologies and research to create a better understanding of a topic. Digital composition keeps educators and students connected through modern teaching techniques. Digital writing in particular is a new type of digital composition being taught increasingly within universities. Digital writing is a [[pedagogy]] focused on the impact technology has had on various writing environments; it is not simply the process of using a computer to write. Rather than the traditional print perspective, digital writing enables students to explore modern technologies and learn how different writing spaces affect the meaning, [[audience]], and [[readability]] of text. Educators in favor of digital writing argue that it is necessary because "technology fundamentally changes how writing is produced, delivered, and received."&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davidson, Bill; Cushman, Ellen; Grabill, Jeff; DeVoss, Danielle Nicole; Porter, Jim (2005). [http://english.ttu.edu/kairos/10.1/binder2.html?coverweb/wide/index.html "Why teach digital writing?"]. ''Kairos''. '''10''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of teaching digital writing is that students will increase their ability to produce a relevant, high-quality product, instead of just a standard academic paper.&lt;ref&gt;Beers, Kylene; Probst, Robert; Rief, Linda (2007). ''Adolescent Literacy: Turning Promise into Practice.'' UK: Heinemann Publishing. {{ISBN|9780325011288}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of digital writing is the use of [[hypertext]]. As opposed to printed text, hypertext invites readers to explore information in a non-linear fashion. Hypertext consists of traditional text and [[hyperlinks]] that send readers to other texts. These links may refer to related terms or concepts (such is the case on [[Wikipedia]]), or they may enable readers to choose the order in which they read. The process of digital writing requires the composer to make unique "decisions regarding linking and omission." These decisions "give rise to questions about the author's responsibilities to the [text] and to objectivity."&lt;ref&gt;McAdams, Mindy; Berger, Stephanie. ''[http://www.journalofelectronicpublishing.org/hypertext/index.html "Hypertext"]''. Journal of Electronic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In society===
Digital literacy is present within society by allowing people to communicate through the use of various digital platforms. Literacy in [[social network service]]s and [[Web 2.0]] sites helps people stay in contact with others, pass timely information, and even buy and sell [[goods and services]]. Digital literacy can also prevent people from being taken advantage of online, as [[photo manipulation]], [[E-mail fraud]]s and [[phishing]] often can fool the digitally illiterate, costing victims money and making them vulnerable to [[identity theft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/16/the-growing-need-for-technical-and-digital-literacy|title=US News|last=Longardner|first=Tara|date=2015|work=The Growing Need for Technical and Digital Literacy|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those using technology and the internet to commit these manipulations and fraudulent acts possess the digital literacy abilities to fool victims by understanding the technical trends and consistencies; it becomes important to be digitally literate to always think one step ahead when utilizing the digital world. 

With the emergence of [[social media]], individuals who are digitally literate now have a major voice online.&lt;ref&gt;nashoa (January 6, 2014). ''[https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-socialcollab/ "Social networks using web 2.0"]''. IBM.&lt;/ref&gt; Websites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as well as personal websites and [[blogs]], have enabled a new type of journalism that is subjective, personal, and "represents a global conversation that is connected through its community of readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cameron/cv/pubs/04-01.pdf|title=Audience, Structure, and Authority in the Weblog Community|last=Marlow|first=Cameron|publisher=MIT Media Laboratory|accessdate=2 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These online communities foster group interactivity among the digitally literate. Social media also help users establish a [[digital identity]] or a "symbolic digital representation of identity attributes."&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Mark (2005). [https://blogs.oracle.com/identity/entry/identity_map_core_identity "Identity Map"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126133624/https://blogs.oracle.com/identity/entry/identity_map_core_identity |date=2016-11-26 }}. Oracle.&lt;/ref&gt;  Without digital literacy or the assistance of someone who is digitally literate, one cannot possess a personal digital identity (this is closely allied to web literacy).

Research has demonstrated that the differences in the level of digital literacy depend mainly on age and education level, while the influence of gender is decreasing (Hargittai, 2002; van Dijk, 2005; van Dijk and van Deursen, 2009). Among young people, digital literacy is high in its operational dimension. Young people rapidly move through hypertext and have a familiarity with different kinds of online resources. However, the skills to critically evaluate content found online show a deficit (Gui and Argentin, 2011).

=== In the workforce ===
The [[Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (H.R. 803; 113th Congress)|2014 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)]] defines digital literacy skills as a workforce preparation activity.&lt;ref&gt;IMLS press release: [http://www.imls.gov/2.2_billion_reasons_to_pay_attention_to_wioa.aspx $2.2 Billion Reasons to Pay Attention to WIOA]. 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are digitally literate are more likely to be economically secure,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Wynne, M., &amp; Cooper, L. (2007). ''[http://www.digitalaccess.org/pdf/White_Paper.pdf Digital Inclusion Imperatives Offer Municipalities New Social and Economic Opportunities]''. Retrieved from POWER UP: The Campaign for Digital Inclusion.&lt;/ref&gt; as many jobs require a working knowledge of computers and the Internet to perform basic tasks. 

[[White-collar worker|White collar]] jobs are today performed primarily on computers and portable devices. Many of these jobs require proof of digital literacy to be hired or promoted. Sometimes companies will administer their own tests to employees, or official certification will be required.

As technology has become cheaper and more readily available, more [[blue-collar]] jobs have required digital literacy as well. Manufacturers and retailers, for example, are expected to collect and analyze data about productivity and market trends to stay competitive. Construction workers often use computers to increase employee safety.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Job recruiters often use [[employment website|employment Web sites]] to find potential employees, thus magnifying the importance of digital literacy in securing a job. [[LinkedIn]] is one of the most popular employment sites, in which professionals can connect with others in their field, search for potential employment opportunities, or put out feelers for jobs they may need filled. 

Possessing advanced and capable digital literacy serves as an essential skill allowing individuals to compete in the workforce. Socially, it has become almost necessary to possess a degree of digital literacy on all job levels, as society has become a technology based one and will continue to be such.

== Digital divide ==
{{main article|Digital divide}}
Digital literacy and digital access have become increasingly important competitive differentiators for individuals using the internet meaningfully.&lt;ref&gt;Celik, A. (2007). [http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/gaid/unpan032783.pdf ''Our Common Humanity in the Information Age: Principles and Values for Development''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridging the economic and developmental divides is in large measure a matter of increasing digital literacy and access for peoples who have been left out of the information and communications technology (ICT) revolutions.

Research published in 2012 found that the digital divide, as defined by access to information technology, does not exist amongst youth in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cohen, C. J. 2011"&gt;Cohen, C. J., &amp; Kahne, J. (2011). Participatory Politics: New Media and Youth Political Action. Chicago, IL: MacArthur Network on Youth and Participatory Politics.&lt;/ref&gt; Young people of all races and ethnicities report being connected to the internet at rates of 94-98%.&lt;ref name="Cohen, C. J. 2011"/&gt; There remains, however, a [[Participation (decision making)#Civic opportunity gap|civic opportunity gap]], where youth from poorer families and those attending lower socioeconomic status schools are less likely to encounter opportunities to apply their digital literacies toward civic ends.&lt;ref&gt;Kahne, Joseph and Middaugh, Ellen (2008). As technology has become cheaper and more readily available, more blue-collar jobs have required digital literacy as well. "Democracy for some: The civic opportunity gap in high school", Circle Working Paper, retrieved 2013-09-25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Community Informatics|Community informatics]] overlaps to a considerable degree with digital literacy by being concerned with ensuring the opportunity not only for ICT access at the community level, but also according to [[Michael Gurstein]], that the means for the "effective use" of ICTs for community betterment and empowerment are available.&lt;ref&gt;Gurstein, Michael (2003). [http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027 "Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the digital divide"]. ''First Monday''. '''8''' (12). [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107|10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107]].&lt;/ref&gt; Digital literacy is, of course, one of the significant elements in this process.

The United Nations Global Alliance for ICT and Development ([[GAID]]) seeks to address this set of issues at an international and global level. Many organizations (e.g. [[Per Scholas|''Per'' Scholas]] for underserved communities in the United States and [http://interconnection.org/ InterConnection] for underserved communities around the world as well as the U.S.) focus on addressing this concern at national, local and community levels.

=== Definition ===
The digital divide was first widely discussed by journalists, academics, and governmental agencies in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The digital divide was used to distinguish between the digital accessibility of wealthy and lower-income groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Jessamyn West (librarian)|Jessamyn C. West]] defines the digital divide as the gap between individuals who can and cannot easily access technology, or the haves and have-nots.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohron|first=Madalyn|year=2016|title=The Continuing Digital Divide in the United States|url=|journal=The Serials Librarian|volume=69|issue=1|pages=77–78|doi=10.1080/0361526X.2015.1036195|via=Fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/741453556|title=Without a Net : Librarians Bridging the Digital Divide.|date=2011|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|others=West, Jessamyn C.|isbn=1283134527|oclc=741453556}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide highlights the privileges individuals have in accessing technology.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Expanding on the definition of the digital divide, [[Howard Besser]] argues that the digital divide means more than technology access between the haves and have-nots. The digital divide encompasses aspects such as information literacy, appropriateness of content, and access to content.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Besser, Howard (2001). ''[https://tcla.gseis.ucla.edu/divide/politics/besser.html "The Next Digital Divides"]''. Teaching to Change LA. 1 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond access, a digital divide exists between those who have the ability to apply critical thinking to technology.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Language and English fluency creates a barrier in the digital divide as well, as most content online is written in English.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The digital divide includes a gap between individuals who have the ability to create digital content or are merely consumers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Socioeconomic factors ===
In 1994 the United States Department of Commerce began investigating the causes of the digital divide. The [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration|National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)]] conducted the survey, Falling Through the Net.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The NTIA discovered that many socioeconomic factors, such as income, geographical location, age, and education were the driving forces of the digital divide.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Older, less educated, and lower-income individuals were less likely to own a telephone or computer in their homes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The NTIA conducted a second survey in 1999 and found that statistics of the digital divide improved.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Computer ownership and internet access increased across every demographic group and geographic area. However, the research found that certain groups were advancing faster in regards to internet access.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Those who had easy access to technology were growing more information rich than the have-not group.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The research revealed that the socioeconomic factors found in the first survey are still present in growing the digital divide, although access to computers and internet use increased.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Digital natives and digital immigrants ===
[[Marc Prensky]] invented and popularized the terms digital natives and digital immigrants. A digital native, according to Marc Prensky, is an individual born into the digital age.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Prensky, Marc (2001). "Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants". ''On the Horizon''. '''9''' (5): 1–6. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.1108/10748120110424816|10.1108/10748120110424816]].&lt;/ref&gt; A digital immigrant refers to an individual who adopts technology later in life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These terms aid in understanding the issues of teaching digital literacy, however, simply being a digital native does not make one digitally literate.

Digital immigrants, although they adapt to the same technology as natives, possess a sort of accent which restricts them from communicating the way natives do. In fact, research shows that, due to the brain's malleable nature, technology has changed the way today's students read, perceive, and process information.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Nicholas (2008). "Is Google Making Us Stupid?". The Atlantic. 107 (2). doi:10.1111/j.1744-7984.2008.00172.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that today's educators may struggle to find effective teaching methods for digital natives. Digital immigrants might resist teaching digital literacy because they themselves were not taught that way. Marc Prensky believes this is a problem because today's students speak a new language that educators do not understand.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Statistics and popular representations of the elderly portray them as digital immigrants. For example, Canada in 2010 found that 29% of its citizens 75 years of age and older, and 60% of its citizens between the ages of 65-74 had browsed the internet in the past month.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Conversely, internet activity reached almost 100% among its 15 through 24-year-old citizens.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Allen, Mary (2013). [http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11768-eng.htm "Cultural consumption on the Internet by older Canadians"]. Statistics Canada. Perspectives on Canadian Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene Loos identifies the most common assumptions about digital technologies and the elderly, all of which contribute to portray them as digital immigrants and to perpetuate digital ageism.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Senior citizens may be regarded as a homogenous group, however, this group does not want or is not able to make use of digital information sources.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Eugene Loos claims this is not a problem because as time passes, these generations will be succeeded by new generations that have no problem at all with digital technologies.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Loos, Eugene (2012). [http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/131944 "Senior citizens: Digital immigrants in their own country?"]. ''Observatorio''. '''6''' (1): 1–23. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.7458/obs612012513|10.7458/obs612012513]].&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, recent research has suggested much variation in the digital literacy of older adults, providing a six-fold typology: Non-Users (the smallest category), Reluctants, Apprehensives, Basic Users, Go-Getters, and Savvy Users. There does not seem to be a strong relationship between the amount of use and digital skills, although older adults tend to disparage their literacy compared to younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;Anabel Quan-Haase, Carly Williams, Maria Kicevski, Isioma Elueze, &amp; [[Barry Wellman]]. 2018. “Dividing the Grey Divide: Deconstructing Myths about Older Adults’ Online Activities, Skills, and Attitudes.” ''American Behavioral Scientist'' 62,9 (August): 1207-1228  [https://doi.org/10.1177/0002764218777572]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Marc Prensky is credited as the originator of digital natives and digital immigrants because he popularized the concepts, Poet and cyberlibertarian [[John Perry Barlow]] and media theorist [[Douglas Rushkoff]] have also been cited to have coined the terms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; John Perry Barlow used the concepts in his statement entitled ''A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'', for the 1996 World Economic Forum in Davos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; John Perry Barlow's poetry showcases the generational gap that grew with the rise of technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; John Perry Barlow metaphorically suggested that children are natives in the growing digital world and parents are fearful of the growing generational gap in regard to technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Douglas Rushkoff employed the concepts of digital natives and digital immigrants in his book, ''Playing the Future''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Douglas Rushkoff praises children's progress and growing competence with technology and labels youth as digital natives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Ahn, Juyeon, &amp; Jung, Yoonhyuka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0-eds.a.ebscohost.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=b53ae3ba-2bcb-424b-833f-10f2aa4f0077@sessionmgr4006&amp;hid=4108&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=117311175&amp;db=edb|title=Library Log in|website=0-eds.a.ebscohost.com.ignacio.usfca.edu|access-date=2016-11-29}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a digital native is someone who has grown up with technologies. For example, a pager, the first cell-phone, and an oversized cube computer. They also have different understandings of digital use. While digital immigrants, who have been exposed to digital technology later in life. Prensky states, "digital natives” indicates the young generation born after the 1980s, “digital immigrants” designates the parent generation of DN. Because DN have been growing with diverse digital technologies, they are inclined to adopt and be favorable to emerging technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahn|first=J|last2=Jung|first2=Y|year=2016|title=The common sense of dependence on smartphone: A comparison between digital natives and digital immigrants.|url=|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1236–1256|doi=10.1177/1461444814554902|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital visitors and digital residents ===
In contrast to Marc Prensky, David S. White has been publicizing his concept of [[Digital Visitor and Resident|digital visitors and residents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=White |first=David |last2=Le Cornu |first2=Alison |title=Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement |url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3171/3049 |publisher=First Monday |publication-date=2011-09-05 |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=775–786 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x |issn=1396-0466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, D. (2013, May 31). ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sFBadv04eY Visitors and residents]'' Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sFBadv04eY
&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, the concept is that visitors leave no online social trace whereas residents live a portion of their lives online. These are not two separate categories of people, but rather a description of a continuum of behaviors. It is probable that many individuals demonstrate both visitor and residential behaviors in different contexts. Dave White has developed a mapping tool which explores this concept.&lt;ref&gt;White, D. (2013, June 5). ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9IMObcyKbo Visitors and residents mapping activity].'' Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9IMObcyKbo.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Participation gap ===
Media theorist [[Henry Jenkins]] coined the term participation gap and distinguished the participation gap from the digital divide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Henry Jenkins, the participation gap describes the gap in skills that emerge when individuals have different levels of access to technology.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/15468.htm|title=The Participation Gap: A Conversation with media expert and MIT Professor Henry Jenkins|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2008|website=National Education Association|publisher=|access-date=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Jenkins states that students learn different sets of technology skills if they only have access to the internet in a library or school.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Students who have access to the internet at home have more opportunities to develop their skills and have fewer limitations, such as computer time limits and website filters commonly used in libraries.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; 

The effects of the participation gap were studied by Danah Boyd, who observed and conducted fieldwork on teens in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Danah Boyd observed privileged and disadvantaged teens' different experiences with technology. In New York, she observed a teen girl use her Android phone for texting and using mobile applications. The teen girl was able to use technology to participate in social media, but the internet was too slow on her phone to complete homework assignments. Although the teen girl had full access to the internet, the slow internet and mobile device itself limited her experience in further improving her competence with technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The teen girl's limited access to technology highlights the participatory gap in skills that individuals experience when they have limited access to the internet and various modes of technology.

==Global impact==
{{Globalize |date=November 2016}}
Government officials around the world have emphasized the importance of digital literacy for their [[economy]]. According to HotChalk, an Online resource for educators: "Nations with centralized education systems, such as China, are leading the charge and implementing digital literacy training programs faster than anyone else. For those countries, the news is good."

Many [[developing nations]] are also focusing on digital literacy education to compete globally.

Economically, socially and regionally marginalised people have benefited from the ECDL Foundation’s ECDL / ICDL programme through funding and support from [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] initiatives, international development agency funding and [[NGO|non-governmental organisations]].

The [[Philippines]]' [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Education Secretary]] [[Jesli Lapus]] has emphasized the importance of digital literacy in Filipino education. He claims a resistance to change is the main obstacle to improving the nation's education in the [[globalized]] world. In 2008, Lapus was inducted into Certiport's "Champions of Digital Literacy" Hall of Fame for his work to emphasize digital literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Philippine Information Agency. (2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20090626063509/http://www.pia.gov.ph/default.asp?m=12&amp;fi=p080826.htm&amp;no=19 ''DepEd: Use ICT to improve learning outcomes''&lt;nowiki&gt; [Press Release]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in 2011 by the Southern African Linguistics &amp; Applied Language Studies program observed some South African university students regarding their digital literacy.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Kajee, L; Balfour, R (2011). "Students' access to digital literacy at a South African university: Privilege and marginalisation". ''Southern African Linguistics &amp; Applied Language Studies''. '''29''': 187. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.2989/16073614.2011.633365|10.2989/16073614.2011.633365]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that while their courses did require some sort of digital literacy, very few students actually had access to a computer. Many had to pay others to type any work, as they their digital literacy was almost nonexistent. Findings show that class, ignorance, and inexperience still affect any access to learning South African university students may need.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In 2011, the EU Kids Online conducted a study that examined the amount of time children in Europe spent on the computer.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Matyjas, B (2015). "Mass Media and Children. Globality in Everyday Life". Procedia - Social And Behavioral Sciences. 174: 2898–2904. doi:[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281501085X 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.1026.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that roughly 85% of European children use a computer without the supervision of a teacher or parent, showing that these children have acquired some form of digital literacy.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="991">A '''dromedary bag''' is a  collapsible plastic bladder for holding [[Backpacking (wilderness)#Water|water for drinking]].  Backpackers carry dromedary bags in areas where water is not readily available or is not clean enough to drink.  Dromedary bags are useful when traveling through the desert, but are generally too heavy for extended trips. The opening sequences of the film ''[[Wild (2014 film)|Wild]]'' demonstrate the heaviness of a backpack laden with water.

Not to be confused with the [[hydration pack]], dromedary bags are able to carry larger amounts of water.  They are much more effective at distributing water amongst a group rather than personal use only. The dromedary bag was invented by Sir [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] whilst exploring South east [[Queensland]]  and seeing [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] carrying [[water]] in [[kangaroo]] skins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="623">A '''dropout''' is a momentary loss of [[signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] in a [[communications system]], usually caused by [[noise]], [[radio propagation|propagation]] anomalies, or system malfunctions.  For [[analog signal]]s, a dropout is frequently gradual and partial, depending on the [[cause]].  For [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|digital signal]]s, dropouts are more pronounced, usually being sudden and complete, due to the [[cliff effect]].  In [[mobile telephony]], a dropout of more than a few [[second]]s will result in a [[dropped call]].

Some studies&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; have found that "women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners".

Domestic violence during pregnancy can be missed by medical professionals because it often presents in non-specific ways. A number of countries have been statistically analyzed to calculate the prevalence of this phenomenon:

There are a number of presentations that can be related to domestic violence during pregnancy: delay in seeking care for injuries; late booking, non-attenders at appointments, self-discharge; frequent attendance, vague problems; aggressive or over-solicitous partner; [[Burn (injury)|burns]], pain, tenderness, injuries; vaginal tears, bleeding, [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s; and [[miscarriage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Domestic violence against a pregnant woman can also affect the fetus and can have lingering effects on the child after birth.  Physical abuse is associated with [[neonatal death]] (1.5% versus 0.2%), and verbal abuse is associated with [[low birth weight]] (7.6% versus 5.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yost, Nicole P. |author2=Bloom, Steven L. |author3=McIntire, Donald D. |author4=Leveno, Kenneth J. |title=A Prospective Observational Study of Domestic Violence During Pregnancy |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=61–65 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15994618 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000164468.06070.2a |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Against men ===
Women's violence towards men is a serious social problem.&lt;ref&gt;In D.R. Loseke, R.J. Gelles &amp; M.M. Cavanaugh (Eds.), Current controversies on family violence (2nd edition, pp. 55–77). Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; While much attention has been focused on domestic violence against women, researchers argue that [[domestic violence against men]] is a substantial social problem worthy of attention.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, the issue of victimization of men by women has been contentious, due in part to studies which report drastically different statistics regarding domestic violence.

Some studies—typically crime studies—show that men are substantially more likely than women to use violence.&lt;ref name="Extent"&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles1/nij/181867.txt Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies—typically family and domestic violence studies—show that men are more likely to inflict injuries, but also that when all acts of physical aggression or violence are considered in [[Aggregate data|aggregate]], women are equally violent as men,&lt;ref&gt;"A review of the research literature indicates that female intimate partner violence (IPV) is a frequent as male IPV. It is just as severe and has much the same consequences for males as for females." Donald G. Dutton."Female intimate partner violence and developmental trajectories of abusive females." ''[[International Journal of Men's Health]]''. Spring 2007. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAU/is_1_6/ai_n27283525/?tag=content;col1]&lt;/ref&gt; or more violent than men.&lt;ref&gt;A 2007 study of over 2,400 Spanish high school students found that girls are substantially more likely than boys to exhibit physical aggression (41.9% vs. 31.7%), including higher rates of hitting/kicking (13.4% vs 5.3%), slapping (12.4% vs 3.1%) and shoving/grabbing (22.5% vs 11.9%). See Munoz-Rivas, M. J., Grana, J. L., O'Leary, K. D., &amp; Gonzalez, M. P. (2007). Aggression in adolescent dating relationships: prevalence, justification, and health consequences. Journal of Adolescent Health, 40, 298–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A 2000 meta analysis found that men inflict 65% of domestic injuries, but women are more likely (d=-.05) to use any act of violence or aggression. See Archer, J. (2000)."Sex differences in aggression between heterosexual partners: A meta-analytic review". ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'', 126, 651–680.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Erin Pizzey]], founder of one of the world's first refuges for battered women, distinguished between the "genuinely battered" and the "violence prone, " additionally arguing that roughly two-thirds of the women at her shelter were violence prone, often provoking physical aggression and initiating violent conflicts. See Pizzey's "[http://dvmen.org/dv-130.htm Comparative Study Of Battered Women And Violence-Prone Women, "], co-researched with Dr. John Gayford of Warlingham Hospital.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A study of university students in Spain found that "Violent psychological behaviors (characterized by the presence of verbal aggression and coercive and jealous behaviors) and physical aggression were significantly higher in women, though the consequences of physical aggression were worse for the women's health." See Marina J. Muñoz-Rivas, et al. [http://www.psicothema.com/english/psicothema.asp?ID=3334 Physical and Psychological Aggression in Dating Relationships Amongst Spanish University Students] Psicothema 2007. Vol. 19, no. 1, p. 102-107&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Hamel, John. Russel, Brenda R. "The Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project: Implications for Law Enforcement Responses to Domestic Violence." January 14. DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4614-5871-5_10 Chapter 10.

In May 2007, researchers with the [[Centers for Disease Control]] reported on rates of self-reported violence among intimate partners using data from a 2001 study. In the study, almost one-quarter of participants reported some violence in their relationships. Half of these involved one-sided ("non-reciprocal") attacks and half involved both assaults and counter assaults ("reciprocal violence"). Women reported committing one-sided attacks more than twice as often as men (70% ''versus'' 29%). In all cases of intimate partner violence, women were more likely to be injured than men, but 25% of men in relationships with two-sided violence reported injury compared to 20% of women reporting injury in relationships with one-sided violence. Women were more likely to be injured in non-reciprocal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, D. et al. (2007) Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence. Am J Public Health. 2007 May; 97(5): 941–947. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020, http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray A. Straus|Straus]] argues that these discrepancies between the two data sets are due to several factors. For example, Straus notes that crime studies use different methodologies than family conflict studies.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Murray A. (1999). "The Controversy Over Domestic Violence by Women". In ''Violence in Intimate Relationships''.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Straus notes that most studies show that while men inflict the greater portion of injuries, women are ''at least'' as likely as men to shove, punch, slap or otherwise physically assault their partner, and that such relatively minor assaults often escalate to more serious assaults. Men generally do not report such assaults if asked general questions about violence or abuse; older studies frequently failed to ask about specific actions, thus falling afoul of quite different cultural gender norms for what constitutes abuse. ''Minor'' assaults perpetrated by women are also a major problem, even when they do not result in injury, because they put women in danger of much more severe retaliation by men.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The 2000 CDC report, based on phone interviews with 8000 men and 8000 women, reported that 7.5% of men claim to have been raped or assaulted by an intimate at some time in their life (compared to 25% of women), and 0.9 percent of men claim to have been raped or assaulted in the previous 12 months (compared to 1.5% of women).&lt;ref name="Extent"/&gt;

A 2007–2008 online non-random, self-report survey of the experiences and health of men who sustained partner violence in the past year. The study showed that male victims of IPV are very hesitant to report the violence or seek help. Reasons given for non-reporting were they (1) may be ashamed to come forward; (2) may not be believed; and (3) may be accused of being a batterer when they do come forward. The 229 U.S. heterosexual men, between 18 and 59, had been physically assaulted by their female partner within previous year and did seek help. The researchers say their findings emphasize the need for prevention on all levels:

* Primary prevention: Educate public and providers that both sexes can be IPV victims
* Secondary prevention: First responders (police, hotlines, medical professionals) should take concerns seriously from all individuals (including males) seeking help
* Tertiary prevention: Rehabilitative services available to all individuals&lt;ref&gt;Denise A. Hines, Emily M. Douglas.

Some sources state that gay and lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples,&lt;ref name="Karmen"/&gt; while other sources state domestic violence among gay and lesbian couples might be higher than among heterosexual couples, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that [[Domestic violence in lesbian relationships|lesbian couples experience domestic violence]] less than heterosexual couples do.&lt;ref name="Hampton"/&gt; By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Bonnie S.

Of this sample of women, 78.2% had been in a prior relationship with a man. Reports of violence by men were all lower than reports of violence in prior relationships with women (sexual victimization, 41.9% (vs. 56.8% with women); physical victimization 32.4% (vs. 45%) and emotional victimization 55.1% (vs. 64.5%)."

When it comes to domestic violence towards children involving physical abuse, research in the UK by the [[NSPCC]] indicated that "most violence occurred at home" (78 per cent). 40—60% of men and women who abuse other adults also abuse their children.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychology Association.

=== Between teenagers ===
{{Main|Teen dating violence}}

{{Globalize/US|date=February 2015}}
Teen dating violence is a pattern of [[controlling behavior]] by one teenager over another teenager who are in a dating relationship. While there are many similarities to "traditional" domestic violence there are also some differences. Teens are much more likely than adults to become isolated from their peers as the result of controlling behavior by their boyfriend/girlfriend. Also, for many teens the abusive relationship may be their first dating experience and have never had a "normal" dating experience with which to compare it. While teenagers are trying to establish their sexual identities, they are also confronting violence in their relationships and exposure to technology. Studies document that teenagers are experiencing significant amounts of dating or domestic violence. Depending on the population studied and the way dating violence is defined, between 9 and 35% of teens have experienced domestic violence in a dating relationship. When a broader definition of abuse that encompasses physical, sexual, and emotional abuse is used, one in three teen girls is subjected to dating abuse."&lt;ref name="King-Ries 2011 131–164"&gt;{{cite journal|last=King-Ries|first=Andrew|title=Teens, Technology, and Cyberstalking: The Domestic Violence Wave of the Future?|journal=Texas Journal of Women and the Law|year=2011|volume=20|pages=131–164|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a significant number of teens are victims of stalking by intimate partners. Although involvement with romantic relationships is a critical aspect of adolescence, these relationships also present serious risks for teenagers. Unfortunately, adolescents in dating relationships are at greater risk of intimate partner violence than any other age group. Approximately one third of adolescent girls are victims of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner. Estimates of sexual victimization range from 14% to 43% of girls and 0.3% to 36% for boys. According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2009, nearly 10% of students nationwide had been intentionally hit, slapped, or physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend. Twenty-six percent of girls in a relationship reported being threatened with violence or experiencing verbal abuse; 13% reported being physically hurt or hit.&lt;ref name="King-Ries 2011 131–164"/&gt;

==Measuring==
Measures of the incidence of violence in intimate relationships can differ markedly in their findings depending on the measures used. Care is needed when using domestic violence statistics to ensure that both gender bias and under-reporting issues do not affect the inferences that are drawn from the statistics.

Some researchers, such as Michael P. Johnson, suggest that where and how domestic violence is measured also affects findings, and caution is needed to ensure statistics drawn from one class of situations are not applied to another class of situations in a way that might have fatal consequences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13818 New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060449/http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13818 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers, such as David Murray Fergusson, counter that domestic violence prevention services, and statistics that they produce, target the extreme end of domestic violence and preventing child abuse rather than domestic violence between couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13825 New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060442/http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13825 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender bias===
{{weasel|date=September 2013}}
[[Statistical survey|Survey]] approaches to gathering domestic violence statistics have shown inconsistent results with regard to gender differences. Some surveys have shown comparable levels of violence by both men and women against partners, while other surveys have shown higher levels of violence by men. Approaches using data from reports of domestic violence offenses, for example, agency or hospital samples, tend to show women experiencing violence from male partners as the majority of cases (80–90%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Research based on the [[statistical survey|survey]]-based [[Conflict Tactics Scale]], a measure of intrafamily conflict and violence focusing on the adults in the family developed by Murray Straus (1979){{Clarify|date=May 2008}}, includes national surveys on the prevalence of domestic violence in the United States and other countries. These include the two U.S. National Family Violence Surveys (1975 and 1985)&lt;ref&gt;http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB23.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000). The National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) found that women experience more intimate partner violence than do men, women experience more chronic and injurious physical assaults at the hands of intimate partners than do men, and that violence perpetrated against women by intimates is often accompanied by emotionally abusive and controlling behavior (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000).

Research based on reported domestic violence or on police records show men to be the perpetrators, and women the victims, of most reported domestic violence. However, the intervention of police may introduce a degree of gender bias into reporting. When faced with an uncertain domestic violence situation, removing one party will often defuse an altercation. Police officers may find it easier to take action against a man. This may be due to gender expectations, reinforced by previous incidents.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} . Additionally, removing the woman may entail involving other social services to care for any existing children for a time, something that may not be in the children's best interests, or may cause a significant delay. The fact that non-domestic offending is often committed by males may also influence an officer's decision.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Police responding to a complaint may act more favorably to the complainant than other parties (though some researchers report instances where men were attacked, called the police instead of fighting back, yet were arrested themselves). Some researchers have found that women are more likely to report domestic violence to police than men are. In Ireland, 29% of female victims and 5% of male victims of domestic abuse reported the abuse to the police.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1b&gt;"[http://www.gov.ie/crimecouncil/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf 36091 NCC Doc.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202916/http://www.gov.ie/crimecouncil/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |date=December 3, 2007 }}". www.gov.ie.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, male victims are less likely than female victims to report rape, physical assault, or stalking.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/181867.pdf Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence (NCJ 181867)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Injury and hospital admission statistics suggest that males are more frequently the perpetrators of injury causing violence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} However, both the difference in likelihood of reporting noted above, and the relative strength difference between males and females, could be factors in this reporting bias, as males may be more likely to injure females in otherwise equivalent circumstances.

===Under-reporting===

The problem of [[under-reporting]] to police is believed to be substantial. However, estimates about how much domestic violence is not reported vary widely. It must also be remembered that a significant amount of non-domestic violence crime is also not reported to police. Depending on what statistics are chosen, anywhere between a tenth of incidents and nothing significantly less than what would be expected for any other incident are reported to police.{{Clarify|date=May 2008}}

Many crime victimization surveys, from many countries, do show that there is a correlation between the under-reporting of crime and the degree of intimacy between the victim and the offender. The degree of seriousness of offending also affects reporting, with less serious offending less likely to be reported to police. Also the nature of the offending affects reporting, with sexual offenses far less likely to be reported, even when they are serious.

== International levels ==
The [[World Conference on Human Rights]], held in Vienna in 1993, and the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that violence against women is a public health and human rights concern. Work in this area has resulted in the establishment of international standards, but the task of documenting the magnitude of violence against women and producing reliable, comparative data to guide policy and monitor implementation has been exceedingly difficult.

The World Health Organisation Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women 2005 is a response to this difficulty. Published in 2005 it is a groundbreaking study which analysed data from 10 countries and sheds new light on the prevalence of violence against women. It seeks to look at violence against women a public health policy perspective. The findings will be used to inform a more effective response from government, including the health, justice and social service sectors, as a step towards fulfilling the state's obligation to eliminate violence against women under international human rights laws.

===Europe===

According to the survey, 312,000 women and 93,000 men were victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1107.pdf Crime in England and Wales 2006/07&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122085133/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1107.pdf |date=November 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====

In Canada, the Assembly of First Nations evaluation of the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program conducted by CIET offers an inclusive and relatively unbiased national estimate. It documented domestic violence in a random sample of 85 First Nations across Canada: 22% (523/2359) of mothers reported suffering abuse in the year prior to being interviewed; of these, 59% reported physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson N, Nahwegahbow A | year = 2010 | title = Family violence and the need for prevention research in First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities.

Results of studies which estimate the prevalence of domestic violence vary significantly, depending on specific wording of survey questions, how the survey is conducted, the definition of abuse or domestic violence used, the willingness or unwillingness of victims to admit that they have been abused and other factors. For instance, Straus (2005) conducted a study which estimated that the rate of minor assaults by women in the United States was 78 per 1,000 couples, compared with a rate for men of 72 per 1,000 and the severe assault rate was 46 per 1,000 couples for assaults by women and 50 per 1,000 for assaults by men. Neither difference is statistically significant. He claimed that since these rates were based exclusively on information provided by women respondents, the near-equality in assault rates could not be attributed to a gender bias in reporting.&lt;ref name="Straus, 2005"&gt;Straus, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One analysis found that "women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, studies have shown that women are more likely to be injured.

A Canadian study showed that 7% of women and 6% of men were abused by their current or former partners, but female victims of spousal violence were more than twice as likely to be injured as male victims, three times more likely to fear for their life, twice as likely to be stalked, and twice as likely to experience more than ten incidents of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/14/domestic-violence-050714.html |title=CBC News&amp;nbsp;– Canada&amp;nbsp;– Domestic violence rate unchanged, Statistics Canada finds |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Straus notes that Canadian studies on domestic violence have simply excluded questions that ask men about being victimized by their wives.&lt;ref name="Straus, 2005"/&gt;

According to a 2004 survey in Canada, the percentages of males being physically or sexually victimized by their partners was 6% versus 7% for women. However, females reported higher levels of repeated violence and were more likely than men to experience serious injuries; 23% of females versus 15% of males were faced with the most serious forms of violence including being beaten, choked, or threatened with or having a gun or knife used against them. Also, 21% of women versus 11% of men were likely to report experiencing more than 10 violent incidents. Women who often experience higher levels of physical or sexual violence from their current partner, were 44%, compared with 18% of men to suffer from an injury. Cases in which women are faced with extremely abusive partners, results in the females having to fear for their lives due to the violence they had faced. In addition, statistics show that 34% of women feared for their lives, and 10% of men feared for theirs.&lt;ref name=grady&gt;O'Grady William (2011).

Victims of DV are offered legal remedies, which include the criminal law, as well as obtaining a [[protection order]]. The remedies offered can be both of a civil nature (civil orders of protection and other protective services) and of a criminal nature (charging the perpetrator with a criminal offense).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32038">'''Escalation of commitment''' is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some [[Decision-making|decision]], action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=C7KbGmTg3qUC|page=191}} |chapter=The escalation of commitment: An update and appraisal|editor1-last=Shapira|editor1-first=Zur|title=Organizational Decision Making|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=191–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists and [[behavioral scientists]] use a related term, ''sunk-cost fallacy'', to describe the justification of increased [[investment]] of money, time, lives, etc. in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment ("[[sunk cost]]") despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, beginning immediately, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

In [[sociology]], ''irrational escalation of commitment'' or ''commitment bias'' describe similar behaviours. The phenomenon and the sentiment underlying it are reflected in such proverbial images as "throwing good money after bad", "in for a penny, in for a pound", and "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again".

== Early use ==
Escalation of commitment was first described by Barry M. Staw in his 1976 paper, "Knee deep in the big muddy: A study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action".&lt;ref name=Staw1976&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|title=Knee-deep in the big muddy: a study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1976|volume=16|issue=1|pages=27–44|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(76)90005-2|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.3668&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers, inspired by the work of Staw, conducted studies that tested factors, situations and causes of escalation of commitment. The research introduced other analyses of situations and how people approach problems and make decisions. Some of the earliest work stemmed from events in which this phenomenon had an effect and help explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Researchers define escalation of commitment ===

Over the past few decades, researchers have followed and analyzed many examples of the escalation of commitment to a situation. The heightened situations are explained in three elements. Firstly, a situation has a costly amount of resources such as time, money and people invested in the project. Next, past behavior leads up to an apex in time where the project has not met expectations or could be in a cautious state of decline. Lastly, these problems all force a decision-maker to make choices that include the options of continuing to pursue a project until completion by adding additional costs, or canceling the project altogether.&lt;ref name="Moon2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Henry|title=The two faces of conscientiousness: Duty and achievement striving in escalation of commitment dilemmas|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2001|volume=86|issue=3|pages=533–540|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also developed an argument regarding how  escalation of commitment is observed in two different categories.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brockner|first1=Joel|title=The escalation of commitment to a failing course of action: toward theoretical progress|journal=Academy of Management Review|date=1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=39–61|doi=10.5465/AMR.1992.4279568|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311233821/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers believe that the need to escalate resources is linked to [[expectancy theory]]. "According to such a viewpoint, decision makers assess the probability that additional resource allocations will lead to goal attainment, as well as the value of goal attainment (i.e., rewards minus costs), and thereby generate a subjective expected utility associated with the decision to allocate additional resources."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The next phase of the escalation process is self-justification and rationalizing if the decision the leader made used resources well, if the resources being used were used to make positive change, and assuring themselves that the decision they chose was right. Leaders must balance costs and benefits of any problem to produce a final decision. What matters most often in assuring the leader that they made the right choice regardless of the final outcome is if their decision is what others believed in.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Research conducted on the topic has been taken from many other forms and theories of psychology. Many believe that what researchers have done thus far to explain this behavior is best analyzed  and tested through situational development and resource allocation.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Other research has identified circumstances that lead to the opposite of escalation of commitment, namely deescalation of commitment. This research explains the factors that influence whether escalation or deescalation of commitment is more likely to occur through the role of budgeting and mental accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Chip. "Escalation and de-escalation of commitment in response to sunk costs: The role of budgeting in mental accounting." ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'' 62 (1995): 38-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam War ===

Escalation of commitment can many times cause behavior change by means of locking into resources. One of the first examples of escalation of commitment was described by [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]], who wrote to President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to explain to him the predictions of the war outcome:&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

{{quote|The decision you face now is crucial. Once large numbers of U.S. troops are committed to direct combat, they will begin to take heavy casualties in a war they are ill equipped to fight in a noncooperative if not downright hostile countryside. Once we suffer large casualties, we will have started a well-nigh irreversible process. Our involvement will be so great that we cannot—without national humiliation—stop short of achieving our complete objectives. Of the two possibilities, I think humiliation would be more likely than the achievement of our objectives—even after we have paid terrible costs.&lt;ref name="Gettleman1995"&gt;Ball, George (July 1, 1965). "Memo from George Ball to President Johnson. A Compromise Solution in South Vietnam".

== Theories ==
=== Self-justification theory ===

[[Self-justification theory|Self-justification]] thought process is a part of commitment decisions of leaders and managers of a group and can therefore cause a rise in commitment levels.&lt;ref name="Huning2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Impact of Performance Attributions on Escalation of Commitment|last = Huning|first = Tobias M|date = 2014|volume = 18|issue = 1|journal = Journal of Organizational Culture, Communications and Conflict|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Thomson|first2 = Neal F|url = http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623232138/http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf#page=157|archivedate = 2016-06-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude provides "one explanation for why people escalate commitment to their past investments."&lt;ref name="Kelly2013"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Escalation of Commitment|last = Kelly|first = Theresa F|publisher = Sage Publications, Inc|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks, CA|pages =256–259 |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Management Theory|last2 = Milkman|first2 = Katherine L|editor1-last=Kessler|editor1-first= Eric H|doi=10.4135/9781452276090.n78|ISBN= 9781412997829|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4wtzAwAAQBAJ|page=256}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers make decisions that reflect previous behavior. Managers tend to recall and follow information that is aligned to their behavior to create consistency for their current and future decisions. If a group member or outside party recognizes inconsistent decision making, this can alter the leadership role of the manager. Managers have external influence from society, peers, and authority, which can significantly alter a manager's perception on what factors realistically matter when making decisions.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Prospect theory ===

[[Prospect theory]] helps to describe the natural reactions and processes involved in making a decision in a risk-taking situation. Prospect theory makes the argument for how levels of wealth, whether that is people, money, or time, affect how a decision is made. Researchers were particularly interested in how one perceives a situation based on costs and benefits.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The framing to how the problem is introduced is crucial for understanding and thinking of the probability that the situation will either work in favor or against you and how to prepare for those changes. "Whyte (1986) argued that prospect theory provides the psychological mechanism by which to explain escalating commitment to a failing course of action without the need to invoke self-justification processes. (Fiegenbaum &amp; Thomas, 1988: 99)"&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Prospect theorists believe that one's use of this process is when there is a negative downfall in the stakes that will affect the outcome of the project. To ensure they will not fail, the individual may add more resources to assure them that they will succeed. Although this theory seems realistic, researchers "Davis and Bobko (1986) found no effect of personal responsibility on continued commitment to the previous course of action in the positive frame condition."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Which means that escalation of commitment will be lower in the higher responsibility situation.

=== Attribution theory ===

The [[attribution theory]], originating from [[Fritz Heider]], "attempts to find causal explanations for events and human behaviors." This theory approaches two methods of inquiry including locus of causality and stability.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Locus of causality reflects on internal characteristics of an individual, such as intelligence levels and attention seeking, with the relationship of the external space such as weather forecasts and task difficulty.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Aspects of control become a significant factor in how a manager justifies a decision made. Managers will use the relationship between internal and external factors to describe why they made a decision to a single point of view. Managers may justify their actions by explaining that this was out of their personal control of the event, or they could believe that the decision could not be controlled by anyone else. Research suggests that "the type of attribution made by an employee across these dimensions is likely to impact an employee's tendency to engage in the negative emotional activity referred to as escalation of commitment."&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Social identity theory ===

Identity is a large part of how we move through the world. Private thoughts and opinions as well as the effect of others create the [[social identity theory]]. People make connections between their use of groups and their own view of themselves, which researchers have discovered motivates people to keep their social status and to defend it whenever it is endangered.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The escalation of commitment in political decision-making groups: a social identity approach|last = Dietz-Uhler|first = Beth|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1996|volume=26|issue=4|pages=611–629|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199607)26:4&lt;611::AID-EJSP781&gt;3.0.CO;2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical models ===

==== Temporal model of escalation ====
Groups engage in temporal comparisons, which means that you compare actions and behaviors at "different points in time."&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt; This is a form of social identity scenario. This type of comparison can be made when a decision seems unproductive and forces team members to consider any threat to the group.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt;

==== Aggregate model ====
"The aggregate model's emphasis is upon the accumulation and balance of forces rather than the ordering of effects over time."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; The model is general and can provide an ideal view as to how. The effects whether positive or negative are defined by micro and macro forces. This model goes by situation rather than what researchers have defined as the norm. There is no process to follow, which makes it very useful for researchers because they can understand a situation more clearly as well as see the bigger picture of the situation.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Determinants ==
The main drivers of the tendency to continue investing in losing propositions are project, psychological, social, and structural.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleesman|first1=Dustin J.|last2=Conlon|first2=Donald E.|last3=McNamara|first3=Gerry|last4=Miles|first4=Jonathan E.|title=Cleaning Up the Big Muddy: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Determinants of Escalation of Commitment|journal=Academy of Management Journal|date=2012|volume=55|issue=3|pages=541–562|doi=10.5465/amj.2010.0696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project ===

Project determinants are those that refer to the original commitments and decisions made at a project's beginning. This includes general project characteristics and initial financial costs.&lt;ref name="Liang2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liang|first1=Beichen|last2=Kale|first2=Sudhir H.|last3=Cherian|first3=Joseph|title=Is the future static or dynamic? The role of culture on escalation of commitment in new product development|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=155–163|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, decision risk, opportunity cost information, and information acquisition have been found to have negative relationships with escalation of commitment. Decision uncertainty, positive performance trend information, and expressed preference for initial decision have been found to have positive relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

High costs of ending a project or changing its course, potential financial gain upon completion, and extensive structure can factor in to escalation of commitment, making it difficult to walk away from the project. Preventing future monetary loss, potential savings, and having clearly available alternatives can allow for avoidance of the behavior. In studies by Teger and later Ross and Staw, situations where ending an action costs more than completing it resulted in decision makers being trapped in their current, costly behaviors.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt;

=== Psychological ===

Psychological determinants are those that refer to internal views on the actions and information involved in a project. This can include cognitive factors, personality, and emotions as they relate to project elements.&lt;ref name="Liang2014" /&gt; Of these, sunk costs, time investment, decision maker experience and expertise, self-efficacy and confidence, personal responsibility for the initial decision, ego threat, and proximity to project completion have been found to have positive relationships with escalation of commitment, while anticipated regret and positive information framing have been found to have negative relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

Optimism and belief that one has control over what will still be positive outcomes lead to continued self-justification of commitment to actions. People add to their initial personal investments in the hope they will overcome currently negative results. This was illustrated in a case study by Staw, where providing business students with manipulated responsibilities for initial decisions and their outcomes resulted in the greatest commitment to increased actions and resources when the initial decision assigned was made directly by the student with poor outcomes.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt; In these instances, people take further risk in an attempt to avoid further problems. This is even more likely when subjects view current issues as having unstable reasoning rather than stable reasoning, or when the individual is unwilling to admit mistakes.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; They then believe the situation will stabilize or turn around. [[Confirmation bias]] can also lead to escalation of commitment as individuals are then less likely to recognize the negative results of their decisions.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; On the other hand, if the results are recognized, they can be blamed on unforeseeable events occurring during the course of the project.

The effect of sunk costs is often seen escalating commitment. When the amount of investment is greater and can not be recovered, the desire to avoid complete loss of those resources and keeping with impression management prompts continued investment over pulling out.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; Relatedly, as invested resources can include time, closeness to completion of a project yields similar results. More value is placed on project when they are early or late in their process due to the clarity of completion goals at those points.&lt;ref name=Horn2012&gt;{{cite thesis|first1=Marianna|last1=Horn|title=The downside of persistence: The effects of mood on an escalation of commitment paradigm|date=2012|url=https://etd.auburn.edu/handle/10415/3290?show=full|HDL=10415/3290}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's more likely that risks will be taken at these points than in a project closer to a visible midpoint.

=== Social ===

Social determinants are those that refer to the expectations and influence of other individuals or groups on project actions. Included in these, group identity or cohesive strength has been found to have the most influence on escalation of commitment while public evaluation of decision and resistance to decision from others has little significance in relation.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

==== External justification and binding ====
Individuals present themselves cautiously to others in the environment. They don't concentrate on themselves and what they believe is accurate and competent—they are only interested in their organization appearing competent. Escalation of commitment is about decision making that usually comes in a form of a group or individual deciding a course of action. Managers have a responsibility to choose the fate of what a group of people have been working on. A manager who decides to back a team out of a project isn't concerned that the project failed, they are concerned that team members may think the manager is incompetent. Studies that tested this phenomenon included factors such as policy resistance, job insecurity (Fox &amp; Staw 1979), and audience size (Rubin &amp; Lang 1981). All showed a spike in commitment when these realistic factors are present. This mental and emotional response is referred to as the face-saving effect. Individuals who are responsible for others are constantly checking themselves to assure that their actions and beliefs are parallel to the expectations for their viewers. One's social identity to the public can decide your fate. For example, a team can identify a level of commitment and personal connection to an idea or project. Team members consistently use statements like "that project is Bob's baby," or "oh, we had the same idea." Both ends of the spectrum are crucial to how others view and analyze a situation, especially something that failed.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

==== Leadership norms ====
Leaders are responsible for guiding a team through the difficult problems into a solution. Although many times, the negative aspects of commitments can discussed in more detail and importance, there are many social rewards that are positive. One example of this phenomenon is persistence. A project on the verge of failure is a manager's responsibility to revive, but with persistence, a manager can get rewarded to turning a bad project into something great. Rewards are earned for turning around a team to produce something successful. When managers stick to their goals, and get their team to produce responsibly.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Structural ===

Structural determinants are those that refer to the cultural and environmental features and resources of the project's overall organization. The minimal research available on them indicates that agency problems most influence escalation of commitment.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

There are macro-level variables that affect the organizational structure of a team and how the make decisions. Decisions are made based on individuals in a group setting with specific roles and responsibilities and effect decisions that are a product of interaction in the team. The determinant that affects escalation of commitment is institutional inertia. This phenomenon is used to describe how individual attitudes and behavior changes frequently, so therefore, a group's stature is also unpredictable and controllable. "Organizations have very imperfect sensory systems, making them relatively impervious to changes in their environments."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This is one factor that plays a role in how issues are addressed. When there are a group of individuals involved in communication, decisions, and change, with the lack of consistency in the group, most of the tasks fail to complete. This phenomenon occurs in situations such as policy change, rulings and procedures.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This issue can also cause havoc for an organization when they are too attached to a policy, thought process or identity because they are not free to change. "On occasion, a project, product, or policy can become so closely tied to the values and purposes of the organization that it becomes almost unthinkable to consider withdrawal."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; One primary example of this phenomenon is the downfall of the [[Pan American World Airways]] company, commonly known as Pan Am. Pan Am was a well known airlines and hotel with hundreds of employees. With the turn of industry, airline policies were deregulated and caused financial downfall for Pan Am. The company over time made cuts to their company to stay afloat. The company believed that their image of being an airline was more important than being a successful company that they removed all of the assets that were in fact making them the largest amount of revenue only to save the image they thought they needed to remain to be Pan Am.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Groups vs individuals ==
In groups, it can be more difficult to attribute issues to a single, simpler determinant. While determinants are still applicable, oftentimes there are more complex factors when organizational goals and actions misalign. Groups, especially as they grow larger, can be resistant to changing course.

Even if the need to change course or cease action is recognized, communication speed, policies, and business politics can be hindrances.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; A larger organization, especially one with a spread of subgroups, has to communicate the argument and decision to go against previous actions across the appropriate levels. If this communication does not occur in a timely manner or is blocked, the final decision may not be made and acted upon. A decision that goes against existing rules and processes may also reach resistance even with support from those within the organization. Individuals and groups that are directly employed due to a project, have financial stake in it may provide enough opposition to prevent changes from being made as well. They feel personally responsible for the parts they've worked on and can also feel that they too are being replaced or terminated.&lt;ref name="Stray2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stray|first1=Viktoria Gulliksen|last2=Moe|first2=Nils Brede|last3=Dybå|first3=Tore|chapter=Escalation of Commitment: A Longitudinal Case Study of Daily Meetings|date=2012|volume=111|pages=153–167|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-30350-0_11|title=Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming|ISBN=978-3-642-30349-4|series= Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escalation of commitment can then occur in any of these situations. External groups can play an even larger part in escalating commitment if their power is greater than that of the group taking action and they use that power to directly lead and influence.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

With a larger number of decision makers included, groups have the opportunity for greater productivity than single individuals, but they also have the opportunity for greater losses and escalation.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=Max H.|last2=Giuliano|first2=Toni|last3=Appelman|first3=Alan|title=Escalation of commitment in individual and group decision making|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1984|volume=33|issue=2|pages=141–152|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(84)90017-5|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318080454/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members can eliminate some of the escalation potential if they come to a better decision earlier on in the process and avoid the need to change course dramatically. Yet they can also hold onto a larger base of support for their initial actions to the point where escalation potential is increased. In this case, [[groupthink]] assists in keeping with the original decision and pressures towards conformity rather than dividing the group with other options. Also, a group whose members are not cohesive can have decreased escalation potential due to conflicts and varying levels of inclusion in the process.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984" /&gt;

Organizations that are family businesses are especially prone to escalation of commitment due to the added level of going through the family structure in addition to the business structure, allowing for further conflicts between the two.&lt;ref name="Woods2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woods|first1=Jeremy A.|last2=Dalziel|first2=Thomas|last3=Barton|first3=Sidney L.|title=Escalation of commitment in private family businesses: The influence of outside board members|journal=Journal of Family Business Strategy|date=2012|volume=3|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1016/j.jfbs.2012.01.002|url=http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504212721/http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business reputation, customer and share loss, and financial loss become risks.

===The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce===

The issue of divorce is a crucial aspect in the society in relations to the life of children. The separation of a married couple due to irreconcilable differences is a matter that is common in the society and its effects on children is negative. It will impact negatively on the education of the children, health conditions of the children, children's relation with their parents as well as the future well-being of the children (Amato, 2000). Therefore, the area relating to the effects of divorce on children is significant for academic inquiry. It makes sense to research on this particular area since it will help learn on the effects that comes with divorce, how children adjust and adapt to divorce and how they are being treated.  It is also worth to mention that, parents who divorce have their minds lingering on how their actions will affect their children's happiness as well as health.

====A review of how the study is to be conducted====

In attempting to explain how divorce will affect children, it is necessary for a research to first examine and categorize children in groups which will make it easy to carry out the study. This is because children will be affected differently by divorce depending on the age factor. It becomes even wise for a researcher to adopt the following groups: pre-schoolers (nine years and below), adolescents (9–13 years) and youths/young adults (14–25 years). The research will become more attainable if carried out using learning institutions which will include pre-schools, secondary schools and colleges. Therefore, a city within a state is selected where the research will be conducted and a preschool, one secondary school and one college is selected within the city where respondents (children) are found.
Objectives becomes necessary for the study. This will allow a research to focus on certain areas and completely address the matter at hand without leaving gaps in the area of research. In addressing the topic, ‘The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce,’ the following research objectives can be used:
*To examine ways in which pre-schoolers are affected by absence of parent following divorce.
*To examine ways in which adolescents are affected by absence of parent following divorce.
*To examine ways in which young adults are affected by absence of parent following divorce.
*To examine ways of reducing effects of absence of parent following divorce on children.
Research questions are also vital in this study. They offer guidelines on realizing the objectives of the study. At the conclusion, a researcher will review the research questions and establish whether they have been answered or not. The topic under study here will encompass the following research questions:
*How does absence of parent following divorce affect pre-schoolers?
*How does absence of parent following divorce affect adolescence?
*How does absence of parent following divorce affect young adults?
*How can effects of absence of parent following divorce be reduced?
It is also necessary that significance of the study be stated by a researcher which will make the research meaningful. In line with this topic, parents will be informed of the underlying behaviours of children as a result of absence of parent following divorce. The study will also enlighten parents on the roles they play to shape their children when they live as a couple, therefore, parents will try to their best to reconcile their differences and live as one. The challenges that young adults at the age of 14 to 25 years and whose parents divorced faces as they enter into romantic relationships are revealed. The aim of the study is to explore knowledge relating to counselling of such cases.
The study will be easier when the scope is mentioned. This is the area the study will cover or rather the number of respondents. The study on ‘The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce,’ will be focus on pre-schoolers, adolescents as well as young adults in a particular area which can be certain learning institutions within a specific city. There are also certain assumptions which a researcher will have to make in this study. For example, it will be assumed that at the time the research will be done. All the learning institutions will be on session and can be accessed and that the respondents will be willing to share the information required.

As part of the research, a literature review is necessary. This will involve carrying out various theoretical reviews to examine various theories related to the topic under study. Such theories will include attachment theory, social learning theory, among many others. The theories will lay a foundation to the topic. Moreover, empirical review is another part of literature review where various literary works carried out by other researchers relating to the topic of study are examined in detail.

Research methodology will consist of the research design suitable for the topic of study, the target population, the sampling design, data collection and data analysis.  The research design in relation to the topic of this study will be descriptive survey design. The target population will consist of all the students in the learning institutions selected that will be used for the research. Stratified sampling design is suitable for the study since data will be collected and based on three strata; pre-schoolers, secondary and college. Data collection will be by use of questionnaires and finally, data analysis will be both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative will encompass such descriptive statistics as mean and standard deviation while the qualitative will take into account attaching significance to the themes as well as the patterns observed (Bryman, 2008).
The results and findings will be finally presented summarizing the information obtained from data collection and analysed. The summary of the findings will provide answers to the research questions, reveal the challenges experienced throughout the research and expose gabs that can aid in further research concerning the topic.
The research especially when administering questionnaires and interviews if any should be carried out in a manner which is within two key aspects: conforming to ethical practices and adhering to approved protocol. Ethical practices in research are very vital and plays a very important role in protecting the rights and privacy of the respondents. The use of human subjects is a critical ethical consideration. This study will have to adhere to the guidelines set by Institutional Review Board of the schools which data will be collected.  The board is composed of people who will check to ensure that the information gathered from the respondents are safe and that human rights of the respondents are not violated in any case. The ethical considerations that are relevant to this study will involve voluntary participation by the respondents and the informed consent (Vanclay, 2013).
It is important to note that ethical standards very important roles in this research work. They guarantee that all human subjects that become respondents in the study accepted freely and willfully to participate and that they have been fully updated on the purpose of the research. Moreover, the subjects’ confidentiality and anonymity is highly protected.&lt;ref&gt;Amato, P.R. (2000). The consequences of divorce for adults and children.

In regard to the effects of father absence, a recent British study&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; assessed child problem behaviour in over 15,000 families using the clinical cut-offs of the [[Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire|Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]], controlling for household factors such as resources, parental mental health and inter-parental relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fomby|first=Paula|last2=Osborne|first2=Cynthia|date=2010-11-01|title=The influence of union instability and union quality on children’s aggressive behavior|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X10000116|journal=Social Science Research|volume=39|issue=6|pages=912–924|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.02.006|pmc=3302180|pmid=22423167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Julia S.|last2=Carlson|first2=Marcia J.|date=2014-08-01|title=Parents' Relationship Quality and Children's Behavior in Stable Married and Cohabiting Families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12120/abstract|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|language=en|volume=76|issue=4|pages=762–777|doi=10.1111/jomf.12120|issn=1741-3737|pmc=4128411|pmid=25125703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that father absence at a given age, similar to poverty and parental psychological distress, predicted a high probability of the child scoring above the cut-off score for total difficulties two years later. Likewise, father absence predicted several specific difficulties including [[borderline personality disorder]], severe [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|hyperactivity]] and abnormal emotional problems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Reciprocally, a child's severe externalising and social during their preschool years were also associated with a greater probability of the father being absent two years later. The authors concluded that father absence seemed to be more of a cause than a consequence of child problem behaviour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Through direct interaction, fathers’ involvement in children's development has a positive influence on their social, behavioural and psychological outcomes. In general, engagement of a fatherly figure reduces the frequency of behavioural problems and [[juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] in sons and psychological problems in daughters, all the while facilitating children's [[cognitive development]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarkadi|first=Anna|last2=Kristiansson|first2=Robert|last3=Oberklaid|first3=Frank|last4=Bremberg|first4=Sven|date=2008-02-01|title=Fathers' involvement and children's developmental outcomes: a systematic review of longitudinal studies|journal=Acta Paediatrica|volume=97|issue=2|pages=153–158|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00572.x|issn=0803-5253|pmid=18052995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=East|first=Leah|last2=Jackson|first2=Debra|last3=O'Brien|first3=Louise|date=2006-12-01|title=Father absence and adolescent development: a review of the literature|url=http://chc.sagepub.com/content/10/4/283|journal=Journal of Child Health Care|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=283–295|doi=10.1177/1367493506067869|issn=1367-4935|pmid=17101621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches ==

=== Evolutionary approach ===
[[Life history theory|Evolutionary life-history theory]] postulates that women may [[Parental investment|invest]] more in their offspring than the opposite gender due to a slower rate of reproduction in females.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. (1972). [http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf Parental investment and sexual selection]. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual selection and the descent of man'' (pp. 136-179). London: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists add that the assured maternal relatedness to one's offspring may also make women invest more than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=R. D.|date=1974-01-01|title=The Evolution of Social Behavior|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.es.05.110174.001545|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=5|issue=1|pages=325–383|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.05.110174.001545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Kermyt G.|last2=Kaplan|first2=Hillard|last3=Lancaster|first3=Jane B.|title=Confidence of paternity, divorce, and investment in children by Albuquerque men|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513806000705|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because some men may have variable paternity confidence that the child is his offspring. In light of this, some researchers argue that assured maternal relatedness, together with the lower variance in female [[reproductive success]], may lead parents to bias investment towards female offspring under less favourable household conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|last2=Willard|first2=Dan E.|date=1973-01-05|title=Natural Selection of Parental Ability to Vary the Sex Ratio of Offspring|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/179/4068/90|journal=Science|language=en|volume=179|issue=4068|pages=90–92|doi=10.1126/science.179.4068.90|issn=0036-8075|pmid=4682135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, father absence and the associated socioeconomic constraints it puts on the household may pose a greater risk to sons’ rather than daughters’ survival.

=== Psychodynamic approach ===
The [[psychodynamic approach]] posits that behaviour is motivated by [[basic needs]], and [[Drive theory|drives]] and is sometimes shaped by [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] childhood experiences. It is implicated that for a child to develop a “normal” gender identity, they will have to be raised in a conventional family where there is a father and a mother. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] believed that being parented by a single mother could confuse the child's identity or lead them to become [[Homosexuality|homosexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The psychoanalytic theory of male homosexuality|last=Kenneth|first=Lewes|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1988|isbn=0671623915|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father absence may hinder the son's acquisition of the traditional masculine role, as he is not able to model his own behaviour and attitude on his fathers’. Along similar lines, sons with absent fathers could have confused gender identities – if the son was separated from his father by age four, he would be less assertive, less involved in sport, less masculine than other boys and more dependent on his peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HETHERINGTON|first=E. MAVIS|last2=DEUR|first2=JAN L.|date=1971-01-01|title=The Effects of Father Absence on Child Development|jstor=42643357|journal=Young Children|volume=26|issue=4|pages=233–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, findings of certain empirical studies on psychosexual gender identification have been deemed contradictory and inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golombok|first=S.|last2=Rust|first2=J.|date=1986-12-01|title=The Warnock Report and single women: what about the children?|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|volume=12|issue=4|pages=182–186|issn=0306-6800|pmc=1375380|pmid=3806629|doi=10.1136/jme.12.4.182}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have highlighted such negative consequences of the two-parent heterosexual household on children. Contrarily, others have pointed out that being reared in [[lesbian]] and single-parent households where the father was absent did not affect the psychosexual development of children, despite higher aggressiveness and submissiveness and lower assertiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golombok|first=Susan|last2=Spencer|first2=Ann|last3=Rutter|first3=Michael|date=1983-10-01|title=Children in Lesbian and Single-Parent Households: Psychosexual and Psychiatric Appraisal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1983.tb00132.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=551–572|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1983.tb00132.x|issn=1469-7610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological approach ===
Genes and hormones may account for the tendency of fathers to be absent. Certain DNA patterns have been shown to affect an individual's degree of [[fidelity]] and investment in their offspring. In particular, a study in [[prairie vole]]s indicates that the gene [[Arginine vasopressin receptor 1A|AVPR1A]] affects the activity of [[vasopressin]] receptors in brain regions and thus predicts less cheating on their partners.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okhovat|first=Mariam|last2=Berrio|first2=Alejandro|last3=Wallace|first3=Gerard|last4=Ophir|first4=Alexander G.|last5=Phelps|first5=Steven M.|date=2015-12-11|title=Sexual fidelity trade-offs promote regulatory variation in the prairie vole brain|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1371|journal=Science|language=en|volume=350|issue=6266|pages=1371–1374|doi=10.1126/science.aac5791|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26659055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[oxytocin]], the hormone vasopressin can facilitate trust, empathy and social bonding. Injection of vasopressin in [[Polygamy|polygamous]] [[montane vole]]s significantly increased their likelihood of becoming [[Monogamy|monogamous]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This may in turn decrease their likelihood of being an absent father.

A meta-analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klahr|first=Ashlea M.|last2=Burt|first2=S. Alexandra|title=Elucidating the etiology of individual differences in parenting: A meta-analysis of behavioral genetic research.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0034205|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=140|issue=2|pages=544–586|doi=10.1037/a0034205|pmid=24016230}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on 56 [[Twin study|twin]] and [[Adoption study|adoption studies]] totalling over 200,000 families has revealed that genetic makeup significantly affects the individual's parenting behaviour. Genes in the father reliability predict up to 40% of his positive or negative emotions towards his children. In this sense, genes contribute to a father's liking or repulsion for his children, the latter of which may result in father absence.

== Gender differences ==
There is mixed empirical evidence on the relative impact of father absence on the development of male and female offspring. A recent study in rural [[Ethiopia]], where father absence could mean a significant drop in household income, revealed a considerable difference between the wellbeing of male and female offspring.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Mhairi A.|date=2008-07-22|title=Does Investment in the Sexes Differ When Fathers Are Absent?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-008-9044-2|journal=Human Nature|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=263–276|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9044-2|issn=1045-6767}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the author found that a male infant's risk of dying per month was doubled if the biological father was absent – a 30% greater risk than that for females. For female infants, father absence (as opposed to presence) was associated with a lower risk of dying, as well as higher nutritional status. That is to say, father absence was only a statistical predictor of infant death only for male infants. Such a gender difference has been observed despite a strong [[Son preference|cultural preference for sons]] in the area. On the other hand, in developed countries such as the United Kingdom where father absence may not inflict as much harm on the family's income, the effects of father absence are not noticeably gendered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In attempting to explain how divorce will affect children, it is necessary for a research to first examine and categorize children in groups which will make it easy to carry out the study. This is because children will be affected differently by divorce depending on the age factor. It becomes even wise for a researcher to adopt the following groups: pre-schoolers (nine years and below), adolescents (9-13 years) and youths/young adults (14-25 years). The research will become more attainable if carried out using learning institutions which will include pre-schools, secondary schools and colleges. Therefore, a city within a state is selected where the research will be conducted and a preschool, one secondary school and one college is selected within the city where respondents (children) are found.
Objectives becomes necessary for the study. This will allow a research to focus on certain areas and completely address the matter at hand without leaving gaps in the area of research. In addressing the topic, ‘The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce,’ the following research objectives can be used:

An early menarche can increase the chance of [[fertility]], while other short-term reproductive strategies can diversify the genes inherited in offspring. These could lift up a higher success rate of rearing children to adolescence. Moreover, the stress of father absence prompts girls to develop a variety of internalising disorders, such as [[bulimia]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], which may lower the person's [[metabolism]] leading to excessive weight gain which  precipitates early menarche.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplowitz|first=Paul B.|date=2008-02-01|title=Link Between Body Fat and the Timing of Puberty|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/Supplement_3/S208|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=121|issue=Supplement 3|pages=S208–S217|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-1813F|issn=0031-4005|pmid=18245513}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study shows that there are fewer monitored meals in the father-absent household.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Videon|first=Tami M|last2=Manning|first2=Carolyn K|title=Influences on adolescent eating patterns: the importance of family meals|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1054139X02007115|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=32|issue=5|pages=365–373|doi=10.1016/s1054-139x(02)00711-5|pmid=12729986|date=May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having meals in the family is arguably more beneficial to children than is eating alone (i.e. solitary eating), as the former lowers the chance of [[obesity]].

Since mother absence does not predict weight gain in children, it seems that the increase in the child's body weight observed is due to the isolated genetic influence of an absent father, rather than the global environmental stress cause by the absence of either parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=W.|last2=Zhao|first2=L.-J.|last3=Liu|first3=Y.-Z.|last4=Recker|first4=R.

A specialised mechanism to deal with mother absence has never been developed.

In addition, recent findings seem to regard genes, rather than the environment, as the mechanism underlying the positive correlation between high [[body mass index]] and earlier first menarche onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Family composition, stress, and the timing of human menarche.

=== Sexual behaviour ===

Father absence in a household can result in children (of both sexes) having earlier average ages of first sexual intercourse than those raised in father present households. There is also the effect of increased rates of teenage [[pregnancy]]. Some evolutionary theories propose that early childhood is vital for encoding information that shapes future reproductive strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belsky|first=Jay|last2=Steinberg|first2=Laurence D.|last3=Houts|first3=Renate M.|last4=Friedman|first4=Sarah L.|last5=DeHart|first5=Ganie|last6=Cauffman|first6=Elizabeth|last7=Roisman|first7=Glenn I.|last8=Halpern-Felsher|first8=Bonnie L.|last9=Susman|first9=Elisabeth|date=2007-08-01|title=Family rearing antecedents of pubertal timing|journal=Child Development|volume=78|issue=4|pages=1302–1321|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01067.x|issn=0009-3920|pmid=17650140}}&lt;/ref&gt; in regulating physical and motivational pathways of sexual behaviour. Conflicting and stressful parental relationships can lead children to believe that resources are limited, people are untrustworthy, and relationships are opportunistic. As they replicate their parents’ mating-oriented reproductive behaviour, they tend to have multiple sexual partners and erratic relationships. Children implicitly and explicitly model their sexual attitudes and behaviours on their parents, see engagement in non-marital sex as normative. Father absence however can be a byproduct of initial social and economic strain within the household (e.g. violence, lack of educational opportunities and cumulative life exposure to poverty can increase the likelihood of early sexual endeavours and pregnancy). The timing of first intercourse can be heritable - shorter [[alleles]] of the X-linked androgen receptor (AR) gene has been associated with aggression, impulsivity, high number of sexual partners, divorce in males and earlier ages of physical maturation in females.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Mechanisms to balance father absence ==

=== Matrilineal support ===

Despite being poorer overall, [[widow]]ed and [[divorce]]d women are on average 2.4&amp;nbsp;kg heavier than women whose children's fathers are present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Widowed and divorced mothers as well as their daughters are reported to have substantially improved [[nutrition]]al status which could be explained by them having greater access to the mother's relatives ([[matrilateral]] kin). Furthermore, proximity to a mother's relatives can dramatically improve female children's height for age, an indicator of good nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Mhairi A.|last2=Mace|first2=Ruth|title=Helpful grandmothers in rural Ethiopia: A study of the effect of kin on child survival and growth|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513805000206|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=6|pages=469–482|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who return to their village of birth following marital dissolution are seen to benefit from extra matrilateral kin support,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulder|first=Monique Borgerhoff|date=1998-06-01|title=Brothers and sisters|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-998-1001-6|journal=Human Nature|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–161|doi=10.1007/s12110-998-1001-6|issn=1045-6767}}&lt;/ref&gt; which replaces the help of the missing husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hadza grandmothers as helpers: Residence data.

In line with this topic, parents will be informed of the underlying behaviours of children as a result of absence of parent following divorce. The study will also enlighten parents on the roles they play to shape their children when they live as a couple, therefore, parents will try to their best to reconcile their differences and live as one. The challenges that young adults at the age of 14 to 25 years and whose parents divorced faces as they enter into romantic relationships are revealed. The aim of the study is to explore knowledge relating to counselling of such cases.
The study will be easier when the scope is mentioned. This is the area the study will cover or rather the number of respondents. The study on ‘The effect on children of an absent parent following divorce,’ will be focus on pre-schoolers, adolescents as well as young adults in a particular area which can be certain learning institutions within a specific city. There are also certain assumptions which a researcher will have to make in this study. For example, it will be assumed that at the time the research will be done. All the learning institutions will be on session and can be accessed and that the respondents will be willing to share the information required.

As part of the research, a literature review is necessary. This will involve carrying out various theoretical reviews to examine various theories related to the topic under study. Such theories will include attachment theory, social learning theory, among many others. The theories will lay a foundation to the topic. Moreover, empirical review is another part of literature review where various literary works carried out by other researchers relating to the topic of study are examined in detail.

The research design in relation to the topic of this study will be descriptive survey design. The target population will be all the students in the learning institutions selected that will be used for the research. Stratified sampling design is suitable for the study since data will be collected and based on three strata; pre-schoolers, secondary and college. Data collection will be by use of questionnaires and finally, data analysis will be both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative will encompass such descriptive statistics as mean and standard deviation while the qualitative will take into account attaching significance to the themes as well as the patterns observed (Bryman, 2008).
The results and findings will be finally presented summarizing the information obtained from data collection and analysed. The summary of the findings will provide answers to the research questions, reveal the challenges experienced throughout the research and expose gabs that can aid in further research concerning the topic.

The research especially when administering questionnaires and interviews if any should be carried out in a manner which is within two key aspects: conforming to ethical practices and adhering to approved protocol. Ethical practices in research are very vital and plays a very important role in protecting the rights and privacy of the respondents. The use of human subjects is a critical ethical consideration. This study will have to adhere to the guidelines set by Institutional Review Board of the schools which data will be collected.  The board is composed of people who will check to ensure that the information gathered from the respondents are safe and that human rights of the respondents are not violated in any case. The ethical considerations that are relevant to this study will involve voluntary participation by the respondents and the informed consent (Vanclay, 2013).
It is important to note that ethical standards very important roles in this research work. They guarantee that all human subjects that become respondents in the study accepted freely and wilfully to participate and that they have been fully updated on the purpose of the research. Moreover, the subjects’ confidentiality and anonymity is highly protected.

=== Presence of a stepfather ===

In light of certain research, father absence can be disadvantageous; certain evidence suggests stepfather presence does not reduce these disadvantages but in fact has a worsening effect on such issues. For example, the [[Cinderella effect]], which refers to the observation that stepchildren are at a dramatically increased risk of physical abuse and homicide than children living with their biological parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Martin|last2=Wilson|first2=Margo|title=The truth about cinderella : a Darwinian view of parental love|date=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300080298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flinn|first1=Mark V.|title=Step- and genetic parent/offspring relationships in a Caribbean village|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|date=November 1988|volume=9|issue=6|pages=335–369|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(88)90026-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilton|first1=N.

In accordance with their findings, results show that girls raised in families with stepfathers exhibit a significantly earlier age of menarche than girls raised without stepfathers.

Relative to other groups, children with a constantly absent biological father but a stepfather present reported more frequent incidences of [[sexual intercourse]], as well as an earlier onset of sexual behaviour. The mean age of children with their biological father absent or partially absent is approximately 15. A higher percentage of children with a constantly absent biological father reported having sexual intercourse than those in the partially absent group. Those with a stepfather present and those with a biological father always absent have the earliest first time experiences of sexual intercourse at on average 15.11 years old, whereas children without a stepfather or their biological father partially absent at the age of 15.38 experience their first encounter of sexual intercourse. The effect of having a partially absent biological father with stepfather absence and the effect both stepfather or biological father absence are the same. This study indicated that the presence of a stepfather is not compensating to the disadvantages of a biological father being absent. In some situations, it can cause an even bigger negative effect on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendle|first=Jane|last2=Harden|first2=K.

[[File:Henry Thompson MRCVS.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Henry Thompson, author and vetinerary surgeon]]
'''Henry Thompson (MRCVS)''' (Member of the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]], 1836–1920) was a founder member of the Aspatria Agricultural Society, the [[Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society]] and the [[Aspatria Agricultural College]].

==Early life and education==
Henry Thompson was born at [[Allonby]], [[Cumberland]], on 9 September 1836, the youngest of seven children, his father a poor country tailor, earned 9s (45p) per week. At the age of thirteen Thompson became apprentice to Joseph Slee, a [[Maryport]] druggist, working from four in the morning to nine in the evening. He later moved to [[Whitehaven]] to learn [[veterinary]] practice under John Fisher, the most qualified veterinary surgeon in Cumberland. After a further two years learning the basic practical skills associated with the equerry business at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], he enrolled at the Edinburgh Veterinary College, where he studied under Professor William Dick (1793–1866), the founder of the [[Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies]]. After five years of intensive study he graduated with several coveted qualifications; the Diploma of the Highland and Agricultural Society, the examination of the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]], and the Royal Diploma. He became one of only two veterinary surgeons in Cumberland, to hold both Diploma's by examination. He obtained many academic distinctions including two silver medals for [[Anatomy]] and [[Physiology]], and both first and second class certificates for [[Chemistry]], [[Histology]] and [[Pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;West Cumberland Times 21 July 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural progress==
On 4 June 1860, he arrived at [[Aspatria]] with ‘half-a-crown’ (12.5p) in his pocket to take up the position of junior partner in the towns veterinary practice. He befriended [[Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet of Brayton]] and together they became two of the prominent members of the [[Wigton]], and later Aspatria Farmers Club. In 1869, along with William Norman and John Twentyman, the ‘dauntless three’ as they became known, he organised the annual Aspatria Agricultural Show. In the following year the trio founded the [[Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society]] and in 1874 they established the Aspatria Agricultural and Commercial School, later renamed the Aspatria Agricultural College. In 1893, after the sale of the Agricultural School the outgoing directors and [[shareholders]] acknowledged his many hours of unpaid tuition with the presentation of a piano, and a gold watch.&lt;ref&gt;West Cumberland Times 12 August 1893&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional triumphs==
He had many professional triumphs. He was one of the first to experiment with salt as a dressing on the land as a means of destroying insect pests. During his experiments he also discovered that salt acted as a deterrent to other parasitic and microbial diseases, such as ‘red water’ in cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1840), p.265&lt;/ref&gt; He also anticipated the cure of [[milk fever]] in cattle,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1840), pp.314-5&lt;/ref&gt; a discovery later attributed to the [[Danish people|Danish]] biologist Karl Schmidt. In 1895 he enjoyed a degree of success in the treatment of [[foot and mouth]], having seen many cases of the disease, and noted the heavy loss of cattle particularly when calving.
As a writer he was an authority on veterinary and agricultural matters. For over forty years he edited the periodical, ‘North British Agriculturist’. His book entitled, Elementary Veterinary Science for Agricultural Students, Farmers, and Stock-Keepers, remains an authoritative text book 120 years after its first publication (1895) and is available in paperback form today. It went into seven editions, and was translated and referred to by all sides in the Great War. ‘Greens’ encyclopaedia (the leading authority of the day), contained thirty-six articles appearing under his name.&lt;ref&gt;West Cumberland Times 21 July 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic responsibilities==
There were many examples of his civic work. He was a member of the Aspatria Urban District Council, the Wigton Board of Guardians; a Director of the West Cumberland Dairy Company, and the Aspatria Gas Works. He was president of the [[Aspatria RUFC]], a trustee of the Aspatria National Schools; a founder member of the Aspatria Volunteer Fire Brigade. He was also a collector of public subscriptions initiated to erect the districts first footpaths. He was secretary of the Aspatria Agricultural College, the Cumberland Steam Ploughing Society and the Aspatria Model Building Society. He was also a member of the Council of Veterinary Associations, and the secretary to the Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society, for over fifty years. He was also an authority on the [[Cumbrian dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;West Cumberland Times 21 July 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public recognition==
Harry Thompson preached the gospel of cooperation at every available opportunity and never tired of demonstrating its value to farmers. He succeeded in combating their apathy and their individuality, and worked for the society with a singleness and purpose that no monetary value ever did or could compensate. After the death of the ‘Grand Old Man of Cumberland Farming’ the following tribute appeared in the pages of the ‘Wheatsheaf’ magazine. 

::"There is no name more honourable in the records of agricultural co-operation than that of Henry Thompson of Aspatria Cumberland. Although a visionary surgeon and a leading authority on the pathology of animals for sixty years he found time not only to act as secretary of the Aspatria Agricultural Society, but also to champion the cause with his pen."

'''Hush money''' is a [[slang]] term for a form of [[bribery]]{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} in which one person or party offers another an attractive sum of money or other enticement, in exchange for remaining silent about some illegal, [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigmatic]], or [[shame]]ful behavior, action, or other fact about the person or party who has made the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investorwords.com/2363/hush_money.html|title=What is Hush Money? definition and meaning|website=InvestorWords.com|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively it can be money paid to placate a disgruntled adversary who may disclose embarrassing information, even if untrue. This is to save the intended person the harm and hassle of dealing with defamation.

The person or party who presents the hush money may be attempting to avoid [[prosecution|criminal prosecution]], a [[lawsuit]] (as sometimes in the case of an [[Settlement (litigation)|out-of-court settlement]]), a leak of information to the [[news media]], or silence about a stigmatic issue within one's own community. The information being covered up may include illegal activity, such as [[illegal drug trade|drug dealing]], or some personal secret, such as an [[extramarital affair]]. In some cases, a government agency may be involved in the offer of hush money in order to protect the agency's employees, politicians and their appointees, or a national government in its standing among other nations in the world. It is usually given under the table&lt;ref&gt;[https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/under+the+table The Free Dictionary by Farlex]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Hush money can refer to money paid for an agreement of confidentiality, which can be breached under court order.  It can also refer to an agreement to say a thing didn't happen that did happen, even in court testimony.   The latter type of agreement can be a criminal act itself as an [[obstruction of justice]].

==Origin==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] traces published use of the term to [[Richard Steele|Sir Richard Steele]] in 1709.

'''The International Science Festival in Gothenburg''' (Swedish: '''Vetenskapsfestivalen''') is an annual [[festival]] in [[Gothenburg]] with science activities.

== About the festival ==
The International Science Festival in Gothenburg took place for the first time in April 1997 and is since then an annual recurrent event.
The purpose is to communicate science to the public and schools in an easy accessible and in a thought provoking manner&lt;!--check translation--&gt;. Another objective is to create a positive attitude to [[research]] and [[science]] which is intended to encourage [[Education in Sweden#Higher education|higher education]].

About {{nowrap|100 000 visitors}} come each year.&lt;ref name=vgforsok&gt;[http://www.vartgoteborg.se/prod/sk/vargotnu.nsf/1/utbildning,varldsrekordforsok_inleder_goteborgs_tolfte_vetenskapsfestival vartgoteborg.se - Världsrekordförsök inleder Göteborgs tolfte vetenskapsfestival], Vårt Göteborg, 11 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the largest popular science event in [[Sweden]]&lt;ref name=festhome&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061101015134/http://www.goteborg.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=1601 goteborg.com - Festivalens hemsida] (archivelink 2006-11-01)&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest popular science events in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=fof08&gt;[http://www.fof.se/index.lasso?id=08364c Forskning och framsteg, 3/08 sid 64] (dead link 2012-04-24)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intimate media''' are [[recording medium|media]] artifacts created and collected by individuals, friends, and families to capture and commemorate aspects of [[family]] and intimate relationships. Intimate media includes such things as personal and family [[photo]] collections, home [[video]]s and [[film]]s, [[diary|diaries and journals]], and [[letter (message)|letter]]s. Depending on the meaning and values attributed to an object, anything could be considered intimate media.&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Great value is placed on intimate media possessions due to its ability to serve as "proof" that an event or memory actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print,p.220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intimate Media In Relation To Technology==
[[File:StateLibQld 2 171951 Intimate portrait of a man writing a letter, 1900-1910.jpg|thumb|Intimate portrait of a man writing a letter, 1900-1910 ([[State Library of Queensland]] courtesy)]]

"''Our memory and the stories we create, share, retell and live are a powerful way in which we determine and express who we are.''"&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p.219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their chapter of ''The New Everyday: Views on Ambient Intelligence'', entitled Intimate Media: Emotional Needs and Ambient Intelligence, John Cass, Lorna Goulden, and Slava Kozlov discuss the ways in which humans, as they "become familiar with the potential of new technologies in their workplaces...find ways to re-use what they have encountered there and find benefits in other parts of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; This process has led to the onset of digital and social media-based "intimate media," such as digital scrapbooks, email, text messaging, [[Pinterest]] pages, blogs, the "messages" portion of Facebook, online photo-sharing websites such as [[Flickr]], and websites like [[YouTube]]. Human memory and computer memory are quite different in terms of their accuracy and durability.&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; Storing intimate media on a computer mechanism helps to preserve the accuracy of the memory and lengthens its life as well. One potential problem with fusing intimate media and technology is that most technological intimate media is stored rather than displayed—it lives on hard drives, CDs, and the internet. The decorative nature of non-technological intimate media allows a person to imbue their living space with memories, triggers of happy moments, sentimental objects, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of technologies such as digital photo-frames, however, has begun to solve these technological deficiencies. This new virtual digital domain opens up a whole world of possibilities.
With intimate media now becoming increasingly digitalized, its potential for mobility, sharing, and copying is increasing drastically. Not only can a person transfer intimate media from one person or household to another, but the same intimate media can also be viewed simultaneously in a limitless number of locations. This opens up a new realm: [[ambient intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Aarts, E. H. L., and Stefano Marzano. The new everyday: views on ambient intelligence. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2003. Print, p.222&lt;/ref&gt; Now intimate media is no longer confined to bookshelves, mantles, closets, and coffee tables. It can travel with a person in her/his pocket, via cell phone or other digital device, wherever s/he goes.

'''Juan Roque''' was an African living in colonial [[Mexico City]]. He died in 1623, leaving behind one of very few wills and testaments of African residents of colonial Latin America.  His daughter Ana María, and the [[confraternity]] to which he belonged in the hospital of the ''Limpia Concepción'', also left behind documents describing a court battle which detail the final requests made by Juan Roque concerning a house “in the neighborhood of San Hipólito in the lane next to the College of San Juan where it meets the open air market of San Hipólito, bordering the houses of the marshals and those of Don Ángel de Villasaña.”&lt;ref name=McKnight89&gt;"Juan Roque's Donation," in Kathryn Joy McKnight, ''Afro-Latino Voices'', (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africans in New Spain ==
Africans played a notable role in the [[Spanish Conquest]]. As the Spanish and Portuguese control in colonial Latin America spread, Africans were stereotyped as slaves. However, there were exceptions.  Africans and [[mulattos]] played active roles in the early 16th century, acting as [[conquistadors]].  Juan Garrido, Juan García, and Juan Valiente were all successful conquistadors, who became part of the Spanish communities as the conquest was completed.

By the 17th century, Africans lived in colonial Latin America, with distinctive organizations and communities that blended African culture with the laws and social expectations of the Spaniards.  In New Spain, Africans, who originated from modern day coastal [[Sierra Leone]], founded a brotherhood in Mexico City,&lt;ref&gt;Mario Austin Nesvig, ed., Local Religion in Colonial Mexico, (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico, 2006), 219.&lt;/ref&gt;
which became the ''Zape'' Confraternity. Documents describe how Africans rose from slavery to become influential members of the community.

===The wealth and status of Juan Roque===
Brought to New Spain as a slave before 1600, Juan Roque left a comprehensive will and testament at his death. It reveals the importance of 'confraternities' to the African community in Mexico City, as well as the prominence some Africans were able to achieve. 

Written before his death in 1623, this last will and testament provided for a lavish and expensive funeral and lists profitable real estate that helped ensure the survival of the ''Zape'' Confraternity in Mexico City for several decades after his death.  Both expensive and Catholic, Juan Roque’s funeral provides evidence that Africans could establish themselves within communities in colonial Latin America.  He requested that he be buried either in the church of the Hospital of [[Our Lady of Immaculate Conception]] or the Santísma Veracruz Church of which he was a parishioner.  

In addition, Juan Roque asked that the brotherhoods to which he belonged, like the ''Zape'' Confraternity, accompany his body to the burial and that fifty-five Masses be sung for his soul at different churches around Mexico City, as well as twenty Masses sung for his deceased wife, Isabel de Herrera.&lt;ref name=McKnight87&gt;"Juan Roque's Donation," in Kathryn Joy McKnight, Afro-Latino Voices, (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), 87.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In her essay analyzing confraternities in New Spain, Nicole von Germeten points out that as a prominent and wealthy African in Mexico City, Juan Roque's lavish funeral “with all the trappings of baroque religiosity” and membership in a confraternity like that of the Zape nation demonstrates the respectability of men of African descent in colonial Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Austin Nesvig, ed., Local Religion in Colonial Mexico, (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico, 2006), 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  

He stated that his deceased wife was a free black woman, and when bequeathing his profitable real estate in the neighborhood of San Hipólito, Juan Roque pointed to the status of his daughter, Ana María, as a legitimate daughter from his marriage “according to the Most Holy Church” to Isabel de Herrera and therefore a free black woman.&lt;ref name=McKnight89/&gt; Designating  these Africans as free, gave them status within the community and helped the ''Zape'' Confraternity, as it made its case to regain the income from houses around San Hipólito, following Ana María dying childless.

==Confraternities==
Before her death, Ana María spoke to members of the ''Zape'' Confraternity confirming that her father had wished the brotherhood to receive the income from the real estate in San Hipólito.&lt;ref name=McKnight87/&gt;

In colonial Latin America, confraternities were organizations that allowed Africans to achieve a sense of community after being taken from their homeland through the slave trade. These brotherhoods also facilitated the Africans’ conversion to Catholicism: by providing a place of worship, a Christian community, and financial support for members' funerals.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haskett, “The Many Catholicisms of Colonial Mexico,” 216.&lt;/ref&gt;   The confraternities provided social welfare for Africans in New Spain and limited health care, when Africans were denied access to other assistance.

The importance of the confraternity’s ability to aid its members monetarily, is clearly evident In the court documents detailing the Zape Confraternity’s battle to receive the income of Juan Roque’s houses in San Hipólito. Juan Roque’s exact description of the location of the houses, in his last will and testament, attempted to ensure that his daughter. and eventually the confraternity, received the benefits of the properties.

===Ana Maria===
Several witnesses said that Ana María was adamant that her father wished the houses to go to the brotherhood, should she die without children.  Even when one of the elder members of the confraternity urged her to agree with her husband and sell the houses, Ana María refused, because her father “charged her that if she did not have children she should not dispose of the houses, but give them the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception (the ''Zape'' Confraternity), of which he was a member and founder, so that the blacks of the Zape nation would administer them and take care of their earnings.”&lt;ref&gt;“Juan Roque’s Donation,” in Kathryn Joy McKnight, Afro-Latino Voices, (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2471">'''Leave the gate as you found it''' (or '''leave all gates as found''') is an important rule of [[courtesy]] in rural areas throughout the world. If a [[gate]] is found open, it should be left open, and if it is closed, it should be left closed. If a closed gate absolutely must be traversed, it should be closed again afterwards. It applies to visitors travelling onto or across [[farm]]s, [[ranch]]es, and [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]].

In low-rainfall areas, closing gates can cut [[livestock]] off from water supplies. For example, most of the land used for grazing in [[Australia]] has no natural water supplies, so drinking water for the stock must be supplied by the farmer or landowner, often by using a [[windmill]] to pump [[groundwater]]. Even visitors who know how a stock water system works may be unaware of breakdowns. During hot weather, [[cattle]] require large quantities of water to drink and can die in less than a day if they don't get it. [[Sheep]] need less water and can survive longer without it, but will die if cut off from water for several hot days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myhorse.com/training/western/an_open_and_shut_gate_on_horseback.aspx#top |title=Open and Shut a Gate Horseback |publisher=MyHorse.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all agricultural areas, farmers need to keep groups of livestock separate, for reasons including [[Selective breeding|breeding]] for disease resistance and increased production, pest control, and controlling when ewes [[lambing|deliver their lambs]]. Unwanted mingling of flocks or herds can deprive a farmer of significant income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beginnercampingtips.com/articles/hiking-and-camping-uk.html |title=Camping Information |publisher=Beginnercampingtips.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original versions of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[The Country Code|Country Code]] advised visitors to always close gates. The revised Countryside Code now suggests that gates should be left as found.

Legal Tech companies are generally [[startup companies|startups]] founded with the purpose of [[disruptive innovation|disrupting]] the traditionally conservative legal market.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TechCrunch]], as of December 2014, "legal technology is booming, with companies attempting to disrupt the legal space at every level and from every angle"&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Legal Tech Startups Have A Short History And A Bright Future|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/06/legal-tech-startups-have-a-short-history-and-a-bright-future/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=TechCrunch|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forbes]] noted in February 2015 that there were “hundreds of legal startups popping up all over the US and Europe”.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Juetten|first1=Mary|title=The Future Of Legal Tech: It's Not As Scary As Lawyers Think|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjuetten/2015/02/19/legal-tech-or-tech-legal/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Legal technology traditionally referred to the application of technology and software to help law firms with [[legal matter management|practice management]], [[document management system|document storage]], [[invoicing|billing]], [[accounting]] and [[electronic discovery]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hibnick|first1=Eva|title=What is Legal Tech?|url=http://www.thelawinsider.com/insider-news/what-is-legal-tech|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=The Law Insider|date=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, Legal Tech has evolved to be associated more with technology startups disrupting the [[practice of law]] by giving people access to online software that reduces or in some cases eliminates the need to consult a lawyer, or by connecting people with lawyers more efficiently through online marketplaces and lawyer-matching websites.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt;

==Industry context==
The legal industry is widely seen to be conservative and traditional, with Law Technology Today noting that "in 50 years, the customer experience at most law firms has barely changed".&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  Reasons for this include the fact law firms face weaker cost-cutting incentives than other professions (since they pass disbursements directly to their client) and are seen to be risk averse (as a minor technological error could have significant financial consequences for a client).&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;

However, the growth of the hiring by businesses of in-house counsel and their increasing sophistication, together with the development of email, has led to clients placing increasing cost and time pressure on their lawyers.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  In addition, there are increasing incentives for lawyers to become technologically competent, with the [[American Bar Association]] voting in August 2012 to amend the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] to require lawyers to keep abreast of "the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Client-Lawyer Relationship, Rule 1.1 Competence - Comment|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/comment_on_rule_1_1.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrogi|first1=Robert|title=The Cloud Has Landed: 10 Legal Tech Innovations and What They Mean|url=http://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=88&amp;Issue=4&amp;ArticleID=23997|website=Wisconsin Lawyer|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the saturation of the market leading many lawyers to look for cutting-edge ways to compete.  &lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt; The exponential growth in the volume of documents (mostly email) that must be reviewed for litigation cases has greatly accelerated the adoption of technology used in eDiscovery, with elements of machine language and artificial intelligence being incorporated and cloud-based services being adopted by law firms.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Investment in Legal Tech is predominantly focused in the United States with more than $254 million invested in 2014 in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaltransformationinstitute.com/blog/2014/3/10/legal-startup-funding-2014-so-far |title=Legal Startup Funding &amp;#124; 2014 So Far [Update 10/24/14&amp;#93; — LTI |website=Legaltransformationinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there is significant growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Is The Legal Tech Boom Over?

[[Stanford Law School]] has started CodeX, the Center for Legal Informatics, an interdisciplinary research center, which also incubates companies started by law students and computer scientists. Some companies that have come out of the program include [[Lex Machina]] and [[Legal.io]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanford Law School |url=https://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics |title=CodeX - Programs and Centers - Stanford Law School |website=Law.stanford.edu |date=2016-11-27 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key areas==

* [[legal matter management|Practice management]]
* [[document management system|Document storage]]
* [[invoicing|Billing]]
* [[Accounting]]
* [[Electronic discovery]]
* [[Legal research]]

This is a '''list of currently active [[Separatism|separatist]] movements in [[North America]]'''. Separatism includes [[autonomism]] and [[secession]]ism. What is and is not considered an autonomist or secessionist movement is sometimes contentious. Entries on this list must meet three criteria:
# They are active movements with living, active members.
# They are seeking greater autonomy or self-determination for a geographic region.
# They are the citizen/peoples of the conflict area and do not come from other countries.

Under each region listed is one or more of the following:
* ''De facto'' state: for regions with ''[[de facto]]'' autonomy from the government
* Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding [[sovereign state]]
* Proposed autonomous area: for movements toward greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession
** ''De facto'' autonomous government: for governments with ''de facto'' autonomous control over a region
** Government-in-exile: for a [[Government in exile|government based outside of the region in question]], with or without control
** Political party (or parties): for [[Political party|political parties]] involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession
** Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations (sometimes called [[Terrorism|terrorist organisations]])
** Advocacy group(s): for [[Advocacy group|non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities]]
** [[Ethnic]]/[[ethno-religious]]/[[racial]]/[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]/[[Religious organization|religious]] group(s)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52393">This is a selected list of ''[[gairaigo]]'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words originating or based on [[foreign language]] (generally Western) terms, including ''[[wasei-eigo]]'' (Japanese [[pseudo-Anglicism]]s).

Many of these words derive from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], due to [[Portugal]]'s early role in Japanese-Western interaction; [[Dutch language|Dutch]], due to the [[Netherlands]]' relationship with [[Japan]] amidst the policy of ''[[sakoku]]'' during the [[Edo period]]; and from French and German, due to [[France]] and [[Germany]]'s cultural and scientific prominence during Japan's modernization in the [[Meiji period]].

However, most come from [[English language|English]], the dominant world language today. Due to the large number of western concepts imported into Japanese culture during modern times, there are thousands of these English borrowings.  These English words are informally referred to as having been "Nipponized". 

Japanese vocabulary also includes large numbers of words from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], borrowed at various points throughout history.  However, since the Japanese language has such strong historical ties to the Chinese language, these loans are not generally considered ''gairaigo''. 
Many loan words are in fact ''pseudo-borrowings'': despite their links to foreign language words, the word forms as used in modern Japanese are not used in the same way in their languages of origin. In fact, many such terms, despite their similarity to the original foreign words, are not easily understood by speakers of those languages (e.g. ''left over'' as a baseball term for a hit that goes over the left-fielder's head, rather than uneaten food saved for a later meal as in English—or ''famikon'' ファミコン from "Family computer", which actually refers to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]).

See the [[list of Japanese terms mistaken for gairaigo]] for details of words or terms mistaken for foreign loan words and [[false cognates]].

:''Note:''
:'''US''' = [[American English]]
:'''UK''' = [[British English]]

==Examples==
Due to the extent of Japanese borrowings, particularly from English, this list focuses mainly on pseudo-borrowings and commonly used loan words from languages other than English (which are often mistaken for English words in Japan). Most loan words (and all modern loans) are transcribed in [[Katakana]], a kana (Japanese syllabary) whose usage approximates English italics. Older loans may be written using [[Ateji]], with Kanji used to represent their phonetic readings without necessarily inheriting their meaning. In words composed of both a loan and native Japanese, the Japanese can function as a morpheme within a compound (and would generally be written in Kanji if possible), or can be attached to the foreign word to inflect or otherwise modify it, as if it were [[okurigana]] (which is written in Hiragana).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15095">'''Local history''' is the study of [[history]] in a geographically local context and it often concentrates on the [[local community]]. It incorporates [[cultural history|cultural]] and [[social history|social]] aspects of history. Local history is not merely national history writ small but a study of past events in a given geographical but one that is based on a wide variety of [[documentary evidence]] and placed in a [[Comparative contextual analysis|comparative context]] that is both regional and national.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Local History, 2nd ed.|last=Kammen|first=Carol|last2=Wilson|first2=Amy|publisher=AltaMira Press|year=2012|isbn=9780759120488|location=Lanham, MD|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic plaques are one form of documentation of significant occurrences in the past and [[Oral history|oral histories]] are another. 

Local history is often documented by local historical societies or groups that form to preserve a local historic building or other historic site. Many works of local history are compiled by amateur historians working independently or archivists employed by various organizations. An important aspect of local history is the publication and cataloguing of documents preserved in local or national records which relate to particular areas.

In a number of countries a broader concept of '''local lore''' is known, which is a comprehensive study of everything pertaining to a certain locality: history, ethnography, geography, natural history, etc. 

==Local contexts==
Local history tends to be less documented than other types, with fewer books and artifacts than that of a country or continent. Many local histories are recorded as oral tales or stories and so are more vulnerable than more well known issues. Artifacts of local history are often collected in local history museums, which may be housed in a historic house or other building. Individual historic sites are inherently local, although they may have national or world history importance as well. Many however have little overall historical impact but add depth to the local area.

===Australia===

In Australia, local history is focussed on specific cities and suburbs or country towns and regions. In cities, local history might concentrate on a [[Central business district|CBD]] and its bordering suburbs, on a specific suburb or [[Local government in Australia|municipality]], or on an agglomeration of suburbs and municipalities (because local government boundaries have changed over time). Outside the larger cities, local history often examines regional towns and surrounding areas.

Records are typically stored at state libraries, municipal libraries, historical societies and public record offices. For example, the [[State Library of Victoria]] holds extensive local history records for [[Melbourne]] and other places in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Many other [[List of libraries in Melbourne|Melbourne libraries]] have local history collections, along with the [[Public Record Office Victoria]] and the [[Royal Historical Society of Victoria]]. In [[New South Wales]], the [[Royal Australian Historical Society]] has studied local history as part of its remit since its founding in 1901. It holds local history records along with the [[State Library of NSW]] and other state and local libraries and archives.

Historians have examined the ways local history has been written in Australia since the nineteenth century. Early on, the emphasis was on pioneer and settler history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirst |first=John |date=1978 |title=The pioneer legend |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10314617808595595 |journal=Historical Studies |volume=18 |issue=71 |pages=316–337 |doi=10.1080/10314617808595595 |access-date=2017-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creative ways that local history contributed to making community has also been argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Tom |date=1996 |title=Hunters and Collectors: The Antiquarian Imagination in Australia |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521483492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, local history, [[urban history]], [[public history]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] were closely connected in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davison |first=Graeme |date=2000 |title=The use and abuse of Australian history |location=St. Leonards, N.S.W |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn=1864487208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|English local history|British Association for Local History}}
The [[British Association for Local History]] in the United Kingdom encourages and assists in the study of local history as an academic discipline and as a leisure activity by both individuals and groups. Most historic counties in England have record societies and archaeological and historical societies which coordinate the work of historians and other researchers concerned with that area.

Local history in the UK took a long time to be accepted as an academic discipline. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was widely regarded as an [[antiquarian]] pursuit, suitable for country parsons. The [[Victoria County History|Victoria History of the Counties of England]] project begun in 1899 in honour of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the [[historic counties of England]]. The project is coordinated by the [[Institute of Historical Research]] at the [[University of London]]. The first academic post related to local history was at [[Reading University]] which appointed a research fellow in local history in 1908. There was a department of local history (but without a professor) at [[Leicester University]] from 1947. [[H. P. R. Finberg]] was the first Professor of English Local History. He was appointed by Leicester in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|pages=46–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local history continues to be neglected as an academic subject within universities. Academic local historians are often found within a more general department of history or in continuing education.

Local history is rarely taught as a separate subject in British schools. In 1908, a Board of Education circular had urged that schools should pay attention "to the history of the town and district" in which they were situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the Ministry of Education suggested schools should use local material to illustrate national themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the current [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], pupils at level 4 are expected to "show their knowledge and understanding of local, national and international history".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100418051729/http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/key-stage-3/history/Level-descriptions/index.aspx National Curriculum - level descriptions]&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The [[Alan Ball Local History Awards]] were established in the 1980s to recognize outstanding contributions in local history publishing in the UK (both in print and in [[new media]]), and to encourage the publishing of such works by [[public library|public libraries]] and [[local authority#United Kingdom|local authorities]].&lt;ref name=clip2010&gt;[http://www.cilip.org.uk/get-involved/special-interest-groups/local-studies/activities/pages/alanball.aspx Local Studies Alan Ball Local History Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506050104/http://www.cilip.org.uk/get-involved/special-interest-groups/local-studies/activities/pages/alanball.aspx |date=2011-05-06 }} [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]], published 2011-11-02, accessed 2012-05-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Local history can become a crucial component to policy-making and serve as a marketable resource and this is demonstrated in the case of [[Northern Ireland]]. Aside from its contribution to local development, local history is being used as a non-contentious meeting ground in addressing conflicting traditions by reinforcing shared past rather than adversarial political history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Family and Local History|last=Hey|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780191044939|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|American urban history}}
In the United States, local history is usually concentrated on any history of the place and people from a particular [[village]] or [[township]]. Several villages and townships would comprise one county or county history. Library records are often divided by State, then county, then township/local history. The American Local History Network (ALHN) in the United States provides a focus for accessing independent genealogical and historical resources.

In the United States, 79,000 historic sites are identified as listings on its [[National Register of Historic Places]]. State and local municipalities often have additional landmark designations to cover sites of more purely local interest.

In addition, many regional and state [[historical societies]] maintain regional history and actively seek out missing historical collections.

A new form of local history is the movement of "[[If This House Could Talk]]" projects in various urban neighborhoods in the United States. These small scale locally generated history events encourage an interest in history and provide for open ended participation by the general public. However, there is often no vetting or third party review of the factual evidence that is presented, and therefore such presentations may require oversight by professional third party history organizations if they are to be transcribed into ongoing collections of local history.

=== Slavic countries ===

In several Slavic countries there is a related study which may be translated from the local languages as "country lore" or "local lore". In addition to history, it also incorporates other local studies, such as local geography, nature, and ethnography.

In the USSR, Russia and Russian-speaking post-Soviet states local lore is known as ''krayevedenie'' ([[:ru:Краеведение|Краеведение]]). It is taught in primary schools. There are also local lore museums known as ''krayevedcheskie muzei''. In modern Russia the concept of "regional studies" ( Регионоведение) is also considered.&lt;ref&gt;Ю. Н. Гладкий, А. И. Чистобаев. ''Регионоведение. Учебник для студентов высших учебных заведений'' (''Regional Studies. A Texbook for Higher Education Students'') Moscow, Гардарики, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ukraine]], the study of local history and regional ethnography is known as ''krayeznavstvo'' ({{lang-uk|[[:uk:краєзнавство|краєзнавство]]}}. The National Union of Local Lore Researchers of Ukraine is a professional society for researchers of ethnology and local studies in Ukraine. It was founded in 1925 and has 3,000 members in 17 chapters.&lt;ref name="nsku"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nsku.org.ua/?page_id=5606 | title=Історія Національної спілки краєзнавців України | publisher=National Union of Local Lore Researchers of Ukraine | accessdate=20 January 2015 | language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society has published its journal ''Краєзнавство'' since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Краєзнавство'' | url=http://nsku.org.ua/?page_id=5603 | accessdate=20 January 2015 | language=Ukrainian }} Individual issues of the journal are available from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Krajeznavstvo Wikimedia Commons]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Poland]], the corresponding concept is called ''[[:pl:Krajoznawstwo|krajoznawstwo]]'', the term known since 1902. In modern Poland various organized ''krajoznawstwo'' activities are carried out by [[PTTK|Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczno-Krajoznawcze]], ineptly translated as "Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society".

'''Louisa Morton Greene''' (née Louisa Morton Willard; May 23, 1819 - March 5, 1900) was a 19th-century American reformer, writer, abolitionist, suffragist, women's rights worker, temperance worker, and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] relief worker,{{sfn|Herman|Tal|1984|p=121}} from [[Massachusetts]]. Though she had limited schooling, she was the first American woman to rebel against discrimination towards women in industry, refusing to accept a woman's pay rate after doing a man's job.{{sfn|Fisher|Laschever|1966|p=151}} Greene was also an early champion of the temperance and suffrage causes in her writing and speaking engagements. She died in 1900.

==Early years and education==
Louisa Morton Willard was born in [[Ashburnham, Massachusetts]], May 23, 1819. She is a descendant from sturdy New England ancestors. Her father, Henry Willard. blacksmith and farmer, removed from Vermont and settled in Ashburnham in the early years of the present century. Bereft of both parents in early childhood, she was deprived of schooling and thrown upon her own resources at the age of 13.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=338-39}} 

==Career==
She obtained employment in a woolen factory in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]], and worked for several years for the pittance of US$1.00 to $2.00 per week and board, working 14 hours a day. There, upon the heads of bobbins, she learned to write. Notwithstanding her long hours of labor, she found time for constant improvement by reading and study. Her habits of strict economy enabled her to save a portion of her wages, and at the age of 17 she had $150.00 in the bank. Then came her first revolt against the injustice shown to women in industrial pursuits. Gross discrimination in the matter of wages was made, simply on the ground of sex. Called upon at one time to take a man's place at a spindle, she performed her duties well and to the satisfaction of her employer. When pay-day came around and she demanded the same compensation that the man had been securing, her request was received with amazement. The plucky young girl stood her ground and refused to return to the spindle unless paid at the same rate as the man whose place she was filling. She was promptly dismissed from the factory, to be recalled a few weeks later at a higher rate of pay.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=338-39}} 

In 1840, she taught school near [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. There, she formed the acquaintance of Jonas Greene, of [[Maine]], and they married in 1841. Mr. Greene subsequently became a prominent politician, representing his district in each branch of the State legislature for several successive terms. His success in life he ascribed largely to the cooperation and support of his wife. Removing with her husband to the then somewhat sparsely settled [[Oxford County, Maine]], a new and active life opened for her. While performing faithfully her duties, she found time to enter into the philanthropic and reform work of the times. Early becoming a convert to the [[Water cure (therapy)|Water cure]] system of treating the sick, she familiarized herself with it and soon developed a remarkable ability for the care and treatment of the sick. Physicians and medicines were unknown in her household, and her skill was in demand in the community.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=338-39}}  

In 1850, Greene began to espouse the anti-slavery cause. She and others gathered women together and organized anti-slavery societies. Literature was distributed, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' was read, and she wrote many articles for the local papers. During the [[American Civil War]], Greene's patriotic labors were untiring. When hospital supplies were needed, she collected, prepared and forwarded them. Greene's newspaper contributions for years covered a wide range of subjects. She was an early champion of the temperance and suffrage causes in her writing and speaking engagements. In 1869, she removed with her family to [[Manassas, Virginia]], where her husband died in 1873. With advancing years, Greene withdrew from active philanthropic work.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=338-39}} She died March 5, 1900.&lt;ref name="findagrave.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisa Morton Willard Greene (1819 - 1900) - Find A Grave Memorial|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=68311615|website=findagrave.com|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication
medium evaluation and selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.
[[File:Interactive.png|thumb|left|alt=An Interactive Model of Communication.|The Interactive Model.]]
*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

As opposed to a simple [[institutional repository]] or [[disciplinary repository]], open-access repositories provide free access to research for users outside the institutional community and are one of the recommended ways to achieve the [[open access]] vision described in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] definition of open access. This is sometimes referred to as the [[self-archiving]] or "green" route to open access.

== Benefits ==
The benefits of open-access repositories, as opposed to conventional digital [[institutional repositories]], are:
* Opening up outputs of the institution to a worldwide audience;
* Maximizing the visibility and impact of these outputs as a result;
* Showcasing the institution to interested constituencies – prospective staff, prospective students and other stakeholders;
* Collecting and curating digital output;
* Managing and measuring research and teaching activities;
* Providing a workspace for work-in-progress, and for collaborative or large-scale projects;
* Enabling and encouraging interdisciplinary approaches to research;
* Facilitating the development and sharing of digital teaching materials and aids, and
* Supporting student endeavours, providing access to theses and dissertations and a location for the development of e-portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swan|first=Alma|title=Open Access institutional repositories: A Briefing Paper (2009)|url=http://www.openscholarship.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2009-01/open_access_institutional_repositories.pdf|work=Open Scholarship|access-date=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Potted History: The Story of Plants in the Home ''''' is a 2007 book on social history and horticulture and gardening in the historical domestic setting by author and journalist [[Catherine Horwood]]. It was first published in hardback by the British publisher [[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VcUkvgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Catherine+Horwood%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE39nH3-XeAhXEkywKHfRjBJcQ6AEIOjAD Google Books: Potted History]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Editions==
''Potted History: The Story of Plants in the Home'' was published in an illustrated, hardback edition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VcUkvgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Catherine+Horwood%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE39nH3-XeAhXEkywKHfRjBJcQ6AEIOjAD Google Books: Potted History: Editions: details]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Rather than focusing on the more usual subject matter of how to look after and rear houseplants, Horwood instead traces the historical and sociological reasons why houseplants but Catherine Horwood came to be found in our homes. She writes how potted plants and domestic horticulture are as subject to fashion as pieces of furniture, from the Victorian's use of the aspidistra in their front parlour to the contemporary of the orchid in the designer loft. The book also covers the influence of indoor horticulture on period design, finding that [[Wedgwood]] created a market for special bulb pots and that some of [[Terence Conran]]'s early designs were for houseplant containers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2251425.Potted_History Good read: Potted History: Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21144">'''Problematic integration theory''' is a [[Outline of communication|theory of communication]] that addresses the processes and dynamics of how people receive, evaluate, and respond to information and experiences. The premises of PI are based on the view that message processing, specifically the development of probabilistic and evaluative orientations (our perceptions of something's likelihood of occurring and its value, respectively), is a social and cultural construction. In situations where there is agreement between probabilistic orientation (a person's constructed belief about an object's likelihood, i.e., how likely something is to occur) and evaluative orientation (a person's constructed belief about an object's value), integration is in harmony, i.e., not problematic. However, when there is disagreement between these orientations about an object (i.e., an event, thing, person, idea, outcome, etc.), then integration becomes problematic. This disharmony leads to conflict and discomfort, which can manifest itself as cognitive, communicative, affective, and/or motivational.

== History ==
Austin Babrow&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014234303/http://coms.ohiou.edu/austin-babrow Austin Babrow, Ph.D.], Ohio University (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced the theory of Problematic Integration (PI) in 1992.  Babrow brought together a diverse and interdisciplinary literature (from the field of communication and related disciplines, like psychology, sociology, and philosophy) to serve as building blocks for his new theory.  Among the theoretical underpinnings that support PI are:  [[uncertainty reduction theory]]; the theory of belief in a just world; analysis of decision-making; the theory of and motivation and self-esteem; and [[cognitive dissonance]]. However, despite integrating elements from these theories, PI has striking differences (e.g., unlike URT, PI does not assume that uncertainty is an undesirable situation, nor does it suggest that resolution of uncertainty is always necessary or desirable).&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 456-476.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

Problematic Integration is a type of message-processing communication theory that relates to theories of decision making and persuasion.  Problematic Integration Theory (PI) proposes that: (1) people orient themselves to the world by forming both probabilistic and evaluative orientations; (2) that probability and evaluation are not independent from one another; (3) that probability and evaluation are socially based and socially constructed, and that probability and evaluation are integral to our daily experience; and, (4) that integration of these orientations can be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 555.&lt;/ref&gt;  Probabilistic orientation is an assessment of the likelihood of an event or outcome.  Evaluative orientation is an assessment of the favorability of an outcome. Often, assessments of probability and value are cooperative and easily integrated. However, as the theory's title implies, there are occasions when integration becomes problematic. PI proposes that integration becomes more difficult as:
# clarity of object probability decreases
# object value conflicts increase
# or, there is an increase in the divergence between object expectation and desire&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''[[Communication Monographs]]'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, problematic integration is what we experience when our probabilistic and evaluative orientations conflict with one another, causing instability and disharmony.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conflict arising from problematic integration may or may not be significant.  The more important a value and the more central an issue (or object, to use PI terminology) is to one's beliefs or cultural values, the more likely that problematic integration will cause greater discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 287-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assumptions of problematic integration theory===

Babrow identified four distinct manifestations, or forms, of problematic integration:
# Divergence
# Ambiguity
# Ambivalence
# Impossibility

The first of these integrative predicaments, divergence, arises when there is a discrepancy between what we believe to be true or to be likely to occur and what we want to be true (the desired outcome). Ambiguity arises when the probability or value of an object (i.e., situation, outcome, thing, etc.) is unclear or highly uncertain. Babrow explained, that “in ambiguous situations, neither the outcome, nor the probability of the outcome is known, though the latter has restrictions” (Babrow, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;112).  Uncertainty occurs when an unknown factor obscures or complicates the development of one's orientation (probability and evaluation) toward an outcome.   Ambiguity has also been described as uncertainty about what is unknown.  Ambivalence is borne from one of two conditions: (1) an individual is forced to choose between two similarly valued alternatives; or (2) an individual is forced to choose between mutually exclusive alternatives. The last form of PI, impossibility, occurs upon the realization or belief that an outcome is will not happen. Impossibility is recognized as different from a form of divergence, because only impossibility denotes a sense of certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, Communication Monographs, 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 285-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Responses to impossibility can range from a sense of futility, to one of increased motivation to deny the impossibility. All of these situations give rise to conflict.

===The role of communication in problematic integration theory===

Communication is both a source of, a medium, and a method for resolving conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;  Communication is a source of problematic integration in that knowledge and evaluative orientations are the result of communication, probabilistic and evaluative orientations are based on and developed through message and [[meaning-making]] (forms of communication), and communication is itself "an object of thought" and is therefore  an object "of probabilistic and evaluative orientations."&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that a person experiencing problematic integration will seek new information or new sources of information to bolster or reinforce a desired probabilistic or evaluative orientation.  This could also be seen engaging in as a form of [[cognitive dissonance]].  Communication is seen as a medium of problematic integration because communication inherently involves or is based on probabilistic and evaluative orientations, or communication is about probability and value.  Communication is influenced by and formed from culture; thus, communication is a medium of PI, as and the formation of probabilistic and evaluative orientations derives from cultural frameworks.  Lastly, communication is a resource for PI as we try to resolve and manage conflict caused by problematic integration through communication (internal, interpersonal, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because communication may be a source, medium, and/or method for resolving problematic integration, it is possible for conflict to manifest as "extended chains" of problematic integration.  Such extended chains occur through forms, foci, and layers of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 461-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  By extended chains, it is meant that experiences of problematic integration and efforts to resolve problematic integration may lead to development of a new form of PI.  As conflict between probability and value develops around a focal point (or topic), it can lead to conflict regarding a new topic (e.g., stress and anxiety about earning an end-of-year bonus at work can lead to new worries about personal finances, sense of self-worth, and/or one's status and career prospects at work).  Problematic integration becomes shared (or chained) through layers of experience when people discuss and relate their struggles with others.  In this process of communicating our conflicts, others may share in our problematic integration through empathy and sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  Babrow proposed that communication becomes more important to resolve problematic integration as the conflict or integration becomes more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique and analysis===

As mentioned above, Problematic Integration Theory is a type of communication theory that examines how we make meaning of information and experiences, and how we handle uncertainty.  PI differs from [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]] and other axiomatic and predictive communication theories in a number of ways.  PI proposes that there are numerous and varied meanings of the term uncertainty.  Unlike URT, PI predicts that experiencing uncertainty does not automatically lead to a desire to reduce the uncertainty.  Further, PI proposes that: (1) uncertainty is not always "bad; (2) uncertainty has a single or narrow meaning; (3) reduction of uncertainty is not always possible; (4) any resolution of uncertainty is not necessarily final; and, (5) integrative dilemmas do not necessarily have an identifiable or singular cause.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 562-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problematic Integration Theory (PI) falls under the socio-psychological and socio-cultural communication traditions. PI began with a focus on intra- and inter-personal contexts, but has been applicable in many contexts, including interpersonal, small group, and organizational; thus, it has a broad scope of application.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, Journal of Communication, September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;  PI is considered an interpretive/hermeneutic approach of theory rather than positivistic/empirical (i.e., predictive) or critical.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related work: uncertainty management theory===

Babrow's theory shares some common ideas with Uncertainty Management Theory (UMT), which was developed by Dale Brashers (2007, A theory of communication and uncertainty management. In B. Whaley &amp; W. Samter (Eds.), Explaining communication theory (pp.&amp;nbsp;201–218). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum). For a comparison of the perspectives, see Bradac (2001).&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 463-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current usage ==

The complexity of PI and the multiplicity of its manifestations makes it difficult to operationalize, measure, and apply.  However, this breadth of scope also indicates that it may have extremely wide-ranging applications and opportunities for research.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the concepts within PI are based on cultural definitions, PI is seen as being overly responsive to external conceptual influences; thus, making it potentially falsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

PI has been used within the realm of [[Health Communication]] studies in order to assess methods of educating, and communicating with, patients facing a variety chronic or life-threatening conditions. In 2003, Babrow received the prestigious Woolbert Award for scholarship of exceptional originality and influence from the National Communication Association [http://www.natcom.org/nca/Template2.asp?sid=9] for his work with PI.

PI has been used extensively in analysis of the health care system, particularly in regard to communication between health care providers and patients.  The health-care system inherently involves communication between health-care providers (e.g., doctors, nurses, various therapists, dietitians, social workers, counselors, etc.), patients, and members of the patient's social and support network (e.g., family members, friends, members of support groups, etc.).  Because understanding and communicating diagnoses, prognoses, treatment plans, expectations, and more can be complicated and because this communication relies on the communication skills of the various people involved, health-care situations offer ample opportunity to examine problematic integration.  Research in this area has revealed that information is used to decrease and increase uncertainty, depending on the situation.  In some cases, patients may seek information to reduce stressful uncertainty.  However, in other cases, the care team and the patient may need to increase uncertainty in order to increase optimism and allow for re-evaluation of a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Brashers, Dale E., Daena J. Goldsmith, and Elaine Hsieh; “Information Seeking and Avoiding in Health Contexts”, ''Human Communication Research'', 2002, Vol. 28, No. 2, pp. 261-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  PI has been used to study communication involving various medical issues, including breast cancer,&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Michael Robert, Adrianne Kunkel, and Joann Keyton; “Problematic Integration Theory, Appraisal Theory, and the Bosom Buddies Breast Cancer Support Group”, Journal of Applied Communication Research, Ed. 36, pp. 415-436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Leigh A., Austin S. Babrow, and Cynthia Stohl; “Social Support Messages and the Management of Uncertainty in the Experience of Breast Cancer: An Application of Problematic Integration Theory”, Communication Monographs, 1996, Vol. 63, pp. 189-207.&lt;/ref&gt; the treatment of diabetes in the elderly, end-of-life issues, and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias, Marianne Sassi and Austin S. Babrow; “Problematic Integration of Uncertainty and Desire in Pregnancy”, Qualitative Health Research, 2007, Vol. 17, pp. 786-798.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthias, Marianne Sassi; “Problematic Integration in Pregnancy and Childbirth: Contrasting Approaches to Uncertainty and Desire in Obstetric and Midwifery Care”, Health Communication, 2009, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problematic Integration has also been used to evaluate [[organizational communication]].  Organizations, comprising networks and hierarchies of individuals, by their very nature, create complex webs of various dynamic social and cultural relationships.  Moreover, most organizations do not exist for themselves, but for an external audience, client, or consumer; thereby, increasing the nature, types, and numbers of relationships.  Communication within these relationships will very likely give rise to instances of uncertainty.  In the context of such complex systems of communication, PI takes on a much different appearance than intrapersonal situations.  An organization's structure, system design, and strategy can create, maintain, or help reduce problematic integration.&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Robert D. and Pamela Zaug, “Organizational Theory, Organizational Communication, Organizational Knowledge, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 578-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of this study has been problematic integration arising from [[Constitutive role of communication in organizations|internal bureaucracy or organizational rules or objectives]] and how this conflict involves matters of formal rationality (a quantitative calculation of an action or choice) or substantive rationality (a value judgment of consequences of an action or choice).&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Robert D. and Pamela Zaug, “Organizational Theory, Organizational Communication, Organizational Knowledge, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 575-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In examining marketing strategies for tourism, PI has been used to suggest methods for decreasing uncertainty for potential customers and thereby increasing transactions from the on-line shoppers for the related retail businesses ("converting lookers to bookers").&lt;ref&gt;Han, Jee-Hee and Juline E. Mills, “The Use of Problematic Integration Theory to Assess Destination On-Line Promotion Activities: The Case of Australia.com in the United States Market”, ''Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing'', 2006, Vol. 20 (3/4), pp. 93-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, PI lends itself to application to a broad scope of issues.  A few other examples of areas of interest to which PI has been applied include:
* [[Risk management tools|Risk study and evaluation]]&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Laura and Austin Babrow; “Risk in the Making: Narrative, Problematic Integration, and the Social Construction of Risk”, Communications Theory, 2011, pp. 239-260.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Family and relationships
* [[Narrative communication]]
* [[Mass media]] and [[media Studies]] (e.g., news reporting)
* Marketing and advertising

A '''public aquarium''' (plural: ''public aquaria'' or '' public aquariums'') is the aquatic counterpart of a [[zoo]], which houses living [[aquatic animal]] and [[aquatic plant|plant]] specimens for public viewing. Most public [[aquarium]]s feature tanks larger than those kept by home aquarists, as well as smaller tanks. Since the first public aquariums were built in the mid-19th century, they have become popular and their numbers have increased. Most modern accredited aquariums stress conservation issues and educating the public.&lt;ref name="azacon"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061205213201/http://www.aza.org/Newsroom/PR_VisitorImpact/ Visitor Impact], [http://www.aza.org/ AZA official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hyogo ikesu.jpg|thumbnail|An early aquarium in Japan in the 18th century]]
The first public [[aquarium]] was opened in [[London Zoo]] in May 1853; the ''Fish House'', as it came to be known, was constructed much like a [[greenhouse]].&lt;ref name=Brunner&gt;{{cite book | last = Brunner | first = Bernd | title = The Ocean at Home | publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | year = 2003 | location = New York | isbn = 1-56898-502-9 | pages = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P.T. Barnum]] quickly followed in 1856 with the first American aquarium as part of his established [[Barnum's American Museum]], which was located on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[New York City]] before it burned down.&lt;ref name=Brunner/&gt; In 1859, the [[Boston Aquarial Gardens|Aquarial Gardens]] were founded in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=Brunner/&gt; A number of aquariums then opened in Europe, such as the [[Jardin d'Acclimatation]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Vienna|Viennese]] Aquarium Salon (both founded 1860), the Marine Aquarium Temple as part of the [[Zoological Garden of Hamburg|Zoological Garden]] in [[Hamburg]] (1864), as well as aquariums in [[Berlin]] (1869) and [[Brighton]] (1872).&lt;ref name=Brunner/&gt;

The old Berlin Aquarium opened in 1869.
The building site was to be ''Unter den Linden'' (along a major avenue), in the centre of town, not at the [[Berlin Zoological Garden|Berlin Zoo]].
The aquarium's first director, [[Alfred Brehm]], former director of the [[Zoological Garden of Hamburg|Hamburg Zoo]] from 1863 to 1866, served until 1874.&lt;ref name=Hoage69&gt;Strehlow, Harro, "Zoos and Aquariums of Berlin" in ''New World, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century'', Hoage, Robert J. and Deiss, William A. (ed.), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, p.69. {{ISBN|0-8018-5110-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With its emphasis on [[education]], the public aquarium was designed like a grotto, part of it made of natural rock. The ''Geologische Grotte'' depicted "the strata of the [[earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]]". The grotto also featured [[bird]]s and pools for [[earless seal|seal]]s.
The Aquarium ''Unter den Linden'' was a three-story building. Machinery and water tanks were on the ground floor, [[aquarium]] basins for the [[fish]] on the first floor. Because of Brehm's special interest in [[bird]]s, a huge [[aviary]], with [[cage (enclosure)|cage]]s for [[mammal]]s placed around it, was located on the second floor.
The facility closed in 1910.&lt;ref name=Hoage70&gt;Strehlow, Harro, "Zoos and Aquariums of Berlin" in ''New World, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century'', Hoage, Robert J. and Deiss, William A. (ed.), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, p.70. {{ISBN|0-8018-5110-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Artis aquarium at [[Natura Artis Magistra|Amsterdam Zoo]] was constructed inside a Victorian building in 1882, and was renovated in 1997.
At the end of the 19th century the Artis aquarium was considered state-of-the-art, as it was again at the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Van Bruggen, A.C., "Notes on the Buildings of Amsterdam Zoo", [http://www.zoonews.ws/IZN/319/IZN-319.htm#amst International Zoo News Vol.49/6 (No.319)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411023210/http://www.zoonews.ws/IZN/319/IZN-319.htm#amst |date=2008-04-11 }}, September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its closing on September 30, 2013, the oldest American aquarium was the [[National Aquarium in Washington, D.C.]], founded in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;David Lin, former Director of Operations, National Aquarium, Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the opening of other public aquariums: San Francisco ([[Woodward's Gardens]], 1873–1890), [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]] ([[Woods Hole Science Aquarium]], 1885), New York ([[New York Aquarium]], 1896–present), La Jolla ([[Birch Aquarium|Scripps]], 1903), Honolulu ([[Waikiki Aquarium]], 1904–present), Detroit ([[Belle Isle Aquarium]], 1904–2005, 2012–Present), Philadelphia ([[Philadelphia Aquarium]], 1911–1962), San Francisco ([[Steinhart Aquarium]], 1923), Chicago ([[Shedd Aquarium]], 1929). For many years, the Shedd Aquarium was the largest aquarium in the United States until the [[Georgia Aquarium]] in [[Atlanta]] opened 2005. 
Entertainment and aquatic circus exhibits were combined as themes in Philadelphia's [[Aquarama Aquarium Theater of the Sea]] (1962–1969) and Camden's re-invented [[Adventure Aquarium]] 2005, formerly the [[New Jersey State Aquarium]] (1992).

The first Japanese public aquarium, a small freshwater aquarium, was opened at the [[Ueno Zoo]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=Kisling298&gt;Kawata, Ken, "Zoological Gardens of Japan", in ''Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Collections to Zoological Gardens'', Kisling, Vernon N. (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2001, p.298. {{ISBN|0-8493-2100-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Georgia Aquarium, with more than 8 million U.S. gallons (6.7 million imp gal; 30 million L) of marine and fresh water, and more than 100,000 animals of 500 different species opened in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The aquarium's notable specimens include [[whale sharks]] and [[beluga whales]].

==Public aquariums today==
[[Image:Male whale shark at Georgia Aquarium.jpg|thumb|A male [[whale shark]] in [[Georgia Aquarium]]'s largest aquarium]]
Modern aquarium tanks can hold millions of litres of water and can house large species, including [[dolphin]]s, [[shark]]s or [[Beluga (whale)|beluga]] whales. This is accomplished through thick, clear [[acrylic glass]] windows. Aquatic and semiaquatic mammals, including [[otter]]s,&lt;ref name = "Otter"&gt;[http://www.aquarium.org/exhibitsSeaOtters.asp?sid=2 Sea Otters], [http://www.aquarium.org/  Oregon Coast Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[pinniped|seals]]&lt;ref name = "Seal"&gt;[http://www.aquarium.org/exhibitsSeals.asp?sid=2 Seals], [http://www.aquarium.org/  Oregon Coast Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; are often cared for at aquariums. Some establishments, such as the [[Oregon Coast Aquarium]] or the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]], have aquatic [[aviary|aviaries]].&lt;ref name = "Birds"&gt;[http://www.aquarium.org/exhibitsBirds.asp?sid=2 Birds], [http://www.aquarium.org/  Oregon Coast Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandy Shores"&gt;[http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/sandy.asp Sandy Shores] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212155628/http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/sandy.asp |date=2009-02-12 }}, [http://www.mbayaq.org/  Monterey Bay Aquarium's official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214235655/http://www.mbayaq.org/ |date=2009-02-14 }}, accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern aquariums also include land animals and plants that spend time in or near the water.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Leighton R., ''Aquariums: Windows to Nature'', Prentice Hall General Reference, New York, 1993. {{ISBN|0-671-85019-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For marketing purposes, many aquariums promote special exhibits, in addition to their permanent collections. Some have aquatic versions of a [[petting zoo]]. The [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] has a shallow tank filled with common types of [[batoidea|rays]]&lt;ref name="Sharks and Rays"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020056/http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/smm_meet.asp Sharks and Rays], [http://www.mbayaq.org/  Monterey Bay Aquarium's official website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214235655/http://www.mbayaq.org/ |date=2009-02-14 }}, accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which visitors are encouraged to touch.  The [[South Carolina Aquarium]] lets visitors feed the rays in their Saltmarsh Aviary exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Most public aquariums are located close to the [[ocean]], for a steady supply of natural seawater. An inland pioneer was [[Chicago|Chicago's]] [[Shedd Aquarium]]&lt;ref name="Shedd History 1"&gt;[http://www.sheddaquarium.org/history.html Shedd History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515082202/http://www.sheddaquarium.org/history.html |date=2008-05-15 }}, [http://www.sheddaquarium.org/  Shedd Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; that received seawater shipped by rail in special tank cars. The early (1911) [[Philadelphia Aquarium]], built in the city's disused [[Fairmount Water Works|water works]], had to switch to treated city water when the nearby river became too contaminated.&lt;ref name = "Shedd History 2"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/phso/rtca2001/news_waterworks.htm], [http://www.nps.gov/  Philadelphia Inquirer article], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the recently opened [[Georgia Aquarium]] filled its tanks with fresh water from the city water system and salinated its salt water exhibits using the same commercial salt and mineral additives available to home aquarists. The [[South Carolina Aquarium]] pulls the salt water for their exhibits right out of the Charleston harbor.

In January 1985, Kelly Tarlton began construction of the first aquarium to include a large transparent [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] tunnel, [[Kelly Tarlton's Sea Life Aquarium|Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. Construction took 10 months and cost NZ$3 million. The {{convert|110|m|ft|adj=on}} tunnel was built from one-[[tonne]] (2,200-lb) slabs of German sheet plastic that were shaped locally in an oven. A moving walkway now transports visitors through, and groups of school children occasionally hold sleepovers there beneath the swimming sharks and rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viewauckland.co.nz/kelly_tarltons_antarctic_encounter_underwater_world_auckland_index.html Kelly Tarlton's Antarctic Encounter and Underwater World, Auckland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503111959/http://www.viewauckland.co.nz/kelly_tarltons_antarctic_encounter_underwater_world_auckland_index.html |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Public aquariums are often affiliated with oceanographic research institutions or conduct their own research programs, and sometimes specialize in species and ecosystems that can be found in local waters. For example, the [[Vancouver Aquarium]] in [[Vancouver, BC]] is a major center for marine research, conservation, and marine animal rehabilitation, particularly for the rich ecosystem of the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref name = "vanaqua"&gt;[http://www.vanaqua.org/research/ Research], [http://www.vanaqua.org/ Vancouver Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vancouver Aquarium]] was the first aquarium to capture and display an [[orca]] whale, Moby Doll, for three months in 1964; as well as [[Beluga (whale)|belugas]], [[narwhals]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mi.mun.ca/mi-net/fishdeve/cetace14.htm Narwhal (Monodon monoceros)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526034038/http://www.mi.mun.ca/mi-net/fishdeve/cetace14.htm |date=2008-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dolphin]]s. The [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] was the first public aquarium to display a [[great white shark]]. Beginning in September 2004, the Outer Bay exhibit (now the Open Sea galleries) was the home to the first in a series of great white sharks. The shark was at the aquarium for 198 days (the previous record was 16 days). The shark was released on March 31, 2005. The [[Adventure Aquarium]] in New Jersey has [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s. The [[Aquarium du Quebec]] houses [[polar bear]]s.

In [[international relations]], '''public diplomacy''' or '''people's diplomacy''', broadly speaking, is the communication with and dissemination of [[propaganda]] to the general public of foreign nations to establish a dialogue designed to inform and influence. As the international order has changed over the 20th century, so has the practice of public diplomacy. Its practitioners use a variety of instruments and methods ranging from personal contact and media interviews to the Internet and educational exchanges.

== Background and definitions==

In his essay "'Public Diplomacy' Before Gullion: The Evolution of a Phrase," [[Nicholas J. Cull]] of the [[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] writes, "The earliest use of the phrase 'public diplomacy' to surface is actually not American at all but in a leader piece from the [[London Times]] in January 1856. It is used merely as a synonym for civility in a piece criticizing the posturing of President [[Franklin Pierce]]." Cull writes that Edmund Gullion, dean of the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]] and a distinguished retired foreign service officer, "was the first to use the phrase in its modern meaning."&lt;ref name=Cull2006&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/060418_public_diplomacy_before_gullion_the_evolution_of_a_phrase|title= 'Public Diplomacy' Before Gullion: The Evolution of a Phrase|last1= Cull|first1= Nicholas|date= Apr 18, 2006|website= USCPublicDiplomacy|publisher= University of Southern California|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Gullion founded the Edward R. Murrow Center of Public Diplomacy, and Cull writes "An early Murrow Center brochure provided a convenient summary of Gullion's concept":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Public diplomacy... deals with the influence of public attitudes on the formation and execution of foreign policies. It encompasses dimensions of international relations beyond traditional diplomacy; the cultivation by governments of public opinion in other countries; the interaction of private groups and interests in one country with another; the reporting of foreign affairs and its impact on policy; communication between those whose job is communication, as diplomats and foreign correspondents; and the process of intercultural communications.&lt;ref name=Cull2006/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over time, the concept and definition has evolved by various practitioners

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most important roles public diplomacy will have to play for the United States in the current international environment will be less grand-strategic and more operational than during the Cold War. Support of national policy in military contingencies is one such role, and probably the most important.&lt;br/&gt;
— Carnes Lord (former Deputy Director USIA), Professor of Statecraft and Civilization, October 1998&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://fletcher.tufts.edu/murrow/pd/definitions.html The Edward R. Murrow Center - The Fletcher School - Tufts University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617004930/http://fletcher.tufts.edu/murrow/pd/definitions.html |date=2010-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public diplomacy – effectively communicating with publics around the globe – to understand, value and even emulate America's vision and ideas; historically one of America's most effective weapons of outreach, persuasion and policy.&lt;br /&gt;
— Jill A. Schuker (former Senior Director for Public Affairs at the National Security Council) July 2004&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Public diplomacy's 21st century trend is dominated by fractal globalization, preemptive military invasion, information and communication technologies that shrink time and distance, and the rise of global non-state actors (terror networks, bloggers) that challenge state-driven policy and discourse on the subject.&lt;br/&gt;
— (Nancy Snow, ''Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy'', ''2009'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Public diplomacy may be defined, simply, as the conduct of international relations by governments through public communications media and through dealings with a wide range of nongovernmental entities (political parties, corporations, trade associations, labor unions, educational institutions, religious organizations, ethnic groups, and so on including influential individuals) for the purpose of influencing the politics and actions of other governments.&lt;br/&gt;

— Alan K. Henrikson, Professor of Diplomatic History, April 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Public diplomacy that traditionally represents actions of governments to influence overseas publics within the foreign policy process has expanded today – by accident and design – beyond the realm of governments to include the media, multinational corporations, NGO's and faith-based organizations as active participants in the field. &lt;br/&gt;
— Crocker Snow Jr., Acting Director Edward R. Murrow Center, May 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"PUBLIC DIPLOMACY refers to government-sponsored programs intended to inform or influence public opinion in other countries; its chief instruments are publications, motion pictures, cultural exchanges, radio and television." (U.S. Department of State, Dictionary of International Relations Terms, 1987, p. 85)&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.publicdiplomacy.org/1.htm Public diplomacy - what it is and is not&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The United States Information Agency (USIA), which was the main government agency in charge of Public Diplomacy until it merged with the Department of State in 1999, described it as:

Public diplomacy seeks to promote the national interest and the [[national security of the United States]] through understanding, informing, and influencing foreign publics and broadening dialogue between American citizens and institutions and their counterparts abroad.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For The Planning Group for Integration of USIA into the Dept. of State (June 20, 1997), public diplomacy is defined as follows: "Public Diplomacy seeks to promote the national interest of the United States through understanding, informing and influencing foreign audiences."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Hans N. Tuch, author of Communicating With the World (St. Martin's Press, NY, 1990), public diplomacy is defined as: 
"Official government efforts to shape the communications environment overseas in which American foreign policy is played out, in order to reduce the degree to which misperceptions and misunderstandings complicate relations between the U.S. and other nations."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Standard [[diplomacy]] might be described as the ways in which government leaders communicate with each other at the highest levels, the elite diplomacy we are all familiar with. Public diplomacy, by contrast focuses on the ways in which a country (or multi-lateral organization such as the United Nations) communicates with citizens in other societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscpublicdiplomacy.org USC Center on Public Diplomacy]&lt;/ref&gt;  A country may be acting deliberately or inadvertently, and through both official and private individuals and institutions. Effective public diplomacy starts from the premise that dialogue, rather than a sales pitch, is often central to achieving the goals of foreign policy: public diplomacy must be seen as a two-way street. Furthermore, public diplomacy activities often present many differing views as represented by private American individuals and organizations in addition to official U.S. Government views.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.publicdiplomacy.org/1.htm#traditional Public diplomacy - what it is and is not&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional diplomacy actively engages one government with another government. In traditional diplomacy, U.S. Embassy officials represent the U.S. Government in a host country primarily by maintaining relations and conducting official USG business with the officials of the host government whereas public diplomacy primarily engages many diverse non-government elements of a society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Film, television, music, sports, video games and other social/cultural activities are seen by public diplomacy advocates as enormously important avenues for otherwise diverse citizens to understand each other and integral to the international cultural understanding, which they state is a key goal of modern public diplomacy strategy. It involves not only shaping the message(s) that a country wishes to present abroad, but also analyzing and understanding the ways that the message is interpreted by diverse societies and developing the tools of listening and conversation as well as the tools of persuasion.

One of the most successful initiatives which embodies the principles of effective public diplomacy is the creation by international treaty in the 1950s of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] which later became the [[European Union]]. Its original purpose after [[World War II]] was to tie the economies of Europe together so much that war would be impossible. Supporters of European integration see it as having achieved both this goal and the extra benefit of catalysing greater international understanding as European countries did more business together and the ties among member states' citizens increased.  Opponents of European integration are leery of a loss of national [[sovereignty]] and greater centralization of power.

Public diplomacy has been an essential element of American foreign policy for decades.  It was an important tool in influencing public opinion during the [[Cold War]] with the former [[Soviet Union]].  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the term has come back into vogue as the United States government works to improve their reputation abroad, particularly in the Middle East and among those in the Islamic world.  Numerous panels, including those sponsored by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], have evaluated American efforts in public diplomacy since [[9/11]] and have written reports recommending that the United States take various actions to improve the effectiveness of their public diplomacy.

The [[United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy]] was established in the late 1940s to evaluate American public diplomacy effort.  The Commission is a seven-member bipartisan board whose members are nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate.  William Hybl is the current chair, and other members include former Ambassadors [[Lyndon Olson]] and [[Penne Percy Korth Peacock]], as well as [[Jay T. Snyder|Jay Snyder]], [[John E. Osborn]] and Lezlee Westine.

This traditional concept is expanded on with the idea of adopting what is called "population-centric foreign affairs" within which foreign populations assume a central component of foreign policy.  Since people, not just states, are of global importance in a world where technology and migration increasingly face everyone, an entire new door of policy is opened.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crisisproject.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812235523/http://crisisproject.org/ |date=2008-08-12 }} Transnational Crisis Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
There are many methods and instruments that are used in public diplomacy. [[Nicholas J. Cull]] divides the practice into five elements: listening, advocacy, [[cultural diplomacy]], exchange diplomacy and [[international broadcasting]] (IB).&lt;ref&gt;The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 2008 616: 31, Nicholas J. Cull Public Diplomacy: Taxonomies and Histories&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International broadcasting]] remains a key element in public diplomacy in the 21st century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rawnsley |first1=Gary |title=Introduction to “International Broadcasting and Public Diplomacy in the 21st Century” |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=2 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/issue/view/41}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with traditionally weaker states having the opportunity to challenge the hegemony and monopoly of information provided by more powerful states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abdel Samei |first1=Marwa |title=Public Diplomacy and the Clash of Satellites |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i2.385 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods such as personal contact, broadcasters such as the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty&lt;ref&gt;Tuch, Hans N., Communicating with the World: U.S. Public Diplomacy Overseas, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1990, chapter 1, pp.3-11&lt;/ref&gt; exchange programs such as Fulbright and the International Visitor Leadership program, American arts and performances in foreign countries, and the use of the Internet are all instruments used for practicing public diplomacy depending on the audience to be communicated with and the message to be conveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Kiehl, America's dialogue with the world, Public Diplomacy Council, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public hypersphere''' is a new kind of public sphere that has come into existence globally through the use of modern information technology, digital media, and computer networks.

Swedish writer [[Karl-Erik Tallmo]] used the corresponding Swedish term ''hyperoffentlighet'' in an article in the daily ''Sydsvenska Dagbladet'' in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Tallmo, K-E, "Konsten att låsa köksdörren på nätet", ''Sydsvenska Dagbladet'' November 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same year also the English expression ''public hypersphere'' in an article in the journal ''Human IT''.&lt;ref&gt;Tallmo, K-E, "Self-publishing: publicera själv eller publicera sig själv?", ''Human IT'' nr 3/1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from [[Jürgen Habermas]] and his thoughts concerning a ''bourgeois public sphere''. The public hypersphere, however, is not limited to publishing or the European café culture, not even to the Internet but includes the larger part of human relations, mediated or not. It encompasses both voluntary participation as well as involuntary, through mass surveillance: "The electronic traces we leave constantly write our autobiographies ... [The public hypersphere is] a gas that fills the entire available space, it is 'the place that doesn't exist'." The public hypersphere is "not just public or transparent to a higher degree than the regular public sphere; it has a whole new structure. Mathematicians talk about ''hyperspheres'' when they want to describe a sphere of higher dimensionality, where normal geometric rules don't apply – here, the shortest path between two points is not necessarily a straight line."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slowfox.wordpress.com/2005/04/04/our-new-public-hypersphere/
| first=Karl-Erik | last=Tallmo | title=Our new public hypersphere | work=Slowfox (blog) | date=2005-04-04 | accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French philosopher and media scholar [[Pierre Lévy]] used the expression  ''l'hypersphère publique'' in an article in 2011 in the journal ''Medium''. He describes the combined effect of social media, real time functions, and wireless technology. He mentions API programming as important when it comes to connecting various databases with different interfaces. He writes that traditional information monopolies are dissolved and a kind of ''[[digital ecosystem]]'' has evolved, where old and new media interact. Citizens gain new liberties in expressing and retrieving information but also new ways to establish personal contacts. All these new phenomena "contribute in building a ubiquitous medium, hypercomplex and fractal, that everyone, ''nolens volens'', partake in designing, directing and using ..."&lt;ref&gt;Lévy Pierre, "L'hypersphère publique", ''Médium'' nr 4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy has also written about the transformation of the public sphere in his book ''Cyberdémocratie'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Lévy Pierre, ''Cyberdémocratie'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, the word ''Hyperöffentlichkeit'' has been used by sociologist [[Udo Thiedeke]] in his characterization of [[Howard Rheingold | Howard Rheingold's]] ideas concerning the virtual community,&lt;ref&gt;Rheingold, H.S., ''The Virtual Community: Homestanding on the Electronic Frontier'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; that is a high degree of participation and interactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Thiedeke, Udo, "Virtuelle Gruppen. Begriff und Charakteristik", i ''Virtuelle Gruppen. Charakteristika und Problemdimensionen'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''race of the future''' is a theoretical composite [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] which will result from ongoing [[racial admixture]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Conniff, "[http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2012_05/feature_eugenics.html God and White Men at Yale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028042755/http://yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2012_05/feature_eugenics.html |date=28 October 2012 }}", ''Yale Alumni Magazine'', May/June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] in 1925 in ''Practical Idealism'' predicted: "The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]-[[Negroid]] race of the future will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;''Praktischer Idealismus'', Wien/Leipzig 1925, pages 20, 23, 50&lt;/ref&gt; The same scenario had been envisaged, with rather less enthusiasm, by [[Madison Grant]] in his 1916 ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', calling for a [[eugenics]] program to prevent this development, and in a similar ideological context in [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]'' in 1920.

==History==
[[Gottfried de Purucker]] was an author and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] who, when asked about [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] in 1930, said "In answering your question very briefly, I can say simply this, that the time has not come when I would willingly suggest intermarriage; but I am in honesty bound to qualify that by saying that the race of the future will be a composite, composed of the many different races on earth today. Let us also remember that all men are ultimately of one blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/dialogue/dial13.htm|title=KTMG Papers: Thirteen|work=The Dialogues of G. de Purucker|publisher=Theosophical University Press|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''miscegenation'' was used in an anonymous propaganda pamphlet printed in [[New York City]] in late 1863, entitled [[Miscegenation hoax|''Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro''.]] The pamphlet purported to be in favor of [[interbreeding]] of whites and [[Black people|blacks]] until the races were indistinguishably mixed as [[mulatto]]s, claiming that this was the goal of the [[United States Republican Party]]. The real authors were [[David Goodman Croly]], managing editor of the ''[[New York World]]'', a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] paper, and [[George Wakeman]], a ''World'' reporter. The pamphlet soon was exposed as an attempt to discredit the Republicans, the [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] administration, and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] by exploiting the fears and racial biases common among whites. Nonetheless, this pamphlet and variations on it were reprinted widely in communities on both sides of the [[American Civil War]] by opponents of Republicans.

The British colony of [[Maryland]] was the first to pass an anti-miscegenation law (1664).&lt;ref name="Pascoe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hnn.us/articles/4708.html|title=Why the Ugly Rhetoric Against Gay Marriage Is Familiar to this Historian of Miscegenation | last=Pascoe | first=Peggy | authorlink=Peggy Pascoe | date=2004-04-19 | work=History News Network | publisher=George Mason University | accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century, many American states passed [[anti-miscegenation laws]], often based on controversial interpretations of the [[Bible]], particularly the story of [[Phinehas, son of Eleazar|Phinehas]]. Typically a [[felony]], these laws prohibited the solemnization of weddings between persons of different races and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of [[adultery]] or [[fornication]] would be brought against them instead. Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii, and the federal District of Columbia did not pass anti-miscegenation laws. In 1883, the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws was upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=106&amp;invol=583 Pace v. Alabama]''.

In 1948, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] in ''[[Perez v. Sharp]]'' effectively repealed the California anti-miscegenation statutes, thereby making California the first state in the twentieth century to do so. In 1967, the remaining anti-miscegenation laws in 16 states were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.

==Multiracial populations==
===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], as much as 44% of the population classify themselves as [[Pardo Brazilians|Pardo]] (multiracial).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl.asp?c=262&amp;i=P&amp;nome=on&amp;notarodape=on&amp;tab=262&amp;unit=0&amp;pov=3&amp;opc1=1&amp;poc2=1&amp;OpcTipoNivt=1&amp;opn1=2&amp;nivt=0&amp;orc86=3&amp;poc1=1&amp;orp=6&amp;qtu3=27&amp;opv=1&amp;poc86=2&amp;sec1=0&amp;opc2=1&amp;pop=1&amp;opn2=0&amp;orv=2&amp;orc2=5&amp;qtu2=5&amp;sev=93&amp;sev=1000093&amp;opc86=1&amp;sec2=0&amp;opp=1&amp;opn3=0&amp;sec86=0&amp;sec86=2776&amp;sec86=2777&amp;sec86=2779&amp;sec86=2778&amp;sec86=2780&amp;sec86=2781&amp;ascendente=on&amp;sep=43344&amp;orn=1&amp;qtu7=9&amp;orc1=4&amp;qtu1=1&amp;cabec=on&amp;pon=1&amp;OpcCara=44&amp;proc=1&amp;opn7=0&amp;decm=99 "População residente, por cor ou raça, situação e sexo."] IBGE - PNAD.&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically a mix of White, Black and Native American.

===United States===
[[William Quan Judge]] was a 19th century theosophist who wrote in his book [http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/aechoes.htm Echoes from the Orient]; "We are preparing here in America a new race which will exhibit the perfection of the glories that I said were being slowly brought to the surface from the long forgotten past ... Here, and nowhere else, are to be found men and women of every race living together, being governed together, attacking nature and the problems of life together, and bringing forth children who combine, each one, two races. This process will go on until in the course of many generations there will be produced on the American continents an entirely new race; new bodies; new orders of intellect; new powers of the mind."

In the United States, the proportion of [[multiracial American]] children is growing. Interracial partnerships are rising, as are transracial [[adoption]]s. In 1990, about 14% of 18- and 19-year-olds, 12% of 20- and 21-year-olds, and 7% of 34- and 35-year-olds were involved in interracial [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]s (Joyner and Kao, 2005). &lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov05/interracial.couples.ssl.html|title=Interracial relationships are on the increase in U.S., but decline with age, Cornell study finds|last=Lang|first=Susan S.|date=2005-11-02|work=Chronicle Online|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 in the United States, 15% of new marriages were interracial, with 9% of whites, 17% of blacks, 26% of Hispanics and 28% of Asians married outside of their race. Of the 275,000 new interracial marriages in 2010, 43% were white-[[mestizo]], 14.4% were white-Asian, 11.9% were white-black and the rest were other combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204880404577226981780914906?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories|title=More Marriages Cross Race, Ethnicity Lines|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other views==
According to [[anthropologist]] [[Henry Harpending]], human populations are actually diverging from one another, as opposed to melding into a single population. Harpending stated "Human races are evolving away from each other ... Genes are evolving fast in Europe, Asia and Africa, but almost all of these are unique to their continent of origin. We are getting less alike, not merging into a single, mixed humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news116529402.html|title=Are humans evolving faster? Findings suggest we are becoming more different, not alike|work=physorg.com|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

In [[inoculation theory]], refutational preemption consists of “specific content that receivers can employ to strengthen attitudes against subsequent change.”{{R|"KYLE1997"}} Drawing on [[William J. McGuire|McGuire]] &amp; Papageorgis, Pfau, et al. define the refutational preemption, or [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pretreatment pretreatment], step of the inoculation [[process]]: "The [[theory]] posits that refutational pretreatments, which raise the specter of content potentially damaging to the receiver’s attitude while simultaneously providing direct [[refutation]] of that content in the presence of a supportive environment, threaten the [[individual]]. This triggers the [[motivation]] to bolster [[arguments]] supporting the receiver’s attitudes, thus conferring resistance".{{R|"Pfau1990"}}

Instead of providing the receiver with additional supporting [[evidence]] why their held [[beliefs]] are true, the receiver is provided [[counterarguments]] they may encounter in the future that might challenge their held belief. The effectiveness of this inoculation falls off as the level of effort required by the receiver to defend the belief increases.{{R|"McGuire1961"}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10826">'''Renaissance Weekend''' is an American retreat for leaders in business and finance, government, the media, religion, medicine, science, technology and the arts. Conversations are off the record and subject matter ranges widely, tending to focus heavily on policy and business issues.&lt;ref name="theroux46"&gt;{{cite book |last=Theroux |first=Paul |date=2015 |title=[[Deep South: Four Seasons on Back Roads]] |location=London, UK |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |page=46 |isbn=9780241146729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1980 on [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]] by Linda LeSourd Lader and her husband [[Philip Lader]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/us/bill-hillary-and-other-plain-folks-are-all-set-for-one-heady-weekend.html|title=Bill, Hillary and Other Plain Folks Are All Set for One Heady Weekend|last=Jehl|first=Douglas|date=1993-12-31|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former U.S. Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]], Renaissance Weekends, now held in several locations each year, are structured to encourage the transcendence of political, economic, and religious differences by bringing together distinguished participants from a wide range of fields, including CEOs, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, Nobel Laureates and Pulitzer Prize-winners, artists and scientists, astronauts and Olympians, judges, diplomats and Presidents, Prime Ministers, professors and priests, Republicans, Democrats and Independents.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20151228/PC1603/151229472/1031/renaissance-weekend-returns-to-charleston|title=Renaissance Weekend returns to Charleston|date=2015-12-28|website=Post and Courier|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Weekends are geared towards the establishment of an environment free of partisanship and commercialism, where "civility prevails." Membership is by invitation only.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sixty families pioneered the Lader's 1980 [[New Year]]'s [[house party]]. The result has been a cross-generational "continuing conversation" of individuals with broadly divergent perspectives, no [[political agenda]], but a legacy of ideas and friendships.

==Objectives==
{{Expand section|organizational structure, funding/business model|date=March 2010}}The mission is "To build bridges among innovative leaders with exceptionally diverse perspectives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-clinton-renaissance/article/630050|title=The Clinton Renaissance®|date=2012-02-27|website=Weekly Standard|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Renaissance Weekend seeks to build bridges across traditional divides of professions, politics, geography, age, religions, philosophies, religion, and race.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.live5news.com/story/30842553/annual-renaissance-weekend-starts-with-interfaith-service-at-mother-emanuel|title=Annual Renaissance Weekend starts with interfaith service at Mother Emanuel|last=Wallace|first=Meaghan|website=Live5news|publisher=Frankly and Raycom Media|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For over 25 years, these family retreats' objective has been to encourage personal and national renewal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Through hundreds of panels, seminars and workshops each Weekend, participants themselves address such public policy and personal concerns as "America's Responsibility to the World," "Investment Perspectives," "How the Media has Covered the War Against Terrorism," "[[Corporate Governance]] After [[Enron]]," "Beating Cancer," "My Family's Legacies for Life," and "[[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] &amp; [[Islam]] - Eternal Truths &amp; Current Myths."

== Attendees ==
"More than 1,000 participants will take part in 500 lectures, seminars, discussions and performances during the four-day event."

This article lists the statutory '''retirement age''' in different countries. In some contexts, the [[retirement]] age is the age at which a person is expected or required to cease work and is usually the age at which they may be entitled to receive [[pension|superannuation]] or other government benefits, like a [[state pension]]. Policy makers usually consider the demography, fiscal cost of ageing, health, life expectancy, nature of profession, supply of labour force etc. while deciding the retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cppr.in/archives/setting-an-ideal-retirement-age/|title=Setting an Ideal Retirement Age!|work=Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407060852/http://www.cppr.in/archives/setting-an-ideal-retirement-age/|archivedate=7 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the countries listed in the table below are in the process of reforming the ages (see the notes in the table for details). The ages in the table show when an individual retires if they retire/have retired in the year given in the table; the trend in some countries is that in the future the age will increase gradually (where available, explanations are given in the section on notes), therefore one's year of birth determines when one has the age of retirement (e.g. in Romania women born in January 1955 had the retirement age in January 2015 at age 60; those born in January 1958 will retire in January 2019 at age 61; those born in January 1961 will retire in January 2023 at age 62; those born in January 1967 will retire in January 2030 at age 63).&lt;ref name="cjpensiiarad.ro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjpensiiarad.ro/pensii6.php|title=Casa Judeteana de Pensii Arad|publisher=cjpensiiarad.ro|accessdate=23 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805074556/http://www.cjpensiiarad.ro/pensii6.php|archivedate=5 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one may receive a reduced CPP retirement pension as early as the month following the 60th birthday. Alternatively, one may receive an increased pension after reaching age 65. Canada also has a pension supplement with different rules called Old Age Security (OAS).

|The retirement age for an employee depends on the employment contract. Upon retirement, the retired employee should be given his/her benefits according to the agreement or contract between the employer and the employee. However, if there is no existing retirement plan or agreement for the employee, he/she may retire at the age of 60, given that he/she has served the employer for 5 years, and shall be given a retirement pay of at least half a month’s salary for every year of service (6 months of work given is considered as 1 whole year for the retirement pay).

The average of statutory retirement age in the 34 countries of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 2014 was males 65 years and females 63.5 years, but the tendency all over the world is to increase the retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = John | last = Scott | url = http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/aging-australians-balk-worlds-oldest-retirement-age/ | title = Aging Australians Balk at World’s Oldest Retirement Age | date = 25 June 2014 | publisher = BeritaSatu Media Holdings | location = Jakarta | accessdate = 10 March 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140912153533/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/aging-australians-balk-worlds-oldest-retirement-age/ | archivedate = 12 September 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reflected by the findings that just over half the Asian investors surveyed region-wide said they agreed with raising the retirement age, with a quarter disagreeing and the remainder undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.manulife.com/public/news/detail/0,,lang=en&amp;artId=147865&amp;navId=630002,00.html | title = Asians Want To See Official Retirement Ages Rise – Manulife Survey | publisher = The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company | location = Hong Kong | date = 22 May 2014 | accessdate = 10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reform ==
Reforms tend to be phased-in slowly when the retirement age (or pension age) is increased, with [[grandfathering]] ensuring a gradual change. In contrast, when the age of retirement is decreased, changes are often brought about rapidly.&lt;ref name="Blair2014-p107"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Blair|title=Securing Pension Provision: The Challenge of Reforming the Age of Entitlement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvc7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|date=8 August 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-45397-6|page=107|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506014926/https://books.google.com/books?id=hvc7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|archivedate=6 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such example of grandfathering are the transitional pension rules which were applied for staff aged 54 years or older, and to some extent for all staff in place, when in 2014 the [[European Civil Service#Pensions|retirement age of European civil servants]] was increased to 66 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Irene Souka|url=http://www.u4unity.eu/document2/SR_HR20130712.pdf#page=12|title=Review of the Staff Regulations|date=July 2013|format=PDF|page=12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219020815/http://www.u4unity.eu/document2/SR_HR20130712.pdf#page=12|archivedate=19 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men either retire later than women or at the same time. This is being addressed in some countries where the retirement ages are being equalised.

It includes [[violence]] between school students as well as  physical attacks by students on school staff.

==Risk factors==

===Internalizing and externalizing behaviors===

A distinction is made between internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Internalizing behavior has been found in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;Christie, C.A., Nelson, C.M., &amp; Jolivet, K. (2005). [http://www.edjj.org/focus/prevention/plr.pdf ''Prevention of antisocial and violent behavior in youth: A review of the literature''.] Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky. Retrieved 2009-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1983). Psychological mechanisms of aggression. In R. G. Geen &amp; E. I. Donnerstein (Eds.), ''Aggression: Theoretical and empirical reviews''. New York: Academic. {{ISBN|0-12-278801-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akers | first1 = R.

===Other individual factors===

A number of other individual factors are associated with higher levels of aggressiveness. Compared to children whose antisocial conduct begins in adolescence, early starters have a worse prognosis in terms of future aggression and other antisocial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579498001734 | last1 = Patterson | first1 = G.

===Home environment===
The home environment is thought to contribute to school violence. The Constitutional Rights Foundation suggests long-term exposure to [[gun]] violence, parental [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], physical abuse of the child, and child sexual abuse teaches children that criminal and violent activities are acceptable.&lt;ref name="CRE"&gt;Constitutional Rights Foundation. (1997). [http://www.crf-usa.org/school-violence/causes-of-school-violence.html  ''Causes of school violence'']. Retrieved on April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Harsh parental discipline is associated with higher levels of aggressiveness in youth.&lt;ref name="Sampson"/&gt; There is some evidence indicating that exposure to [[television violence]]&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, B.

Straus adduced evidence for the view that exposure to parental [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] increases the risk of aggressive conduct in children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/sp.1991.38.2.03a00010 | last1 = Straus | first1 = M.

==Prevention and intervention==
The goal of prevention and intervention strategies is to stop school violence from occurring. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], there are at least four levels at which violence-prevention programs can act: at the level of society in general, the school community, the family, and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

* Teachers are the professional group who works directly where school bullying takes place and who spends the most time with both bullies, victims and bystanders.

== Challenges in measuring violence in schools ==
Research on violence affecting children in schools is challenging for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methodological issues ===
When trying to measure the scope of violence in schools and to find out about the types of violence experienced by students, some key issues include: from what categories of the school community to collect the data; what data should be collected from each categories; and using which methods. For example, should there be studies or surveys where researchers ask students directly about violence in school, through self-reports about the violence they experienced as targets or perpetrators? Or should they be asked about incidents of violence that they have witnessed as bystanders? Should any of these questions be asked via self-administered questionnaires or questionnaires administered by researchers in schools? Does it make more sense to collect this data outside of schools, for example, through household surveys? Or through online surveys where students have access to the internet? Or is it better to rely on mechanisms for reporting incidents of violence in educational institutions when they are available, either in the schools themselves or outside schools (governmental hotlines, internet-based reporting systems, police and justice sectors, etc.)? What questions can be asked of children, using terminology that is easy to understand, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
In most countries there are strict rules related to research involving children, as they are under the age of consent. Therefore, requesting informed consent from the children in a study involves their parents and guardians. Asking children about violence, and particularly violence they have experienced themselves, can be traumatic. Finally, researching [[Education and the LGBT community|issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/orientation in education]] and in relation to children has additional challenges. In some contexts it is not legal to discuss these issues either in schools or even outside of schools. Where it is legal, it may be considered as a very sensitive topic to be discussed with children and young people. Asking children and young people questions related to their sexual orientation and gender identity in the school setting is ethically questionable, as it could embarrass them and expose them to stigma and discrimination, unless questions are asked in strict confidence and anonymity is granted by independent researchers external to schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's linear model of communication and created the '''Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication''', which separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The process of communication. New York,|last=Berlo|first=David|publisher=Rinehart, &amp; Winston.|year=1960|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlo described factors affecting the individual components in the communication making the communication more efficient.

== Background ==
The Berlo’s Model of Communication has developed from Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver’s mathematical model, which was first published in “Bell System Technical Journal” in 1948. The model was primary designed to improve the technical communication, but was later widely applied in different fields of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals &amp; Noise|last=John Robinson Pierce|first=|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1980|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Shannon-Weaver Model, communication includes the following concepts: sender, encoder, channel, decoder, receiver and feedback. Furthermore, there is also concept of “noise”, which affects the communication process going through the channel and makes the message more difficult to understand by the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Claude|date=|title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication|url=|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|volume=27|pages=379–423, 623–656.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of those concepts are defined as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
'''Sender:''' the originator of message.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Encoder:''' the transmitter which converts the message into signals (the way message is changed into signals, for example sound waves).&lt;br /&gt;
'''Decoder:''' the reception place of the signal which converts signals into message. Decoding is done by the receiver when he gets the message.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Receiver:''' the recipient of the message from the sender.  He usually gives feedback to the sender in order to make sure that the message was properly received.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Noise:''' the message is transferred through a channel, which can be interrupted by external noise like horn sounds, thunder and crowd noise. Thus, the receiver can get an inaccurate message. This is why feedback from the receiver is important in case the message is not properly received. Furthermore, the noise can also affect the decoding of the message by the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mathematical Theory of Communication|last=Weaver, Warren and Shannon, Claude Elwood|first=|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1963|isbn=0-252-72548-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Practical Example of  Shannon-Weaver model of communication : &lt;br /&gt;
Thomson made call to his assistant “come here I want to see you”.  During his call, noise appeared (transmission error) and his assistant received “I want” only. Again Assistant asked Thomson (feedback) “what do you want Thomson”.
# Sender: Thomson
# Encoder: Telephone (Thomson)
# Channel: Cable 
# Noise: Distraction in voice 
# Decoder: Telephone (Assistant)
# Receiver: Assistant. 
Berlo's Model was first published in 1960 in the book entitled El Proceso de la Comunicación or the process of communication. The model includes four components to describe the communication process: sender, message, channel and receiver, each of the them are affected by many factors. The model also focuses on encoding and decoding, which happens before sender sends the message and before receiver receives the message respectively.

The main feature from the previous Shannon-Weaver model is the focus on the purpose and objectives of communication. Berlo's model also includes verbal and non-verbal communications, it considers the emotional aspects of the message.

== Components of Berlo's Model of Communication ==
David Berlo's Model of Communication explains the various components in the communication process. The four basic components are sender (or source), message, channel and receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of communication models, perspectives, strategies|last=Uma Narula|first=|publisher=Atlantic publishers&amp;distributors|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== S-Sender ===
Sender is the source of the message or the person who originates the message and sends it to the receiver. The sender transfers the information by using following factors: 
* Communication Skills (ability to read, write, speak, listen etc.) directly affects the communication process.
An individual must possess excellent communication skills to make his communication effective and create an impact on the listeners. He should know how to speak and how pronounce a word correctly, where to take pauses and where to repeat and so on. Similarly, to the receiver. If he can not understand the message, the communication will be ineffective. 
* Attitudes towards the audience, subject, etc.  
The attitude of the sender and the receiver effects of the message. The person's attitude towardsl the receiver and the environment changes the meaning and effect of the message.
* Knowledge 
In this context knowledge is not the level of education. It is the clarity of the information which sender wants to convey to the receiver. Familiarity with the subject of the message makes it easier to understand it.
* Social Systems. 
Values, beliefs, religion, laws, rules and general understanding of society affect the sender's way of communicating the message.
* Culture
Culture refers to the cultural background of the sender or receiver.

=== M-Message ===

The step of creating a message (also called encoding) is the transformation of thoughts into words that sender sends to receiver. It can be in the form of voice, audio, text, video or other media. Any message comprises the following elements:
* Content is the thing, which the whole message from beginning to end contains.
* Elements are the non-verbal basics like language, gestures, body language etc. Content is accompanied by some elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication for social change. Anthology: histirical and contemporary readings|last=Tufte|first=Thomas|publisher=Denise Dray-Felder|year=2006|isbn=0-9770357-9-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Treatment is the way in which the message is transferred to the receiver. Treatment also effects the feedback of the receiver.
* Structure of the message is the way it has been structured into various parts or arranged. It influences the effectiveness of the message.
* Code is the form in which the message is sent. It might be in the form of language, text, video, etc.

=== C-Channel ===
Channel  refers to the medium used to send the message. In mass communication technical machines might be used as a channel like telephone, internet, etc. But in general communication, the five senses of a human being is the channel for the communication flow and it affects the effectiveness of the channel:
* Hearing - We receive the message through hearing.
* Seeing - We perceive through seeing. We also get non-verbal messages by seeing.
* Touching - Many of the non-verbal communication happens from touching like holding hands.
* Smelling - We collect information from smelling.
* Tasting - Taste also provides the information to be sent as a message.

=== R-Receiver ===
Receiver is the person who gets the message and tries to understand what the sender actually wants to convey and then responds accordingly. This is also called as decoding. Berlo's model believes that the effective communication can be achieved if the sender and the receiver are on the same level. The message might not have the same effect as intended if the receiver and sender are not similar.

The receiver must also have a very good listening skill. Other factors are similar to that of the sender:
* Communication skills
* Attitudes
* Knowledge
* Social Systems
* Culture

== Criticisms of Berlo's SMCR Model ==
#There is no concept of feedback, so the effect is not considered.
#There is no concept of noise or any kind of barriers in communication process.
#It is a linear model of communication, there is no two way communication.
#Both of the people must be similar (on same level for communication) according to all the factors mentioned above. Thus, the model is not practical in real life.
#Main drawback of the model is that the model omits the usage of sixth sense as a channel which is actually a gift to the human beings (thinking, understanding, analyzing etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://communicationtheory.org/berlos-smcr-model-of-communication/|title=BERLO’S SMCR MODEL OF COMMUNICATION|work=Communication Theory|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlo's model was further developed in 1973 by W. Schramm, who used relational model instead of linear. Schramm also used the effects and effects analysis components from Berlo's model and suggested '''Interaction''' component in relation with active, selective and manipulative audience. He argued that the most dramatic change in the communication theory in the last 40 years has been the abandonment of the idea of passive audience. Audience is a full partner in the process of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wilbur Schramm and Noam Chomsky Meet Harold Innis: Media, Power, and Democracy|last=Robert E.

[[Social Science History]] is a quarterly, peer-reviewed academic journal. It is the official journal of the Social Science History Association. Its articles bring an analytic, theoretical, and often quantitative approach to historical evidence. The journal's founders intended to "improve the quality of historical explanation" with "theories and methods from the social science disciplines" and to make generalizations across historical cases.&lt;ref name=founders&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1170928 Editors' Foreword], 1976.

The "Social Science History Association" was formed in 1976 as an interdisciplinary group with a journal ''[[Social Science History]]'' and an annual convention. The goal was to incorporate in historical studies perspectives from all the social sciences, especially political science, sociology and economics. The pioneers shared a commitment to quantification. However, by the 1980s the first blush of quantification had worn off, as critics complained that quantification undervalued the role of contingency, and warned against a naive positivism. Meanwhile quantification  became well-established inside economics, in the field of cliometrics, as well as in political science. In history, quantification remained central to demographic studies, but slipped behind in political and social history.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey J.

{{Sociology}}
'''Social construction of technology''' (also referred to as '''SCOT''') is a theory within the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]]. Advocates of SCOT—that is, [[Social constructionism|social constructivists]]—argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology. They also argue that the ways a technology is used cannot be understood without understanding how that technology is embedded in its social context. SCOT is a response to [[technological determinism]] and is sometimes known as technological constructivism.

SCOT draws on work done in the constructivist school of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], and its subtopics include [[actor-network theory]]  (a branch of the [[sociology of science and technology]]) and historical analysis of sociotechnical systems, such as the work of historian [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. Its empirical methods are an adaptation of the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR), which outlines a method of analysis to demonstrate the ways in which scientific findings are socially constructed (see [[strong program]]). Leading adherents of SCOT include [[Wiebe Bijker]] and [[Trevor Pinch]].

SCOT holds that those who seek to understand the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a technology should look to the social world. It is not enough, according to SCOT, to explain a technology's success by saying that it is "the best"—researchers must look at how the criteria of being "the best" is defined and what groups and stakeholders participate in defining it. In particular, they must ask who defines the technical criteria success is measured by, why technical criteria are defined this way, and who is included or excluded.  Pinch and Bijker argue that technological determinism is a myth that results when one looks backwards and believes that the path taken to the present was the only possible path.

SCOT is not only a theory, but also a methodology: it formalizes the steps and principles to follow when one wants to analyze the causes of technological failures or successes.

==Legacy of the Strong Programme in the sociology of science==

At the point of its conception, the SCOT approach was partly motivated by the ideas of the [[strong programme]] in the sociology of science (Bloor 1973). In their seminal article, Pinch and Bijker refer to the ''Principle of Symmetry'' as the most influential tenet of the Sociology of Science, which should be applied in historical and sociological investigations of technology as well. It is strongly connected to Bloor's theory of social causation.

===Symmetry===

The ''Principle of Symmetry'' holds that in explaining the origins of scientific beliefs, that is, assessing the success and failure of models, theories, or experiments, the historian/sociologist should deploy the same ''kind'' of explanation in the cases of success as in cases of failure. When investigating beliefs, researchers should be impartial to the (''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' attributed) truth or falsehood of those beliefs, and the explanations should be unbiased. The strong programme adopts a position of relativism or neutralism regarding the arguments that social actors put forward for the acceptance/rejection of any technology.  All arguments (social, cultural, political, economic, as well as technical) are to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, EM García, et al. "Introdução aos estudos CTS (Ciência, Tecnologia e Sociedade)." Cadernos de Ibero America (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetry principle addresses the problem that the historian is tempted to explain the success of successful theories by referring to their "objective truth", or inherent "technical superiority", whereas s/he is more likely to put forward sociological explanations (citing political influence or economic reasons) only in the case of failures. For example, having experienced the obvious success of the chain-driven bicycle for decades, it is tempting to attribute its success to its "advanced technology" compared to the "primitiveness" of the [[Penny farthing|Penny Farthing]], but if we look closely and symmetrically at their history (as Pinch and Bijker do), we can see that at the beginning bicycles were valued according to quite different standards than nowadays. The early adopters (predominantly young, well-to-do gentlemen) valued the speed, the thrill, and the spectacularity of the Penny Farthing – in contrast to the security and stability of the chain-driven [[History of the bicycle|Safety Bicycle]]. Many other social factors (e.g., the contemporary state of urbanism and transport, women's clothing habits and feminism) have influenced and changed the relative valuations of bicycle models.

A weak reading of the ''Principle of Symmetry'' points out that there often are many competing theories or technologies, which all have the potential to provide slightly different solutions to similar problems. In these cases, sociological factors tip the balance between them: that's why we should pay equal attention to them.

A strong, social constructivist reading would add that even the emergence of the questions or problems to be solved are governed by social determinations, so the Principle of Symmetry is applicable even to the apparently purely technical issues.

== Core concepts ==

The following concepts and 'stages' of SCOT are adapted from the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR).&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, Trevor J. and Wiebe E. Bijker.  "The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other."  ''Social Studies of Science'' 14 (August 1984): 399-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretative flexibility===
''Interpretative flexibility'' means that each technological artifact has different meanings and interpretations for various groups. Bijker and Pinch show that the air tire of the bicycle meant a more convenient mode of transportation for some people, whereas it meant technical nuisances, traction problems and ugly [[aesthetics]] to others. In racing air tires lent to greater speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker2.pdf | title=The Social Constructions of Technological Systems | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | editor1=Wiebe E. Bijker | editor2= Thomas P. Hughes |editor3=Trevor Pinch |year=1987|isbn=0-262-02262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alternative interpretations generate different ''problems'' to be solved. How should aesthetics, convenience, and speed be prioritized? What is the "best" tradeoff between traction and speed?

====Relevant social groups====
The most basic relevant groups are the ''users'' and the ''producers'' of the technological artifact, but most often many subgroups can be delineated – users with different socioeconomic status, competing producers, etc. Sometimes there are relevant groups who are neither users, nor producers of the technology, for example, journalists, politicians, and civil organizations. [[Trevor Pinch]] has argued that the salespeople of technology should also be included in the study of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinch|first=Trevor|title=How Users Matter: The Co-Construction of Users and Technology|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-15107-3|pages=247–269|authorlink=Trevor Pinch|editor=Nelly Oudshoorn and Trevor Pinch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groups can be distinguished based on their shared or diverging interpretations of the technology in question.

====Design flexibility====
Just as technologies have different meanings in different social groups, there are always multiple ways of constructing technologies. A particular design is only a single point in the large field of technical possibilities, reflecting the interpretations of certain relevant groups.

====Problems and conflicts====
The different interpretations often give rise to conflicts between criteria that are hard to resolve technologically (e.g., in the case of the bicycle, one such problem was how a woman could ride the bicycle in a skirt while still adhering to standards of decency), or conflicts between the relevant groups (the "Anti-cyclists" lobbied for the banning of the bicycles). Different groups in different societies construct different problems, leading to different designs.

The first stage of the SCOT research methodology is to reconstruct the alternative interpretations of the technology, analyze the problems and conflicts these interpretations give rise to, and connect them to the design features of the technological artifacts. The relations between groups, problems, and designs can be visualized in diagrams.

===Closure&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Closure]] --&gt;===
Over time, as technologies are developed, the interpretative and design flexibility collapse through closure mechanisms. Two examples of closure mechanisms:

#'''Rhetorical closure''': When social groups ''see'' the problem as being solved, the need for alternative designs diminishes. This is often the result of advertising.
#'''Redefinition of the problem''': A design standing in the focus of conflicts can be stabilized by using it to solve a different, new problem, which ends up being solved by this very design. As an example, the aesthetic and technical problems of the air tire diminished, as the technology advanced to the stage where air tire bikes started to win the bike races. Tires were still considered cumbersome and ugly, but they provided a solution to the "speed problem", and this overrode previous concerns.

Closure is not permanent.  New social groups may form and reintroduce interpretative flexibility, causing a new round of debate or conflict about a technology. (For instance, in the 1890s automobiles were seen as the "green" alternative, a cleaner environmentally-friendly technology, to horse-powered vehicles; by the 1960s, new social groups had introduced new interpretations about the environmental effects of the automobile, eliciting the opposite conclusion.)

The second stage of the SCOT methodology is to show how closure is achieved.

===Relating the content of the technological artifact to the wider sociopolitical milieu===
This is the third stage of the SCOT methodology, but the seminal article of Pinch and Bijker does not proceed to this stage. Many other historians and sociologists of technology nevertheless do. For example, Paul N. Edwards shows in his book "The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America | publisher=The MIT Press | author=Paul N. Edwards | year=1997 | isbn=978-0262550284 | series=Inside Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strong relations between the political discourse of the Cold War and the computer designs of this era.

==Criticism==
In 1993, [[Langdon Winner]] published an influential critique of SCOT entitled "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|title=Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=Summer 1993|volume=18|issue=3|pages=362–378|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, he argues that social constructivism is an overly narrow research program. He identifies the following specific limitations in social constructivism:
# It explains how technologies arise, but ignores the consequences of the technologies after the fact. This results in a sociology that says nothing about how such technologies matter in the broader context.
# It examines social groups and interests that contribute to the construction of technology, but ignores those who have no voice in the process, yet are affected by it. Likewise, when documenting technological contingencies and choices, it fails to account for those options that never made it to the table. According to Winner, this results in conservative and elitist sociology.
# It is superficial in that it focuses on how the immediate needs, interests, problems and solutions of chosen social groups influence technological choice, but disregards any possible deeper cultural, intellectual or economic origins of social choices concerning technology.
# It actively avoids taking any kind of moral stance or passing judgment on the relative merits of the alternative interpretations of a technology. This indifference makes it unhelpful in addressing important debates about the place of technology in human affairs.
Other critics include [[Stewart Russell]] with his letter in the journal "[[Social Studies of Science]]" titled "The Social Construction of Artifacts: A Response to Pinch and Bijker".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71060">The '''spiral of silence theory''' is a [[political science]] and [[mass communication]] theory proposed by the [[Germany|German]] [[political scientist]] [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], which stipulates that individuals have a fear of [[solitude|isolation]], which results from the idea that a social group or the society in general might isolate, neglect, or exclude members due to the members' opinions. This fear of isolation consequently leads to remaining silent instead of voicing opinions. Media is an important factor that relates to both the dominant idea and people's perception of the dominant idea. The assessment of one's social environment may not always correlate with reality.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Background==
According to Shelly Neill, "Introduced in 1974, the Spiral of Silence Theory [...] explores hypotheses to determine why some groups remain silent while others are more vocal in forums of public disclosure."{{Sfn|Neill|2009|p=42}} The spiral of silence theory suggests that "people who have believed that they hold a minority viewpoint on a public issue will remain in the background where their communication will be restrained; those who believe that they hold a majority viewpoint will be more encouraged to speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Applicatinon|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-338507-5|location=New York|pages=411|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory explains the formation of social norms at both the micro and macro level. "As a micro-theory, the spiral of silence examines opinion expression, controlling for people's predispositions – such as fear of isolation, and also demographic variables that have been shown to influence people's willingness to publicly express opinions on issues, such as agricultural biotechnology."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} The spiral of silence occurs on a macro level if more and more members of the perceived minority fall silent. This is when public perceptions of the opinion climate begin to shift.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} "In other words, a person's individual reluctance to express his or her opinion, simply based on perceptions of what everyone else thinks, has important implications at the social level."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} As one opinion gains the interest of the majority, the minority faces threat and fear of isolation from society. As the opinion gains momentum by the majority, the minority continues to be threatened and falls deeper into their silence. It continues until the minority no longer speaks out against it, and the opinion of the perceived majority ultimately becomes a social norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Spiral model===
The spiral model is an analogy used to visually describe the theory. The end of the [[spiral]] refers to the number of people who are not publicly expressing their opinions, due to the fear of isolation. An individual is more likely to go down the spiral if his or her opinion does not conform with the perceived majority opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} The following steps summarize how the process works:
#We can distinguish between fields where the opinions and attitudes involved are static, and fields where those opinions and attitudes are subject to changes... Where opinions are relatively definite and static – for example, "customs" – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated.
#Individuals who, when observing their environments, notice that their own personal opinion is spreading and is taken over by others, will voice this opinion self-confidently in public. On the other hand, individuals who notice that their own opinions are losing ground will be inclined to adopt a more reserved attitude when expressing their opinions in public.
#It follows from this that, as the representatives of the first opinion talk quite a lot while the representatives of the second opinion remain silent, there is a definite influence on the environment: an opinion that is being reinforced in this way appears stronger than it really is, while an opinion suppressed as described will seem to be weaker than it is in reality.
#The result is a spiral process which prompts other individuals to perceive the changes in opinion and follow suit, until one opinion has become established as the prevailing attitude while the other opinion will be pushed back and rejected by everybody with the exception of the hard core that nevertheless sticks to that opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

This is a process of formation, change and reinforcement of public opinion. The tendency of the one to speak up and the other to be silent starts off a spiraling process which increasingly establishes one opinion as the dominant one. Over time, these changing perceptions establish one opinion as predominant one and they change from the liquid state to a solid norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

Further, Noelle-Neumann describes the spiral of silence as a [[Positive feedback|dynamic process]], in which predictions about public opinion become fact as mass media's coverage of the [[Majoritarianism|majority opinion]] becomes the [[status quo]], and the minority becomes less likely to speak out.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=278}}

==Epistemology==
===Public===
Scholars have long argued over the concept of ''public'' within "public opinion". The use of "[[public]]" and "the public" betrays multiple competing meanings.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} There are three meanings of public. One meaning is the legal sense of public that focuses on openness. For example, a public place or path. A second meaning for the term emphasizes public rights. Lastly, within the phrase public opinion, public is said to have a related but different definition. Public, in this sense, could be characterized as social psychology. Scholars have marveled in amazement at the power public opinion has in making regulations, norms, and moral rules triumph over the individual self without ever troubling legislators, governments or courts for assistance.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Opinion===
"Common [[Opinion]]" is what the Scottish social philosopher [[David Hume]] called it in his 1739 published work ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''. Agreement and a sense of the common is what lay behind the English and French "opinion."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} In researching the term opinion, ''meinung'' in German, researchers were led back to [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In Plato's ''Republic'', a quote from [[Socrates]] conclude that opinion takes the middle position. [[Immanuel Kant]] considered opinion to be an "insufficient judgement, subjectively as well as objectively."{{Sfn|Kant|1781|p=498}} How valuable opinion may be was left out; however, the fact that it is suggested to be unified agreement of a population, or segment of the population, was still considered.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Public opinion===
The term [[public opinion]] first emerged in France during the eighteenth century. The definition of public opinion has been debated over time. There has not been much progress in locking in one classification of the phrase ''[[public opinion]].'' [[Hermann Oncken]], a German historian, stated &lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever desires to grasp and define the concept of public opinion will recognize quickly that he is dealing with a [[Proteus]], a being that appears simultaneously in a thousand guises, both visible and as a phantom, impotent and surprisingly efficacious, which presents itself in innumerable transformations and is forever slipping through our fingers just as we believe we have a firm grip on it... That which floats and flows cannot be understood by being locked up in a formula... After all, when asked, everyone knows exactly what public opinion means.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; It was said to be a "fiction that belonged in a museum of the history of ideas; it could only be of historical interest."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

In contradiction to that quote, the term public opinion seemed to not cease. During the early 1970s, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann was creating the theory of the spiral of silence. She was making an effort to clarify the 1965 finding of which voting intentions would not change but yet expectations that one side would win continued to increase. Noelle-Nuemann began to question if she was indeed grabbing a handle on what public opinion actually was. "The spiral of silence might be one of the forms in which public opinion appeared; it might be a process through which a new, youthful public opinion develops or whereby the transformed meaning of an old opinion spreads."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

The American sociologist [[Edward Alsworth Ross|Edward Ross]] described [[public opinion]] in 1898 using the word "cheap". "The equation of 'public opinion' with 'ruling opinion' runs like a common thread through its many definitions. This speaks to the fact that something clinging to public opinion sets up conditions that move individuals to act, even against their own will."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Many possible meanings and definitions of the term have been explored. Scholars have considered the content of public opinion, assumed to consist of public affairs issues. Scholars point out that the emergence of the public opinion depends on an open public discourse rather than "on the discipline imposed by an apparent majority dominant enough to intimidate but whose views may or may not support actions that are in the common interest."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What is this Thing we Call Public Opinion? Reflections on the Spiral of Silence|url=http://ijpor.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/368|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 September 2012|issn=0954-2892|pages=368–386|volume=24|issue=3|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds014|language=en|first=Kurt|last=Lang|first2=Gladys Engel|last2=Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also considered whose opinion establishes public opinion, assumed to be persons of a community who are ready to express themselves responsibly about questions of public relevance. Scholars have also looked into the forms of public opinion, said to be those that are openly expressed and accessible; opinions that are made public, especially in the mass media. Controversy surrounding this term spiraled around both words combining to form the phrase.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Media and public opinion===
Mass media's effects on both public opinion and the perception of the public opinion are central to the Spiral of Silence Theory. One of the earliest works that called attention to the relationship between media and the formation of public opinion was [[Walter Lippmann]]'s book "Public Opinion," published in 1923.&lt;ref name="Lippmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lippmann|first1=W|title=Public opinion|date=1946|publisher=Transaction Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas of Lippmann regarding the effects of media influenced the emergence of the Spiral of Silence Theory. As she is building the spiral theory, Noelle-Neumann states "the reader can only complete and explain the world by making use of a consciousness which in large measure has been created by the mass media."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noelle-Neumann|first1=Elisabeth|title=The spiral of silence: Public opinion, our social skin|date=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agenda-setting theory]] is another work that Noelle-Neumann builds on as she is characterizing media's effect on the public opinion. Agenda-setting theory describes the relationship between media and public opinion by asserting that the public importance of an issue depends on its salience in the media.&lt;ref name="AgendaSetting"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaw|first2=D. L|date=1972|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=36|issue=2|pages=176–187|doi=10.1086/267990|last1=McCombs|first1=M. E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with setting the agenda, the media further determines the salient issues through a constant battle with other events attempting to gain place in the agenda.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; The media battles with these news alternatives by creating "pseudo-crises" and "pseudo-novelties."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Media's characteristics as a communication tool further affect people's perception of their own ideas in regard to the public opinion.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; According to Noelle-Neumann, the media is a "one-sided, indirect, public form of communication, contrasting threefold with the most natural form of human communication, the [[conversation]]."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; These characteristics of the media in particular further overwhelm one's individual ideas.

While some media communication theories assume a passive audience, such as the [[Hypodermic needle model|Hypodermic Needle model]],&lt;ref name="CommChar" /&gt; the spiral model assumes an active audience "who consumes media products in the context of their personal and social goals."&lt;ref name="CommChar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ball-Rokeach|first1=S|last2=Cantor|first2=M. G|title=Media, audience, and social structure|date=1986|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge "gained from the mass media may offer ammunition for people to express their opinions and offer a rationale for their own stance."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The spiral of silence: examining how cultural predispositions, news attention, and opinion congruency relate to opinion expression|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=2013-04-01|issn=0129-2986|pages=113–134|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|first=Shirley S.|last=Ho|first2=Vivian Hsueh-Hua|last2=Chen|first3=Clarice C.|last3=Sim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho et al. point out that "among individuals who paid high amount of media attention, those who have a low fear of isolation were significantly more likely to offer a rationale for their own opinion than were those who have a high fear of isolation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Noelle-Neuman regards media central to the formulation of the Spiral of Silence Theory, whereas some scholars argue whether the dominant idea in one's social environment overwhelms the dominant idea that media proposes as the perceived social norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glynn|first1=C. J|last2=McLeod|first2=J.M|title=Implications of the spiral of silence theory for communication and public opinion research|journal=Political communication yearbook|date=1984|pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennamer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennamer|first1=J.D|title=Self-serving biases in perceiving the opinions of others: Implications for the spiral of silence|journal=Communication Research|date=1990|doi=10.1177/009365090017003006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=393–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some empirical research align with this perspective; suggesting that the "micro-climate" of an individual overwhelms the effects of the media.&lt;ref name="Kennamer" /&gt; Other articles further suggest that talking with others is the primary way of understanding the opinion climate.&lt;ref name="Talking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tichenor|first1=P. J|last2=Wackman|first2=D. B|title=Mass media and community public opinion|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=1973|volume=16|issue=4|doi=10.1177/000276427301600408|pages=593–606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
===Fear of isolation===
The fear of isolation is the centrifugal force that accelerates the spiral of silence.{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} Essentially, people fear becoming social isolates and thus take measures to avoid such a consequence, as demonstrated by psychologist [[Solomon Asch]] in the [[Asch conformity experiments]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2012}} People feel more comfortable by agreeing with opinions that they know are wrong instead of telling others their ideas.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

===Assessing the climate===
This assumption proposes that in order to avoid becoming isolated and in order not to lose popularity and esteem, people constantly observe their environment very closely. They try to find out which opinions and modes of behaviour are prevalent, and which opinions and modes of behaviour are becoming more popular. They behave and express themselves accordingly in public. Then, they try to determine whether they are in the majority: whether the public opinion tends to agree with them. If they feel they are in the minority, they tend to remain silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiman|first1=Gabriel|title=Communicating Unreality|date=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=United States of America|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quasi-statistical sense====
Individuals use what is described as "an innate ability" or quasi-statistical sense to gauge [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name= "Miller 2005:278"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2005|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}
{{Quote|The [[Mass media]] play a large part in determining what the dominant opinion is, since our direct observation is limited to a small percentage of the population. The mass media have an enormous impact on how public opinion is portrayed, and can dramatically impact an individual's perception about where public opinion lies, whether or not that portrayal is factual.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} }}

====Pluralistic ignorance====
[[Pluralistic ignorance]] may occur in some cases, leading to the minority opinion to be accepted as a norm. Group members may be privately rejecting a norm, but may falsely assume that other group members accept it. This phenomenon may cause a group to hold on to a norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=J. Nicole|title=Intergroup Contact and Pluralistic Ignorance|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2005|volume=88|issue=1|pages=91–107|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.91|pmid=15631577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of public opinion matters===
Our evaluation of a public opinion has an effect on our decision to speak up. Where opinions are relatively definite and static – customs, for example – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated. Individuals tend to publicly express their opinions and attitudes when they perceive their view to be dominant or on the rise. Conversely, when individuals perceive that their opinion is less popular or losing popularity, they are less likely to voice it in public. What one individual decides to do affects all of society around them.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Vocal minority and hardcore==
The theory explains a ''vocal minority'' (the complement of the ''[[silent majority]]'') by stating that people who are highly educated, or who have greater affluence, and the few other cavalier individuals who do not fear isolation, are likely to speak out regardless of public opinion.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=279}} It further states that this minority is a necessary factor of change while the compliant majority is a necessary factor of stability, with both being a product of evolution. There is a vocal minority, which remains at the top of the spiral in defiance of threats of isolation.

This theory calls these vocal minorities the hardcore nonconformist or the avant-garde. Hardcore nonconformists are "people who have already been rejected for their beliefs and have nothing to lose by speaking out."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} The hardcore has the ability to reconfigure majority opinion. While the [[avant-garde]] are "the intellectuals, artists, and reformers in the isolated minority who speak out because they are convinced they are ahead of the times."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}}

==Application of the theory==
The spiral of silence has brought insight regarding diverse topics, ranging from speaking about popular culture phenomena,&lt;ref name=PopCulture&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wedel|first1=T|title=The spiral of silence in popular culture: applying a public opinion theory to radio station popularity|journal=California State University|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; to smoking.{{Sfn|Shanahan|Scheufele|Yang|Hizi|2004}} Considering that the spiral of silence is more likely to occur in controversial issues and issues with a moral component,&lt;ref name=NoelleBook /&gt; many scholars have applied the theory to controversial topics, such as [[abortion]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAbortion&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=C.T|last2=Neuwirth|first2=k|title=Perceptions of opinion "climates" and willingness to discuss the issue of abortion|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1990|volume=67|issue=3|pages=567–577|doi=10.1177/107769909006700312}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[affirmative action]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAffirmative&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moy|first1=P|last2=Domke|first2=D|last3=Stamm|first3=K|title=The spiral of silence and public opinion on affirmative action|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2001|volume=78|issue=1|pages=7–25|doi=10.1177/107769900107800102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=SpiralOnCapital&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=A.F|title=Exploring the Forms of Self-Censorship: On the Spiral of Silence and the Use of Opinion Expression Avoidance Strategies|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=4|pages=785–802|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00368.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross cultural studies===
Existing literature prior to the spiral of silence theory suggest a relationship between social [[conformity]] and [[culture]], motivating communication scholars to conduct cross-cultural analysis of the theory. Scholars in the field of [[psychology]] in particular previously addressed the cultural variance involved in the conformity to the majority opinion.&lt;ref name=Milgram&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milgram|first1=S|title=Nationality and conformity|journal=Scientific American|date=1961|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45|volume=205|issue=6|pages=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies confirm the link between conformity and culture: a [[meta-analysis]] regarding [[Asch conformity experiments]], for example, suggest that [[Collectivism|collectivist]] cultures are more likely to exhibit conformity than the individualistic cultures.&lt;ref name=MetaAsch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bond|first1=Rod|last2=Smith|first2=Peter B.|title=Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgment task.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1996|volume=119|issue=1|pages=111–137|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The United States and Taiwan====
''A Cross Cultural Test of the Spiral of Silence'' by Huiping Huang analyzes the results of a telephone survey done in Taiwan and the United States. The hypotheses tested were the beliefs that the United States is [[individualistic culture|an "individualistic" society]], while Taiwan is a "[[collectivist]]" society. This suggested that the spiral of silence is less likely to be activated in the United States, because individuals are more likely to put emphasis on their personal goals. They put the "I" identity over the "we" identity, and strive for personal success. Therefore, it was hypothesized that they would be more likely to speak out, regardless of if they are in the minority. On the other hand, it was predicted that individuals in Taiwan put more emphasis on the collective goal, so they would conform to the majority influence in hopes of avoiding tension and conflict. The study also tested the effect of motives, including [[self-efficacy]] and [[self-assurance]].

Telephone surveys were conducted; the citizens of the United States were questioned in regards to American involvement in [[Somalia]], and the citizens of Taiwan about the possibility of a direct presidential election. Both issues focused on politics and human rights, and were therefore comparable. Respondents were asked to choose "favor," "neutral" or "oppose" in regards to the categories of themselves, family and friends, the media, society, and society in the future about the given issue. Measurements were also taken regarding the [[individualism]] and collectivism constructs, and the "motives of not expressing opinion" based on a 1–10 and 1–5 scale respectively, in approval of given statements.

Results showed support for the original hypothesis. Overall, Americans were more likely to speak out than Taiwanese. Being incongruous with the majority lessened the motivation of the Taiwanese to speak out (and they had a higher collectivist score), but had little effect on the Americans. In Taiwan, future support and belief of society played a large role in likeliness to voice an opinion, and support that the activation of the spiral of silence is in effect. In the United States, it was hypothesized that because they were more individualistic, they would be more likely to speak out if in the minority, or incongruous group. However, this was not true, but Huang suggests that perhaps the issue chosen was not directly prevalent, and therefore, they found it "unnecessary to voice their objections to the majority opinion." Lack of self-efficacy led to lack of speaking out in both countries.{{Sfn|Huang|2005}}

====Basque nationalism====
''Basque Nationalism and the Spiral of Silence'' is an article by Spencer and Croucher that analyzes the public perception of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, a militant separatist group) in Spain and France. This study was conducted in a similar way as above, with Basque individuals from Spain and France being questioned about their support of ETA. They were asked questions such as "How likely would you be to enter into a conversation with a stranger on a train about ETA?" Taken into consideration were the cultural differences of the two different regions in which ETA existed.

The results supported the theory of the spiral of silence. While there was a highly unfavorable opinion of the group, there was a lack of an outcry to stop it. Individuals claimed that they were more likely to voice their opinions to non-Basques, suggesting that they have a "fear of isolation" in regards to fellow [[Basques]]. Furthermore, the Spanish individuals questioned were more likely to be silent because of their greater proximity to the violent acts.{{Sfn|Spencer|Stephen|2008}}

===Perceptions in the classroom===
One study, by Henson and Denker "investigates perceptions of silencing behaviors, [[political affiliation]], and political differences as correlates to perceptions of university [[classroom climate]]s and [[communication behavior]]s."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} They looked at whether students' view of the classroom changes whether they perceive the instructor and other classmates with a different political affiliation, with the instructor and other classmates communicating using silencing behaviors. The article stated that little has been investigated into student-teacher interactions in the classroom, and how the students are influenced.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The goal of the article was to "determine how political ideas are expressed in the university classrooms, and thus, assess the influence of classroom communication on the perceptions of political tolerance."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The article claimed that university classrooms are an adequate place to scrutinize the spiral of silence theory because it is a place that has [[interpersonal communication|interpersonal]], [[cultural communication|cultural]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[political communication]]. Henson and Denker said, "Because classroom interactions and societal discourse are mutually influential, instructors and students bring their own biases and cultural perspectives into the classroom."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The study researched whether there was a correlation between students' perception that they were being politically silenced and their perceived differences in student-instructor political affiliation. The study also questioned whether there was any connection between the perceived climate and the similarity of the student and instructor on their political affiliations.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The researchers used participants from a Midwestern university's communication courses. The students answered a survey over their perceptions of political silencing, classroom climate, and the climate created by the instructor. The results of this research found that there is a positive relationship of the perceived similarities in political party and [[political ideology|ideological]] differences of the student and instructor to perceived greater political silencing.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

===In computer-mediated communication===
While the studies regarding the spiral of silence theory focused on [[face-to-face interaction]] before 2000, the theory was later applied to a [[computer-mediated communication]] environment. The first study in this context analyzed communication behaviors in online chat rooms regarding the issue of abortion, and revealed that minority opinion holders were more likely to speak out, whereas their comments remained neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDevitt|first1=M.|title=Spiral of Moderation: Opinion Expression in Computer-Mediated Discussion|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 December 2003|volume=15|issue=4|pages=454–470|doi=10.1093/ijpor/15.4.454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study focused on the Korean bulletin board postings regarding the national election, and found a relationship between online postings and the presentation of candidates in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name=OnlineKorea&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jung Choi|first1=Yun|last2=Lee|first2=Cheolhan|last3=Hyuk Lee|first3=Jong|title=Influence of poll results on the advocates' political discourse: An application of functional analysis debates to online messages in the 2002 Korean presidential election|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=March 2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=95–110|doi=10.1080/0129298042000195189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third study focuses on the online review system, suggesting that the fear of isolation tend to reduce the willingness of members to voice neutral and negative reviews.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Silence in the crowd: The spiral of silence contributing to the positive bias of opinions in an online review system|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/17/11/1811|journal=[[New Media &amp; Society]]|date=1 December 2015|issn=1461-4448|pages=1811–1829|volume=17|issue=11|doi=10.1177/1461444814535190|language=en|first=David A.|last=Askay}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiral of Silence Theory is extended "into the context of non-anonymous multichannel communication platforms" and "the need to consider the role of communicative affordances in online opinion expression" is also addressed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===In social media contexts===
Current literature suggests that the spiral model can be applied to the [[social media]] context. Gearhart and Zhang conduct a study to examine whether or not the use of social media will increase people's motivation to express their opinions about political issues. The results suggest that social media users "who have received a strong negative reaction to their politically related posts are likely to censor themselves, exemplifying the spiral of silence effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Was It Something I Said?" "No, It Was Something You Posted!" A Study of the Spiral of Silence Theory in Social Media Contexts|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2014.0443|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|date=2015-04-16|pages=208–213|volume=18|issue=4|doi=10.1089/cyber.2014.0443|language=en|first=Sherice|last=Gearhart|first2=Weiwu|last2=Zhang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another research confirms the positive relationship between speaking out and issue importance on the social media context as well: individuals who view [[Gay bashing|gay bullying]] as a significant social issue are more likely to comment on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gearhart|first1=S.|last2=Zhang|first2=W.|title=Gay Bullying and Online Opinion Expression: Testing Spiral of Silence in the Social Media Environment|journal=Social Science Computer Review|date=23 September 2013|volume=32|issue=1|pages=18–36|doi=10.1177/0894439313504261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social capital===
The spiral of silence theory can be also applied to [[social capital]] context. Recent studies see social capital as "a variable that enables citizens to develop norms of trust and reciprocity, which are necessary for successful engagement in collective activities".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Social Capital and the Spiral of Silence|last=Dalisay|first=Francis|date=2012|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds023|pmid=|accessdate=|last2=Hmielowski|first2=Jay D.|last3=Kushin|first3=Matthew James|last4=Yamamoto|first4=Masahiro|volume=24|issue=3|pages=325–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study examines three individual-level indicators of social capital--[[civic engagement]], trust and neighborliness, and the relationship between these indicators and people's willingness to express their opinions and their perception of support for one's opinions. The results suggest that civic engagement has a direct effect on people's willingness to express their opinions and neighborliness and trust had direct positive effects on people's perception of support for one's opinions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, the study shows that "only a direct (but not indirect) effect of civic engagement on opinion expression further highlights a potential difference between bonding and bridging social capital".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Internet==
===Isolating the factors that remove isolation===
The concept of isolation has a variety of definitions, dependent upon the circumstances it is investigated in. In one instance the problem of isolation has been defined as [[social withdrawal]], defined as low relative frequencies of peer interaction.{{Sfn|O'Connor|1969}}{{Sfn|O'Connor|1972}} Other researchers have defined isolation as low levels of peer acceptance or high levels of [[peer rejection]].{{Sfn|Gottman|Gonso|Rasmussen|1975}} Research that considers isolation with regard to the Internet either focuses on how the Internet makes individuals more isolated from society by cutting off their contact from live human beings{{Sfn|Kraut|Patterson|Lundmark|Kiesler|1998}}{{Sfn|Moody|2001}}{{Sfn|Sleek|1998}} or how the Internet decreases [[social isolation]] of people by allowing them to expand their [[social network]]s and giving them more means to stay in touch with friends and family.{{Sfn|Morris|Ogan|2002}}{{Sfn|Bradley|Poppen|2003}} Since the development of the Internet, and in particular the [[World Wide Web]], a wide variety of groups have come into existence, including Web and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[newsgroup]]s, multiuser dimensions (MUDs), and, more recently, commercial [[virtual communities]].{{Sfn|Sassenberg|2002}} The theories and hypotheses about how [[Internet]]-based groups impact individuals are numerous and wide-ranging. Some researchers view these fast growing virtual chat cliques, [[online game]]s, or computer-based marketplaces as a new opportunity, particularly for stigmatized people, to take a more active part in social life.{{Sfn|Rheingold|1993}}{{Sfn|Cummings|Sproull|Kiesler|2002}}{{Sfn|McKenna|Bargh|1998}}

Traditionally, social isolation has been represented as a one-dimensional construct organized around the notion of a person's position outside the [[peer group]] and refers to isolation from the group as a result of being excluded from the group by peers.{{Sfn|Bowker|Bukowski|Zargarpour|Hoza|1998}} From children to adults, literature shows that people understand the concept of isolation and fear the repercussions of being isolated from groups of which they are a member. Fearing isolation, people did not feel free to speak up if they feel they hold dissenting views, which means people restrict themselves to having conversation with like-minded individuals, or have no conversation whatsoever.{{Sfn|Witschge|2002}} Witschge further explained, "Whether it is fear of harming others, or fear to get harmed oneself, there are factors that inhibit people from speaking freely, and which thus results in a non-ideal type of discussion, as it hinders diversity and equality of participants and viewpoints to arise fully."{{Sfn|Witschge|2002|p=8}}

The medium of the Internet has the power to free people from the fear of social isolation, and in doing so, shuts down the spiral of silence. The Internet allows people to find a place where they can find groups of people with like mindsets and similar points of view. Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson stated that "Internet users can seek out interactions with like-minded individuals who have similar values, and thus become less likely to trust important decisions to people whose values differ from their own."{{Sfn|van Alstyne|Brynjolfsson|1996|p=24}} The features of the Internet could not only bring about more people to deliberate by freeing people of psychological barriers, but also bring new possibilities in that it "makes manageable large-scale, [[many-to-many]] discussion and deliberation."{{Sfn|Coleman|Gøtze|2001|p=17}} Unlike [[traditional media]] that limit participation, the Internet brings the characteristics of empowerment, enormous scales of available information, specific audiences can be targeted effectively and people can be brought together through the medium.{{Sfn|O'Hara|2002}}

===Online versus offline===
The Internet is a place where many [[reference group|reference]] and [[social group]]s are available with similar views. It has become a place where it appears that people have less of a fear of isolation. One research article examined individuals' willingness to speak their opinion online and offline. Through survey results, from 305 participants, a comparison and contrast of online and offline spiral of silence behaviors was determined.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009|p=36}} Liu and Fahmy stated that "it is easy to quit from an online discussion without the pressure of complying with the majority group."{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} This is not to say that a spiral of silence does not occur in an online environment. People are still less likely to speak out, even in an online setting, when there is a dominant opinion that differs from their own.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} But people in the online environment will speak up if someone has a reference group that speaks up for them.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} In an online situation, just having one person be there to encourage a minority point of view can put an end to a spiral of silence. Another reason for why the spiral of silence theory has less of an effect online could be that studies do not acknowledge whether the person is more likely to speak out against dominant views offline as well.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} The person might have characteristics that make him comfortable speaking out against dominant views offline, which make them just as comfortable speaking out in an online setting. Even though research suggests that there is a chance people will speak out with their opinions more often in an online setting, silencing of views can still occur. Another research article examined the influence of different opinion climates in [[online forum]]s (opinion congruence with the majority of forum participants vs. website source) and found personal opinion congruence was more influential than the online site in which the forum is situated in.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nekmat|author2=Gonzenbach|journal=JMCQ|year=2013|volume=90|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzenbach and Nekmat said it might be worth researching whether the factors in these studies or other factors cause people to be more comfortable when it comes to speaking their mind while online.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"/&gt;

===Heterogeneity and anonymity===
The nature of the Internet facilitates not only the participation of more people, but also a more heterogeneous group of people. Page stated, "The onward rush of electronic communications technology will presumably increase the diversity of available ideas and the speed and ease with which they fly about and compete with each other."{{Sfn|Page|1996|p=124}} The reason people engage in deliberations is because of their differences, and the Internet allows differences to be easily found. The Internet seems the perfect place to find different views of a very diverse group of people who are at the same time open to such difference and disagreement needed for deliberation. Noelle-Neumann's initial idea of cowering and muted citizens is difficult to reconcile with empirical studies documenting uninhibited discussion in computer-mediated contexts such as [[chat room]]s and newsgroups.{{Sfn|Wanta|Dimitrova|2000}}{{Sfn|O'Sullivan|1995}}{{Sfn|Sproull|Kiesler|1992}}{{Sfn|Hiltz|Johnson|Turoff|1986}}

The Internet provides an anonymous setting, and it can be argued that in an anonymous setting, fears of isolation and humiliation would be reduced. Wallace recognized that when people believe their actions cannot be attributed to them personally, they tend to become less inhibited by [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] and restraints. This can be very positive, particularly when people are offered the opportunity to discuss difficult personal issues under conditions in which they feel safer.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|pp=124–25}}

The groups' ability to taunt an individual is lessened on the Internet,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} thus reducing the tendency to conform. Wallace goes on to summarize a number of empirical studies that do find that dissenters feel more liberated to express their views online than offline, which might result from the fact that the person in the minority would not have to endure taunts or ridicule from people that are making up the majority, or be made to feel uncomfortable for having a different opinion.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}} Stromer-Galley considered that "an absence of [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] cues, which leads to a lowered sense of social presence, and a heightened sense of anonymity" frees people from the psychological barriers that keep them from engaging in a face-to-face deliberation.{{Sfn|Stromer-Galley|2002|p=35}}

The crux of the spiral of silence is that people believe consciously or subconsciously that the expression of unpopular opinions will lead to negative repercussions. These beliefs may not exist on the Internet for several reasons. First, embarrassment and humiliation depends on the physical presence of others.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[computer-mediated communication]], physical isolation often already exists and poses no further threat.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Second, a great deal of [[normative influence]] is communicated through nonverbal cues, such as [[eye contact]] and [[gestures]],{{Sfn|Burgoon|Buller|Woodall|1989}} but computer-mediated communication typically precludes many of these cues. Third, Keisler, Siegel, and McQuire observe that nonverbal [[social context]] cues convey formality and status inequality in [[face-to-face communication]].{{Sfn|Keisler|Siegel|McQuire|1984}} When these cues are removed, the importance of [[social status]] as a source of influence recedes. Group hierarchies that develop in face-to-face interaction emerge less clearly in a mediated environment.{{Sfn|Williams|1977}} The form and consequences of [[conformity]] influence should undergo significant changes given the interposition of a medium that reduces the [[social presence]] of participants.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Social presence is defined as the degree of [[salience (language)|salience]] of the other person in the interaction{{Sfn|Short|Williams|Christie|1976}} or the degree to which the medium conveys some of the person's presence.{{Sfn|Rice|Williams|1984}}

===Equality===
An important issue in obtaining heterogeneity in conversation is equal access for all the participants and [[equal opportunities]] to influence in the discussion. When people believe they are ignorant about a topic, incapable to participate in a discussion or not equal to their peers, they tend to not even become involved in a [[deliberation]]. When people do decide to participate, their participation might be overruled by [[pecking order|dominant others]], or their contribution might be valued less or more, depending on their status.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Dahlberg praises the Internet for its possibility to liberate people from the [[social hierarchies]] and power relations that exist offline: "The 'blindness' of [[cyberspace]] to bodily identity... [is supposed to allow] people to interact as if they were equals. Arguments are said to be assessed by the value of the claims themselves and not the [[social position]] of the poster".{{Sfn|Dahlberg|2001|p=14}}

Gastil sees this feature as one of the strongest points of the Internet: "if computer-mediated interaction can consistently reduce the independent influence of status, it will have a powerful advantage over face-to-face deliberation".{{Sfn|Gastil|2000|p=359}} While status cues are difficult to detect, perceptions about the status converge, and this lessens [[stereotyping]] and [[prejudice]].{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}}

It may be that people do feel more equal in online forums than they feel offline. [[Racism]], [[ageism]], and other kinds of [[discrimination]] against out groups "seems to be diminishing because the cues to [[Outgroup (sociology)|out-group]] status are not as obvious".{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|p=99}} Next to this, the Internet has rapidly and dramatically increased the capacities to develop, [[Information sharing|share]] and [[information organization|organize]] [[information]],{{Sfn|Warren|2001}} realizing more equality of [[information access|access to information]].{{Sfn|Gimmler|2001}}

==Methodological research approaches==
The relationship between the perception of public opinion and willingness to speak-up is mainly measured through [[Opinion poll|survey]]s&lt;ref name=Method&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuwirth|first1=K|title=The Spiral of Silence and Fear of Isolation|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=3|pages=450–468|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In surveys, respondents are often asked whether they would reveal their opinions given a hypothetical situation, right after their opinions about the public opinion and their opinion is received. Whether asking hypothetical questions can reflect real life cases was questioned by some communication scholars, leading to a criticism of this [[methodology]] as not being able to capture what the respondent would do in a real-life situation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Real Talk: Manipulating the Dependent Variable in Spiral of Silence Research|journal=Communication Research|date=1 June 2001|volume=28|issue=3|pages=304–324|doi=10.1177/009365001028003003|last1=Scheufele|first1=D. A.|last2=Shanahan|first2=J.|last3=Lee|first3=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study addressed this criticism by comparatively testing a spiral model both in a hypothetical survey and in a [[focus group]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The findings are in line with the critic of hypothetical survey questions, demonstrating a significant increase in the spiral of silence in focus groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among different approaches to survey methodology, [[cross-sectional study]] design is the leading method employed to analyze and test the theory.&lt;ref name=Method /&gt; Cross-sectional design involves the analysis of the relationship between public opinion and willingness to speak at one point in time.&lt;ref name="Method" /&gt;

While many of the researchers employ cross-sectional design, some scholars employed [[panel data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Cheryl|title=Popularity in a Freefall: Measuring a Spiral of Silence at the End of the Bush Presidency|last2=Baldassare|first2=Mark|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1994|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1093/ijpor/6.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this methodology, three specific approaches have been used. Noelle-Neumann herself tested the theory from the aggregate level. Using this approach, the change process is "observed by comparing the absolute share of people perceiving a majority climate with people willing to express their views over time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The second approach that has been used in Spiral of Silence research is conducting separate regressions for each panel survey wave. The drawback for this approach is that the individual change of climate and opinions perception is ignored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The last approach a few scholars used in conducting Spiral of Silence researches is to use changed scores as dependent variables. However, as intuitive as this approach may be, it "leads to well-documented difficulties with respect to statistical properties, such as regression to the mean or the negative correlation of the change score with the time one state".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
The critics of this theory most often claim that individuals have different influences that affect whether they speak out or not.

Research indicates that people fear isolation in their small social circles more than they do in the population at large. Within a large nation, one can always find a group of people who share one's opinions, however people fear isolation from their close family and friends more in theory. Research has demonstrated that this fear of isolation is stronger than the fear of being isolated from the entire public, as it is typically measured.{{Sfn|Moy|Domke|Stamm|2001}}

Scholars have also argued that both personal characteristics and various culture among different groups will have influences on whether a person will willingly speak out. If one person "has a positive self-concept and lacks a sense of shame, that person will speak out regardless of how she or he perceives the climate of public opinion."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Another influence critics give for people choosing not to speak out against public opinion is culture. Open expression of ideas is forbidden in some of the cultures.{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Some cultures are more individualistic, which would support more of an individual's own opinion, while collectivist cultures support the overall group's opinion and needs. Gender can be also considered as a cultural factor. In some cultures, women's "perception of language, not public opinion, forces them to remain quiet."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Scheufele &amp; Moy, further assert that certain conflict styles and cultural indicators should be used to understand these differences.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

Another criticism of the spiral of silence research is that the research designs do not observe the movement in the spiral over time. Critics propose that Noelle-Neumann's emphasis on time&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; in the formation of the spiral should reflect on the methodology as well, and the dynamic nature of the spiral model should be acknowledged. They argue that the spiral of silence theory involves a "time factor", considering that the changes in public opinion eventually lead to change in people's assessments of the public opinion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthes|first1=J.|title=Observing the "Spiral" in the Spiral of Silence|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|volume=27|issue=2|pages=155–176|date=2014|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edu032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Spilchal, the spiral of silence theory "ignores the evidence of the historical development of public opinion, both in theory and practice, through the extension of suffrage, organisation of political propaganda groups, the establishment of pressure groups and political parties, the eligibility of ever wider circles of public officials and, eventually, the installation of several forms of direct democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Legacy of Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann: The Spiral of Silence and Other Controversies|last=Splichal|first=Slavko|date=2015|journal=European Journal of Communication|doi=10.1177/0267323115589265|pmid=|access-date =|volume=30|issue=3|pages=353–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars also provide understandings of the theory in the contemporary society by pointing out that "it is not so much the actual statistical majority that generates pressure for conformity as it is the climate of opinion conveyed in large measure by the media."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Under the great influence by the media coverage, the climate of opinion "is not invariably an accurate reflection of the distribution of opinions within the polity."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further, Scheufele &amp; Moy{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} find problems in the operationalization of key terms, including willingness to speak out. This construct should be measured in terms of actually speaking out, not voting or other conceptually similar constructs. Conformity experiments have no moral component, yet morality is a key construct in the model. These conformity experiments, particularly those by Asch, form part of the base of the theory. Scholars question whether these conformity experiments are relevant to the development of the Spiral of Silence.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

===False dilemmas and silence of consistency===
Research indicates that while the existence of groups with other opinions than those that are supposed to be dominant in a society opens a possibility for some people to express some different opinions, fallacy assumptions in such groups that criticism of particular aspects of that group's program is support for society's mainstream views is a source of false dilemmas. This research indicates that such false dilemmas, especially when there are inconsistencies both in mainstream views and in organized opposition views, causes a spiral of silence that specifically silences logically consistent third, fourth or higher number viewpoint criticism. The research in question does not find a solution in many approaches of "recognizing cognitive bias" but instead indicate that such assumptions are part of the problem by promoting the myth of one's own group having overcome its bias by institutional means and allegations of rational critical arguments being due to bias in the minds of critics, citing evolutionary research that shows that not only would any predisposition for justification of views be selected against due to costing nutrients without improving adaptivity of behavior, but that the claim that most adult humans are irrational due to missing stimulation of rationality in early childhood is also evolutionarily indefensible as genes for potential rationality would have been totally eliminated by selection before reaching significant population fraction if they needed a society already promoting rationality to manifest themselves adaptively. The research indicates that humans are not inherently irrational but are forced to pretend irrationality by false dilemmas that claim rational criticism to be justifications for irrational resentment, and suggest that openly expressed rationality can be promoted by discussions in which no exclusion based on traditional political scales or beneficiary classifications exist but all allegations of irrational motives as well as assumptions that some opinions are linked  or that criticism of one view is defence of another specific view are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Scott Percival (2012).

However, it is still used by many governments. The subject of this article is the use of torture since the adoption of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which prohibited it.

==Torture in modern society==

Torture is widely practiced worldwide: [[Amnesty International]] received reports of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in more than 150 countries during the four-year period from 1997 to 2000. These accusations concerned acts against [[political prisoner]]s in 70 countries and other prisoners and detainees in more than 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2003 ''Combating torture – a manual for action''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202125125/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2003 |date=2 December 2012 }}, October 2002, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; State torture has been extensively documented and studied, often as part of efforts at [[truth and reconciliation commission|collective memory and reconciliation]] in societies that have experienced a change in government. Surveys of torture survivors reveal that torture "is not aimed primarily at the extraction of information ... Its real aim is to break down the victim's personality and identity."&lt;ref name=Tizon2002&gt;Orlando Tizon, CovertAction Quarterly, Summer 2002. Tizon is assistant director of the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition (TASSC) in Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; When applied indiscriminately, torture is used as a tool of repression and deterrence against dissent and community empowerment.

While many states use torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to international bodies. So a variety of strategies are used to circumvent their legal and humanitarian duties, including [[plausible deniability]], [[secret police]], "need to know", denial that certain activities constitute torture, appeal to various laws (national or international), use of a [[judicial jurisdiction|jurisdictional argument]], claim of "overriding need", the use of [[torture by proxy]], and so on.&lt;ref name=AIImpunity&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/024/2001 ''End impunity: Justice for the victims of torture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230012927/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/024/2001 |date=30 December 2013 }}, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all regimes and governments engaging in torture (and other crimes against humanity) consistently deny engaging in it, in spite of overwhelming [[hearsay]] and physical evidence from the citizens they tortured. Through both denial and avoidance of prosecution, most people ordering or carrying out acts of torture do not face legal consequences for their actions.&lt;ref name=AIImpunity /&gt; UN Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights, Sir [[Nigel Rodley]], believes that "impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of human rights violations and, in particular, torture."&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Rodley, "Report on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment," UN Document A/54/426, 1 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

While states, particularly their prisons, law enforcement, military and intelligence apparatus, are major perpetrators of torture, many [[non-state actor]]s also engage in it. These include [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s, criminal actors such as [[organized crime]] syndicates and [[kidnappers]].

A recent approach to interrogations has been to use techniques such as [[waterboarding]], sexual humiliation and [[sexual abuse]], and [[war dog#Use against prisoners|dogs]] to intimidate or pressure prisoners in a manner claimed to be legal under national or international law. Electric shock techniques such as the use of [[stun belt]]s and [[taser]]s have been considered appropriate provided that they are used to "control" prisoners or suspects, even non-violent ones, rather than to extract information. These techniques have been widely criticized as torture.

==Technology==

While methods of torture are often quite crude, a number of new technologies of control have been used by torturers in recent years.  The Brazilian government devised a number of new electrical and mechanical means of torture during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, and proceeded to train military officials from other right-wing Latin American countries in their techniques.&lt;ref name=Weschler1990a&gt;[[Lawrence Weschler]], ''A Miracle, A Universe: Settling Accounts with Torturers'', 1990: 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; One is the use of tasers and electro-shock devices now widely sold to prison authorities around the world. Minor refinements of ancient techniques--including tearing out fingernails and toenails with iron tools, burning the soles of the feet with clothes irons, and probing between the toes with electric wood-burning pencils--are also widely applied.  Some African nations employ an iron foot-squeezing device patterned after the medieval French boot.

==Inter-state collaboration==

[[File:Vietconginterrogation1967.jpg|thumb|A Viet Cong prisoner captured in 1967 by the U.S. Army awaits interrogation. He has been placed in a [[stress position]] by tying a board between his arms.]]
Substantial cooperation between states in the methods and coordination of torture has been documented. Through the [[Phoenix Program]], the United States helped [[South Vietnam]] co-ordinate a system of detention, torture and assassination of suspected members of the National Liberation Front, or [[Viet Cong]]. During the 1980s wars in Central America, the U.S. government provided manuals and training on [[interrogation]] that extended to the use of torture (see [[U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals]]). The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. The manuals have a chapter devoted to "coercive techniques".

The southern cone governments of South America – Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil – involved in [[Operation Condor]] co-ordinated the [[forced disappearance|disappearance]], torture and execution of dissidents in the 1970s. Hundreds were killed in coordinated operations, and the bodies of those recovered were often mutilated and showed signs of torture. This system operated with the knowledge and support of the United States government through the State Department, Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department.&lt;ref name=JPMcSherry&gt;J. Patrice McSherry, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030316080744/http://larcdma.sdsu.edu/humanrights/rr/PLAarticles/mcsherry.html "Operation Condor: Clandestine Inter-American System"], ''Social Justice'', Winter 1999 v26 i4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government has, at least since the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], used the tactic of [[rendition (law)|legal rendition]] in which suspected terrorists were extradited to countries where they were to be prosecuted for crimes allegedly committed. In the "war on terror" this has evolved into [[extraordinary rendition]], the delivery of prisoners or others recently captured, including terrorism suspects, to foreign governments known to practice torture are Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Human rights activists have alleged that the practice amounts to [[kidnapping]] for the purpose of torture, or torture by proxy. A related practice is the operation of facilities for imprisonment, and it is widely believed torture, in foreign countries. In November 2005, the [[Washington Post]] reported —-  citing administration sources —- that such facilities are operated by the [[CIA]] in Thailand (until 2004), Afghanistan, and several unnamed Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name=WPost2005&gt;Dana Priest, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644_pf.html "CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons"], ''The Washington Post'', 2 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] reports that planes associated with rendition have landed repeatedly in Poland and Romania.&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/07/usint11995.htm "Statement on U.S. Secret Detention Facilities in Europe"], Human Rights Watch, 7 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of torture is geographically widespread. A review by [[Amnesty International]], which did not use the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] as its definition of torture, of its case files found "reports of torture or ill-treatment by state officials in more than 150 countries from 1997 to 2000". These reports described widespread or persistent patterns of abuse in more than 70 countries and torture-related deaths in more than 80.&lt;ref name=stoptorture&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/stoptorture/about.html "Denounce Torture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220234103/http://www.amnestyusa.org/stoptorture/about.html |date=20 February 2006 }}, Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the so-called "[[Dirty War]]" carried out in the 1970s, in particular, but not only, by the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]] from 1976 to 1983, tens of thousands of Argentines were "[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]" by the junta, many never to be seen again. The [[CONADEP|National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In nearly all the cases brought to the attention of the Commission, the victims speak of acts of torture. Torture was an important element in the methodology of repression.

These female prisoners lack all sort of necessary personal possessions and almost always have no water, even for bathing, often drinking this precious liquid full of insects. The food distributed to them is terrible, smells rotten, and is stored in receptacles lacking in hygiene. Even prison officials have complained of the small quantities served. In these "drawers" the women remain weeks and months.

===France===
{{Further information|Torture during the Algerian War|Human rights in France}}
During the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–1962), the [[Military of France|French military]] used torture against the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] and the civilian population. The French interrogators were notorious for the use of man-powered [[electrical generator]]s on suspects: this form of torture was called ''(la) gégène''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

That France has provided a pivotal role in the evolution of western torture practices is the central thesis of the French film ''Death Squadrons: The French School'' by [[Marie-Monique Robin|Monique Robin]].
The French had themselves developed practices in defence of its declining empire through the 20th century, setting up torture "universities" at ''Poulo Condor'' (now ''[[Côn Sơn Island|Côn Sơn]]'') – an island off Vietnam (then [[French Indo-China]], subsequently taken over by the United States) and at [[Skikda|Philippeville]] (now ''Skikda'') in Algeria.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Police abuse]] remains a reality in France today, while France has been condemned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) for the conditions of detention in prisons, including the use of torture on detainees.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Although the law and the Constitution prohibits any kind of torture, such practices happen. In 2004, the [[French police|Inspector General of the National Police]] received 469 registered complaints about illegitimate police violence during the first 11 months of the year, down from 500 during the same period in 2003. There were 59 confirmed cases of police violence, compared to 65 in the previous year. In April 2004, the ECHR condemned the government for "inhumane and degrading treatments" in the 1997 case of a teenager beaten while in police custody. The court ordered the government to pay Giovanni Rivas $20,500 (15,000 euros) in damages and $13,500 (10,000 euros) in court costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41681.htm "2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in France"], US [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]].&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the police station in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near Paris, has been forced to resign after allegations of rape and other violence committed by the police force under his orders.

===Guatemala===

During the [[Guatemalan civil war]] and the repression by the army against civilians and suspected opponents of the military dictatorship, murder (even [[genocide]]), torture, rape and inhumane and degrading treatment was systematically used by the Guatemalan armed forces and police. There is evidence that the [[CIA]], in anticommunist campaigns during the 1980s, was involved in these tortures (in Latin America the threat of communism was often used as justification for dictatorship during the [[Cold War]]). Thousands of victims were tortured and murdered. For example, [[Dianna Ortiz]], an American nun who was teaching poor [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n children in the Guatemala highlands, claims that U.S. personnel were present in interrogation and torture rooms in [[Guatemala City]] in 1989 when she was kidnapped, taken to a secret prison and repeatedly raped and tortured by Guatemalan right-wing forces. Ortiz survived because of her American citizenship. Sister Ortiz chronicled her experiences and recovery in a book, ''The Blindfold's Eyes''.&lt;ref&gt;Dianna Ortiz and Patricia Davis, ''The Blindfold's eyes: My journey from torture to truth'', Maryknoll, New York, 2002. {{ISBN|1-57075-435-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There were other people in the clandestine cell, the clandestine prison, as well, and I could hear terrible screams. Many were killed. I saw some bodies. There were children, as well", wrote Dianna Ortiz.

===India===
India has not ratified the UN Convention against Torture. Custodial deaths and extrajudicial killings are on the rise. The [[Asian Centre for Human Rights]] released its report, Torture in India 2010, at a press conference in New Delhi.

This includes 70.72% increase of deaths in prison and 12.60% increase while in police custody.
The government has stated that it intends to pass the Anti Torture Act 2010 so it can ratify the UN convention against torture. The bill provides up to a 10-year sentence for physical or mental torture by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Cabinet-clears-anti-torture-bill/articleshow/5776064.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Cabinet clears anti-torture bill | date=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of torture in Iran published in 1999, Iranian-born political historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]] included Iran along with "[[Stalinism|Stalinist Russia]], [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)|Maoist China]], and early modern Europe" of the [[Inquisition]] and [[Witch-hunt#Early Modern Europe|witch hunts]], as societies that "can be considered to be in a league of their own" in the systematic use of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' 1999, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture techniques used in the Islamic Republic include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;whipping, sometimes of the back but most often of the feet with the body tied on an iron bed; the qapani; deprivation of sleep; suspension from ceiling and high walls; twisting of forearms until they broke; crushing of hands and fingers between metal presses; insertion of sharp instruments under the fingernails; cigarette burns; submersion under water; standing in one place for hours on end; mock executions; and physical threats against family members. Of these, the most prevalent was the whipping of soles, obviously because it was explicitly sanctioned by the sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', 1999, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] International, reports that the widespread practice of [[rape|raping]] women imprisoned for engaging in political protest has been effective in keeping female college students "less outspoken and less likely to take part" in political demonstrations. The journal quotes an Iranian college student as saying, "most of the girls arrested are raped in jail. Families can't cope with that."&lt;ref&gt;1 August 2008,  "Among Scholars, Resistance and Resilience in Iran, Tradition of dissent survives despite government pressure" By AISHA LABI, ''Chronicle of Higher Education International''&lt;/ref&gt;

Several bills passed the [[Majlis of Iran|Iranian Parliament]] that would have had Iran joining the international convention on banning torture in 2003 when [[Iranian reform movement|reformists]] controlled Parliament, but were rejected by the [[Guardian Council]].&lt;ref name=PayvandGuarCou&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/03/aug/1073.html Iran: Guardian Council turns down Majlis bills on women's rights, torture ban], ''Payvand's Iran News'', 13 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2003-01-10"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE4DF1F3EF933A25752C0A9659C8B63 Iran: Ban on Torture Rejected], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===

The government headed by [[Baath Party|Baathist]] [[Saddam Hussein]] made extensive use of torture, including at the notorious [[Abu Ghraib prison]].

The post-[[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] [[Iraqi Interim Government|Iraqi government]] holds thousands of people in prison. After investigating from July to October 2004, [[Human Rights Watch]] found that torture was "routine and commonplace." According to their report,

{{Quotation|Methods of torture or ill-treatment cited included routine beatings to the body using a variety of implements such as cables, hosepipes and metal rods.  Detainees reported kicking, slapping and punching; prolonged suspension from the wrists with the hands tied behind the back; electric shocks to sensitive parts of the body, including the earlobes and genitals; and being kept blindfolded and/or handcuffed continuously for several days.  In several cases, the detainees suffered what may be permanent physical disability.|[[Human Rights Watch]]|3=

Despite apparently credible claims that people were fed into [[Saddam Hussein's alleged shredder|Saddam Hussein's plastic shredder]] (most likely within Abu Ghraib) prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, no such device was found after the war. In October 1990, it was alleged that Iraqi soldiers had "thrown babies from incubators" during the invasion of Kuwait. This story was supposed to have come from the 'eye-witness testimony' of a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl, [[Nurse Nayirah]]. Years later it emerged that she was the daughter of [[Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah]], Kuwait's ambassador to the United States, and that the story was the creation of the [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] public relations firm employed by the Kuwaitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Stauber, J., Rampton, S.}} (1995) ''Toxic Sludge Is Good for You ''.

===Israel===

After investigation of continued allegations of torture, the Supreme Court ruled in 1999&lt;ref name=SCR&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/94/000/051/A09/94051000.a09.htm Supreme Court ruling], (HCJ 5100/94)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://takdin.co.il/searchg/HCJ%20510094%20Public%20Committee%20Against%20Torture%20v.%20State_hd_0L34rDp8qN3KnC30kQ7Hj.html ''Public Committee Against Torture v. State of Israel''], 15 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; that all torture - even moderate physical pressure - was illegal. This decision was praised by human-rights organizations. Despite this reform of the law, [[Amnesty International]] continues to express concerns to Israel about treatment which amounts to torture, and remains unhappy about the steps taken by Israel to eliminate torture. [[Amnesty International]]  stated in 2002:

{{Quotation|...the Israeli HCJ in September 1999 banned a number of interrogation methods ...However the judgment left ... loopholes by which methods amounting to torture or other ill-treatment in detention may continue.|Amnesty International|3=&lt;ref name=AI_Israel&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/074/2002/en/ "Israel and the Occupied Territories: Mass detention in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Amnesty International Index: MDE 15/074/2002, 23 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The human rights group [[B'Tselem]] estimated that 85% of all Palestinian detainees suspected of terrorism are subject to prolonged [[sleep deprivation]]; prolonged sight deprivation or [[sensory deprivation]]; forced, prolonged maintenance of body positions that grow increasingly painful; confinement in tiny, closet-like spaces; exposure to temperature extremes, such as in deliberately overcooled rooms; prolonged toilet and hygiene deprivation; and degrading treatment, such as forcing detainees to eat and use the toilet at the same time. Allegations have been made of frequent beatings. Such acts violate Article 16 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].  In January 2000, B'Tselem claimed that the Israeli [[Shin Bet|General Security Service]]'s (GSS) methods of interrogation amounted to the [[five techniques]]: "[The] GSS used methods comparable to those used by the British in 1971, viz. sleep deprivation, infliction of physical suffering, and sensory isolation. But the GSS used them for much longer periods, so the resulting pain and suffering were substantially greater. In addition, the GSS used direct violence... Thus,... in practice, the GSS methods were substantially more severe than those used by the British in 1971..."&lt;ref name=BTselem2000&gt;B'Tselem, ''Legislation allowing for the use of physical force'', January 2000, pp.32,48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
{{main article|Mau_Mau_Uprising#Mau_Mau_war_crimes}}
[[Mau Mau]] inflicted torture and death on 1,819 [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] during their uprising in the 1950s, along with 58 people of European and Asian descent.

===Lebanon===
Suspected [[Hezbollah]] guerrillas, their families and Lebanese civilian internees were previously detained in the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA) prison at [[Khiam]] in the then Israeli-occupied Southern Lebanon. Torture, including electric shock torture, by the SLA was routine. This was detailed after the end of the occupation in 2000, when Lebanese who freed the prisoners found instruments of torture.&lt;ref name=HRW_Israel&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1994/israel/ "Torture and ill-treatment: Israel's Interrogation of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories"], Human Rights Watch, June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhchr_Israel&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/daf82ddcda36946e80256609004b7df9?OpenDocument "Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture: Israel. 18/05/98"] by [[UNHCR]] Committee Against Torture, Twentieth session, 4–22 May 1998, A/53/44, paras.232–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===

In 2005, Human Rights Watch documented that Nigerian police in the cities of [[Enugu]], [[Lagos]] and [[Kano]] routinely practice torture. Dozens of witnesses and survivors stepped forward to testify to repeated, severe beatings, abuse of sexual organs, rape, death threats, injury by shooting, and the denial of food and water. These abuses were used in campaigns against common crime.&lt;ref name=HRWNigeria2005&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/nigeria0705/ "Rest in Pieces: Police Torture and Deaths in Custody in Nigeria"], Human Rights Watch, July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic torture was used in conjunction with military occupation in an attempt to quell anti-[[petroleum|oil]] protests by the [[Ogoni people]] in the [[Niger Delta]], according to a [[World Council of Churches]] report.&lt;ref name=WCC1997&gt;Deborah Robinson, [http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/dc_4897.html "Ogoni: The Struggle Continues"], World Council of Churches.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian pastors in Nigeria have been involved in the torturing and killing of children accused of witchcraft. Church pastors, in an effort to distinguish from the competition, establish their credentials by accusing children of witchcraft.  When repeatedly asked to comment about the matter, the Church has refused to comment.&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Houreld, [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 "Church burns 'witchcraft' children"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', Sydney, 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Vietnam===
From 1961 to 1973, the North Vietnamese and Vietcong held hundreds of Americans captive. Hanoi's Ministry of Public Security's Medical Office (MPSMO) was responsible for "preparing studies and performing research on the most effective Soviet, French, Communist Chinese and other ...techniques..." of extracting information from POWs. The MPSMO "...supervised the use of torture and the use of drugs to induce [American] prisoners to cooperate." Its functions also "...included working with Soviet and Communist Chinese intelligence advisors who were qualified in the use of medical techniques for intelligence purposes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/warcrimes.cuba.vietnam.html "War Crimes: The Cuban-Vietnam Connection"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718102449/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/warcrimes.cuba.vietnam.html |date=18 July 2008 }}, National Alliance of Families.&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[Con Son Island]] for accounts of US torture practices.

===Palestinian Territories===
The [[Palestinian Authority]] has reportedly practiced torture in the occupied territories over the years. Amnesty International found: "Torture [by the Palestine Authority] of [[detainee]]s remained widespread. Seven detainees died in custody. Unlawful killings, including possible extrajudicial executions, continued to be reported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Recent publications Highlighted research |url=https://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |title=Library |publisher=Amnesty International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208141705/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |archivedate=8 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 cases of torture by Palestinian security services were reported in 2010. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said: "The reports of torture by Palestinian security services keep rolling in. President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are well aware of the situation. They need to reverse this rampant impunity and make sure that those responsible are prosecuted."&lt;ref&gt;"West Bank: Reports of Torture in Palestinian Detention." UNHCR. 20 October 2010.

At least six Palestinians have died under torture in PA prisons. According to a report by the Arab Organization for Human Rights in Britain, the PA has used torture on a systematic basis for years. Methods include beatings with cables, pulling out nails, suspension from the ceiling, flogging, kicking, cursing, electric shocks, sexual harassment and the threat of rape. The report went on to say "Every one of those detainees has been subject to humiliating and degrading treatment and stayed in cells for more than 10 days. The analysis shows that an astonishing 95 percent of the detainees were subjected to severe torture, others feeling the detrimental effects on their health for varying periods."&lt;ref&gt;Abu Toameh, Khaled.

Human Rights Watch reported 147 cases of torture by Hamas in the West Bank during 2011 and that none of the perpetrators had been prosecuted "despite consistent allegations of severe abuse." It further stated that "Some men said they had needed medical care due to torture and sought to obtain medical records as evidence that they had been tortured, but that hospital officials refused to provide them. Hamas’s rival in the West Bank, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, arrests and detains Palestinians arbitrarily, including Hamas members or sympathizers, and similarly subjects detainees to torture and abuse."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/03/gaza-arbitrary-arrests-torture-unfair-trials Gaza: Arbitrary Arrests, Torture, Unfair Trials]. 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another report, Human Rights Watch "documents cases in which [Palestinian] security forces tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained journalists, confiscated their equipment, and barred them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza." HRW also reported an incident in which "the Hamas Ministry of Interior summoned a journalist who published an article on torture by Hamas authorities in secret detention facilities, threatened to take legal action against him if he did not publish an apology for the article, and warned him to correct his 'biased' reporting."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch (6 April 2011).

===Soviet Union===

Torture was widely practiced by the brutal [[NKVD|Soviet secret police]] during the [[Stalinism]] era to extract (often false) confessions from suspects often called [[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]. One of the most prevalent and effective types of torture was [[sleep deprivation]], nicknamed "conveyor" due to interrogators replacing one another to keep the inmate from sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Solzhenitsyn. "The Gulag Archipelago"&lt;/ref&gt; The use of torture was authorized by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] and personally by [[Joseph Stalin]]. During the [[Doctor's Plot]], Stalin ordered falsely accused physicians to be tortured "to death".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/gulag09/00.html "Stalin's torture: 'Beat them to death'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020110400/http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/gulag09/00.html |date=20 October 2008 }}, ''Novaya Gazeta'', Moscow, 16 October 2008. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was still used after Stalin by the [[KGB]] but not on the same extent and level.

===Spain===
The Spanish kingdom categorically denies the existence of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/esp-summary-eng ''AI Report 2004''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218023703/http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/esp-summary-eng |date=18 February 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Spanish authorities consistently fail to implement recommendations by the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee Against Torture to combat the use of torture in detention. The UN committee expressed its concern "about the length of judicial procedures and made reference to reports that indicated that five years had sometimes passed between crime and sentence. The Committee warned that this problem reduces the effect of penal action and discourages people to file complaints." It further indicated that "all members of the Committee were also deeply concerned about the legal practice of five days incommunicado detention" (since October 2003, a reform of the Criminal Procedure Code has extended that period to a maximum of 13 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ishr.ch/About%20UN/Reports%20and%20Analysis/CAT/CAT-29thSession.htm#_ftnref4 |title=Fourth periodic report on Spain in the 29th session of the UN Committee Against Torture |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301143523/http://www.ishr.ch/About%20UN/Reports%20and%20Analysis/CAT/CAT-29thSession.htm |archivedate=2005-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee for the Prevention of Torture, [http://cpt.coe.int/en/states/esp.htm "Spain"], Council of Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Kenya====
During the [[Mau Mau uprising]] of the 1950s, British colonial forces rounded up more than a million of [[Kikuyu people]] — most of them innocent victims of [[collective punishment]] — and imprisoned them in [[concentration camps]] in order to flush out the Mau Mau insurgency. In order to extract information about the insurgency and terrorize the enemy, the British used brutal methods to force Kenyans to confess and repudiate the Mau Mau oath. Under slogans like "labor and freedom" and other variations on "[[Arbeit macht frei]]," inmates were worked to death as slave labor filling in mass graves under cruel conditions. Some men were anally raped with knives. Some women had their breasts mutilated and cut off. Eyes were gouged out and ears cut off and skin lacerated with coiled barbed wire. Interrogation involved stuffing a detainee’s mouth with mud and stamping on his throat until he passed out or died. Survivors were sometimes burned alive, while British guards and interrogators took joy and laughed. British troops denying access to medical aid to the detainees were widespread. A former British officer described a British detention camp in Kenya in 1954: "Short rations, overwork, brutality, humiliating and disgusting treatment, flogging — all in violation of the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]]." According to Canon Bewes, a British missionary, there was a "constant stream of reports of brutalities by police, military and home guards. Some of the people had been using castration instruments and two men had died under castration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Britain's gulag: the brutal end of empire in Kenya |pages=124–145 |publisher=Pimlico |author=Caroline Elkins |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire |pages=150–154 |publisher=W.

Among the detainees who suffered severe mistreatment was [[Hussein Onyango Obama]], the grandfather of [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]. According to his widow, British soldiers forced pins into his fingernails and buttocks and squeezed his testicles between metal rods and two others were castrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title= Kenya: UK expresses regret over abuse as Mau Mau promised payout |date=5 June 2013 |work=The Guardian |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One British settler described the typical British interrogation:

{{Quotation|We knew the slow method of torture [at the Mau Mau Investigation Center] was worse than anything we could do. Special Branch there had a way of slowly electrocuting a Kuke—they'd rough up one for days. Once I went personally to drop off one gang member who needed special treatment. I stayed for a few hours to help the boys out, softening him up. Things got a little out of hand. By the time I cut his balls off, he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him.}}

On 22 November 1954, Colonel Arthur Young sent a letter to [[List of colonial governors of Kenya|Governor]] [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale|Evelyn Baring]] about the "inhumanity" of various parts of the security forces amid his investigations of wrongdoing:

{{quotation|The other lamentable aspect of this case [i.e. Judgment of the East Africa Court of Appeal, Criminal Appeals 891 and 892 of 1954] is the horror of some of the so called Screening Camps which, in my judgment, now present a state of affairs so deplorable that they should be investigated without delay so that the ever increasing allegations of inhumanity and disregard of the rights of the African citizen are dealt with and so that Government will have no reason either to be embarrassed or ashamed of the acts which are done in its name by its own servants. As things are at present there is no one who can investigate such allegations and no independent authority who is responsible for the conduct at these camps. An African who is unfortunate enough to suffer from the brutalities which are clearly evident has no one to whom he can complain and no one to regard his interests since the local Administrative Officer is, himself, the authority for the camps. Moreover, the injured person is unlikely to appeal to the police for redress if they are to be regarded as subordinate to the Executive...I do not consider that in the present circumstances Government have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that in its Screening Camps the elementary principles of justice and humanity are observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighday.co.uk/LeighDay/media/LeighDay/documents/Mau%20Mau/Historian%20witness%20statements/Prof-Elkins-3rd-Statement--Exhibit-CE1-.pdf?ext=.pdf rof-Elkins-3rd-Statement--Exhibit]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In January 1955, Baring sent a telegram to [[Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton|Alan Lennox-Boyd]], the Secretary of State for the Colonies and a cabinet minister, and told them that eight white European officers who had been accused of serious crimes, including accessory to murder, would be given immunity from prosecution. One district officer was accused of the "beating up and roasting alive of one African". A Kenyan Regiment Sergeant and a field intelligence assistance had been implicated in the burning of two further suspects "during screening operations". "I had not myself realised until today that the extension of the principle of clemency to all members of the security forces involved so many cases with Europeans as principals," wrote Baring.&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13044974 |title= British Mau Mau abuse papers revealed|date=12 April 2011  |author=Dominic Casciani |work=BBC |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Baring's administration devised the "dilution technique" — a system of assaults and psychological shocks to detainees, to force the compliance of the toughest Mau Mau supporters. Lennox-Boyd was told that one commander, Terrence Gavaghan, had developed the techniques at the Mwea camps in central Kenya - and he needed permission to treat the worst detainees in a "rough way". Baring telegrammed the Colonial Secretary in London asking for his approval to use "overpowering" force, and the cabinet minister's approval came within weeks. A ministerial delegation saw firsthand prisoners beaten for refusing to don camp clothes. Ringleaders of the "Mau Mau moan" - a chant of defiance - were singled out for special punishment. They were beaten and forced to the ground. Once there, a boot was placed on their throat while mud was forced into their mouths. Gavaghan also explained how difficult detainees would be subjected to the "third degree". "The measures adopted were to be kept awake all night, having water thrown at him and to be beaten up on a variety of pretexts."&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"/&gt;

One Hanslope Park document is a letter between Kenyan Special Branch police officers about treatment of "fanatical" detainees at the Mwea camps.

{{quotation|If they deny having taken an oath they are given summary punishment which usually consists of a good beating up. This treatment usually breaks a large proportion. If this treatment does not bear fruit the detainee is taken to the far end of the camp where buckets of stone are waiting. These buckets are placed on the detainee's head and he is made to run around in circles until he agrees to confess the oath.&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"/&gt;}}

In June 1957, Eric Griffith-Jones, the attorney general of the British administration in Kenya, wrote to Baring, detailing the way the regime of abuse at the colony's detention camps was being subtly altered. He said that the mistreatment of the detainees is "distressingly reminiscent of conditions in [[Nazi Germany]] or [[Soviet Union|Communist Russia]]". Despite this, he said that in order for abuse to remain legal, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body, "vulnerable parts of the body should not be struck, particularly the spleen, liver or kidneys", and it was important that "those who administer violence ... should remain collected, balanced and dispassionate". He also agreed to draft legislation that sanctioned beatings, as long as the abuse was kept secret, and reminded the governor that "If we are going to sin," he wrote, "we must sin quietly."&lt;ref name="MAU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title=Kenya: UK expresses regret over abuse as Mau Mau promised payout |date=5 June 2013 |publisher=guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title=Sins of colonialists lay concealed for decades in secret archive |date=18 April 2012 |publisher=Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
During [[the Troubles]], members of the British Army and the British security forces had routinely used torture on [[List of organisations known as the Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) suspects in [[Northern Ireland]], a part of the United Kingdom.

In 1971, as part of [[Operation Demetrius]], fourteen arrested men were subjected to a program of "deep interrogation" at [[Shackleton Barracks|a secret interrogation centre]]. The interrogation methods involved [[sensory deprivation]] and were referred to as the "[[five techniques]]". The [[European Court of Human Rights]] defined them as ''wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink''. For seven days, when not being interrogated, the detainees were kept [[hooding|hooded]] and handcuffed in a cold cell and subjected to a continuous loud hissing noise. Here they were forced to stand in a [[stress position]] for many hours and were deprived of sleep, food and drink. They were also repeatedly beaten, and some reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls and being threatened with injections. The effect was severe pain, severe physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=mcguffin4&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea4.htm Chapter 4: The Experiment].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcguffin6&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea6.htm Chapter 6: Replay].&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourteen so-called "Hooded Men" were the only detainees subjected to all five techniques together. Some other detainees were subjected to at least one of the five techniques, along with other interrogation methods.&lt;ref name=mcguffin9&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea9.htm Chapter 9: Down on the Killing Floor].&lt;/ref&gt; These allegedly included [[waterboarding]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/6862034/Prisoners-in-Northern-Ireland-subjected-to-waterboarding-by-British-army-officers.html "Prisoners in Northern Ireland 'subjected to waterboarding by British army officers'"]. ''The Telegraph''. 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric shock#Torture|electric shocks]], burning with matches and candles, forcing internees to stand over hot electric fires while beating them, beating and squeezing of the genitals, inserting objects into the anus, injections, [[Foot whipping|whipping the soles of the feet]], and psychological abuse such as [[Russian roulette]].&lt;ref name=mcguffin9/&gt;

Details of the "deep interrogation" program became known to the public, sparking outrage. In response, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] commissioned an inquiry, under [[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Lord Parker]], to look into the five techniques. In 1972 the 'Parker Report' concluded that the five techniques were illegal under domestic law. British Prime Minister, [[Edward Heath]], then announced that the five techniques would no longer be used under his government. However, he said that if a future British government decided to reintroduce them, it would need to be approved by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Tobias. ''This Side of Silence: Human Rights, Torture, and the Recognition of Cruelty''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011. pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] had begun international legal action against the British Government over the Hooded Men in 1971. In 1976, the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] ruled that the program of deep interrogation, using the five techniques, amounted to "torture".&lt;ref name=bbcnov14&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-30177715 "Amnesty calls on Irish government to reopen 'hooded men' case"]. BBC News. 24 November 2014. Retrieved 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was then referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. In 1978 it ruled that the program amounted to "inhuman and degrading treatment" which breached the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but did not amount to torture.&lt;ref name=bbcnov14/&gt; In 2014, evidence emerged that the British Government had withheld information from the Court. Following these revelations, the Irish Government announced in December 2014 that it would be asking the Court to review its judgement and acknowledge the five techniques as torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1202/664159-hooded-men/ "State to apply to have 'Hooded Men' judgment revised by ECHR"] (RTÉ News);[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/government-asks-european-court-to-revise-hooded-men-ruling-1.2022790 "Government asks European court to revise 'Hooded Men' ruling"] (Irish Times); [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-30296397 "Hooded Men: Irish government bid to reopen 'torture' case"] (BBC News). Retrieved 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court's ruling, that the five techniques did not amount to torture, was later cited by the United States and Israel to justify their own interrogation methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caj.org.uk/contents/1264 "The Hooded Men - joint press release from CAJ and the Pat Finucane Centre"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322042506/http://www.caj.org.uk/contents/1264 |date=22 March 2016 }}.

====21st century====
On 23 February 2005, British soldiers were found guilty of abuse of Iraqi prisoners arrested for looting at a [[British Army]] camp called Bread Basket, in [[Basra]], during May 2003. The judge at the military court, Judge Advocate Michael Hunter, said of photographs and the soldier's behaviour:

{{Quotation|Anyone with a shred of human decency would be revolted by what is contained in those pictures. The actions of you and those responsible for these acts have undoubtedly tarnished the international reputation of the British Army and, to some extent, the British nation too, and it will no doubt hamper the efforts of those who are now risking their lives striving to achieve stability in the Gulf region, and it will probably be used by those who are working against such ends.|Judge Advocate Michael Hunter|}}

Donald Payne ...], July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecution alleged that in giving the order to "work [the prisoners] hard", Captain Dan Taylor had broken the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Neither Taylor, nor his commanding officer Lt-Col Paterson (who was briefed on the operation "Ali Baba" by Taylor), was sanctioned and, indeed, during the period of time between the offence and the trial, both were given promotions. All the leaders of the major British political parties condemned the abuse. [[Tony Blair]], British Prime Minister, declared that the pictures were "shocking and appalling".

On 7 December 2005, the House of Lords reversed the deportations of Muslims convicted on "evidence procured by torture inflicted by foreign officials", and cited the 1978 case in ruling that centuries of common law and recent international conventions made torture anathema in the country's courts. Lord Bingham said it was "clear that from its very earliest days the common law of England set its face firmly against the use of torture"; Lord Nicholls said "Torture is not acceptable. This is a bedrock moral principle in this country"; Lord Hoffman said "The use of torture is dishonourable. It corrupts and degrades the state which uses it and the legal system which accepts it."; Lord Hope said it was "one of most evil practices known to man"; Lord Rodgers said "the unacceptable nature of torture ... has long been unquestioned in this country."; Lord Carswell referred to the "abhorrence felt by civilised nations for the use of torture"; and Lord Brown said that "torture is an unqualified evil. It can never be justified. Rather it must always be punished.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd051208/aand.pdf House of Lords Session 2005–06] 2005 UKHL 71 on appeal from: [2004] EWCA Civ 1123.

On 13 March 2007, the six-month court martial of the seven soldiers – including Colonel Jorge Mendonca and Major Michael Peebles – over the detention of Iraqi prisoners in Basra during May 2003 ended with all but one, [[Corporal]] [[Donald Payne (soldier)|Donald Payne]], being acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6445633.stm "'Historic' abuse court martial ends"], BBC News, 13 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Morris and Richard Norton-Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/feb/15/iraq.military "Colonel and three of his men cleared over abuse of detained Iraqis"], ''The Guardian'', London, 15 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 2007, Payne, Britain's first convicted war criminal found guilty under the provisions of the [[International Criminal Court Act 2001]], who had pleaded guilty to mistreating prisoners, was jailed for a year and dishonourably discharged from the army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6609237.stm "UK soldier jailed over Iraq abuse"], BBC News, 30 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1545464/Timeline-Road-to-military-trial.html "Timeline: Road to military trial"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', London, 15 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"This think piece is about the law produced and invoked by his death."

In March 2008, the Ministry of Defence admitted breaching the human rights of [[Baha Mousa]], who died in British custody in Basra, and of eight other Iraqi men held at the same facility, opening the way for a multimillion-pound compensation package for the relatives of Baha Mousa and the other men injured during illegal interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7316943.stm  "MoD to admit breach on Mousa case"], BBC News, 27 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2008, Defence Secretary [[Des Browne]] announced in the House of Commons that there would be a [[public inquiry]] into the death of Baha Mousa in which "no stone [will be left] unturned in investigating his tragic death."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6360845.stm "Timeline: Iraqi abuse trial"] BBC News, 10 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2008, the [[Joint Committee on Human Rights]] accused Armed Forces Minister [[Adam Ingram (Labour politician)|Adam Ingram]] in 2004 and Lieutenant-General [[Robin Brims]], Commander Field Army, in 2006 of misleading the committee when they declared that conditioning practices (based on the [[five techniques]], banned since their use in Northern Ireland in the 1970s) were not being used. It has now emerged that such techniques were being used by some troops deployed abroad. The BBC reported that "Labour MP Andrew Dismore, chairman of the committee, said he hoped the [[public inquiry]] [into the death of Baha Mousa] would give some indications as to why they were given 'wrong evidence'. Earlier this month, the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|MoD]] agreed to pay almost £3m in compensation to Mr Mousa's family and nine Iraqi men after admitting breaching human rights".&lt;ref name=BBC-2008-07-27&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7527369.stm "MPs 'misled' over interrogation"], BBC News, 27 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the United States is a party to international conventions against torture, a proponent of human rights treaties and a critic of torture by other countries, torture has taken place within its borders and on its government's behalf outside of its borders.

On 13 December 1999, [[NYPD]] [[police officer|officer]] Justin Volpe was sentenced to thirty years in prison for sodomizing detainee [[Abner Louima]] with the handle of a bathroom [[plunger]].&lt;ref name=LouimaRefs&gt;Volpe pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.[http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/25/police.torture.02/index.html "Policeman in torture case changes plea to guilty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514000001/http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/25/police.torture.02/index.html |date=14 May 2006 }}, CNN, 25 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/archive/national/louima/121399_volpe_sentence_ctv.html "Volpe receives 30-year sentence for sodomy in Louima brutality case"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050330000636/http://www.courttv.com/archive/national/louima/121399_volpe_sentence_ctv.html |date=30 March 2005 }}, ''Court TV'', 13 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chicago Police Department]]'s Area 2 unit under Commander [[Jon Burge]] repeatedly used electroshock, near-suffocation by plastic bags and excessive beating on suspects in the 1970s and 1980s. The City of Chicago's Office of Professional Standards (OPS) concluded that the physical abuse was systematic and, "The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture."&lt;ref name=Progr1994&gt;Paige Bierma, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_n7_v58/ai_15533722 "Torture behind bars: right here in the United States of America"], ''The Progressive'', July 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supermax facility at the Maine State Prison has been the scene of video-taped forcible extractions that Lance Tapley in the [[Portland Phoenix]] wrote "look[ed] like torture."&lt;ref name=Tapley&gt;Lance Tapley, [http://www.portlandphoenix.com/features/top/ts_multi/documents/05081722.asp "Torture in Maine’s prison"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316080202/http://portlandphoenix.com/features/top/ts_multi/documents/05081722.asp |date=16 March 2006 }}, ''Portland Phoenix'', 11–17 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 and 2004 there was substantial controversy over the "[[stress and duress]]" methods that were used in the U.S. [[War on Terrorism]] that had been sanctioned by the U.S. Executive branch of government at Cabinet level.&lt;ref name=WP_June20&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56753-2004Jun20.html "Torture Policy" (Editorial)], ''The Washington Post'', 21 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] and numerous commentators have accused the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] of approving a system that uses torture, destroying the mechanisms for judicial review created by the Supreme Court ruling in [[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]], and creating a parallel legal system below international standards.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR51/155/2006/en "Rubber stamping violations in the 'war on terror': Congress fails human rights"], 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Scheinin, [http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/13A2242628618D12C12572140030A8D9?opendocument "UN expert on human rights and counterterrorism concerned that Military Commissions Act is now law in United States"], UN High Commission for Human Rights, 27 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/alumni/email/InBrief/2006Spring/charney_lecture_06.html "The Rule against Torture as a Legal Archetype"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906050258/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/alumni/email/InBrief/2006Spring/charney_lecture_06.html |date=6 September 2006 }}, Charney Lecture, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''Washington Post'', the [[convening authority]] of the [[Guantanamo military commissions]], [[Susan J. Crawford]], a retired judge, who was responsible for reviewing practices at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], said of one Guantanamo Bay detainee, "his treatment met the legal definition of torture, and that is why I did not refer the case" for prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011303372.html?hpid=topnews "Detainee Tortured, Says U.S. Official"], ''The Washington Post'', 13 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government denies that torture is being conducted in the detention camps at [[Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/press/2001/11/TortureQandA.htm Human Rights Watch], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Priest and Barton Gellman, "U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations", ''The Washington Post'', 26 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in June 2008 that, according to human rights lawyers, the USA was "operating floating prisons to house those arrested in its war on terror":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"According to research carried out by Reprieve, the US may have used as many as 17 ships as 'floating prisons' since 2001. Detainees are interrogated aboard the vessels and then rendered to other, often undisclosed, locations, it is claimed. Ships that are understood to have held prisoners include the [[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS Bataan]] and [[USS Peleliu (LHA-5)|USS Peleliu]]. A further 15 ships are suspected of having operated around the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which has been used as a military base by the UK and the Americans.
&lt;br /&gt;
... The Reprieve study includes the account of a prisoner released from Guantánamo Bay, who described a fellow inmate's story of detention on an amphibious assault ship. 'One of my fellow prisoners in Guantánamo was at sea on an American ship with about 50 others before coming to Guantánamo ... he was in the cage next to me. He told me that there were about 50 other people on the ship. They were all closed off in the bottom of the ship. The prisoner commented to me that it was like something you see on TV. The people held on the ship were beaten even more severely than in Guantánamo.'"&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell and Richard Norton-Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights "US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships"], ''The Guardian'', London, 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uzbekistan===

After an investigating visit to Uzbekistan, [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on Torture  [[Theo van Boven]] concluded:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/pub/2005/Uzbekistan_Special_Rapporteur_Report_Feb03.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture], UN Commission on Human Rights, February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Even though only a small number of torture cases can be proved with absolute certainty, the copious testimonies gathered ... are so consistent in their description of torture techniques and the places and circumstances in which torture is perpetrated that the pervasive and persistent nature of torture throughout the investigative process cannot be denied.|Theo van Boven|}}

Forms of torture frequently cited include immersion in boiling water, exposure to extreme heat and cold, "the use of electric shock, temporary suffocation, hanging by the ankles or wrists, removal of fingernails, punctures with sharp objects, rape, the threat of rape, and the threat of murder of family members."&lt;ref name=HRWUzbek2001&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/europe/uzbekistan.html Uzbekistan, World Report 2001].&lt;/ref&gt; (For example, see [[Muzafar Avazov]].)

In 2003, Britain's Ambassador for Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, said that information was being extracted under extreme torture from dissidents in that country, and that the information was subsequently being used by Britain and other western, democratic countries which disapproved of torture.&lt;ref name=Telegraph_23Oct2004&gt;Robin Gedye, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4194001/The-envoy-silenced-after-telling-undiplomatic-truths.html "The envoy silenced after telling undiplomatic truths"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', London, 23 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''welcome''' is a kind of [[greeting]] designed to introduce a person to a new place or situation, and to make them feel at ease. The term can similarly be used to describe the [[feeling]] of being accepted on the part of the new person.

In some contexts, a welcome is extended to a stranger to an area or a household. "The concept of welcoming the stranger means intentionally building into the interaction those factors that make others feel that they belong, that they matter, and that you want to get to know them".&lt;ref&gt;George S. McClellan, Jeremy Stringer, ''The Handbook of Student Affairs Administration'' (2015), p. 498, {{ISBN|1119101891}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also noted, however, that "[i]n many community settings, being welcoming is viewed as in conflict with ensuring safety. Thus, welcoming becomes somewhat self-limited: 'We will be welcoming unless you do something unsafe'".&lt;ref&gt;Hunter L. McQuistion, Wesley E. Sowers, Jules M. Ranz, ''Handbook of Community Psychiatry'' (2012), p. 99, {{ISBN|1461431492}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of different practices can go into an effort to welcome:

{{quote|Making a welcome is not a physical fabrication, though welcome may be embodied and fostered by appropriate physical arrangements. There can be an aesthetics of welcome. What is there when one makes a welcome? No thing really, and yet more than any thing. When one makes a welcome one creates the conditions that promise of home. One makes it possible for the other not any longer to feel outside or out of it, but to feel at home.&lt;ref&gt;William Desmond, ''Perplexity and Ultimacy: Metaphysical Thoughts from the Middle'' (1995), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indications that visitors are welcome can occur at different levels. For example, a [[welcome sign]], at the national, state, or municipal level, is a [[road sign]] at the border of a region that introduces or welcomes visitors to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=South African Manual for Outdoor Advertising |publisher= South African Dept. of Environmental Affairs and Tourism |title=Discussion Documents - Class 4F - Gateway Signs |accessdate=2009-04-13 |url=http://www.environment.gov.za/samoac/discDocs/Class_4f.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A welcome sign might also be present for a specific community, or an individual building. One architect suggests that "[a] primary distinction between a gateway and a Welcome sign is that the gateway is usually designed and built by an outsider, a developer or architect, while the Welcome sign has been designed and built by an inside member of the community".&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Isabel Raube, ''Gateways: Site and Structure'' (2001), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[welcome mat]] is a doormat that welcomes visitors to a [[house]] or other building by providing them with a place to wipe their feet before entering.

Another community tradition, the welcome wagon, is traditionally a [[wagon]] containing a collection of useful gifts collected from residents of an area to welcome new people moving to that area.
